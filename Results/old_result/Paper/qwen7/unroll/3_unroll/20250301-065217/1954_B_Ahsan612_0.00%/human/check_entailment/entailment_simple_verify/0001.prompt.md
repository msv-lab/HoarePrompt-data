You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The variable `minn` is an integer representing the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array `ar`. If there are no such segments, `minn` is -1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made into an array of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The function should correctly identify segments where the array is not beautiful.
   - It should find the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property.
   - If it's impossible to break the beauty property, it should return -1.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive identical elements and `minn` to track the minimum segment length.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `num` and `same` as it finds segments of identical elements.
   - After processing the entire array, it checks if `minn` is still infinity (`inf`), indicating no segment was found where the elements were different.

4. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property is flawed.
   - The current implementation only counts the length of segments of identical elements but does not correctly determine the minimum number of removals required.
   - The logic to update `minn` and handle the segments is not aligned with the problem requirements.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest segment of identical elements and calculate the number of removals needed to break the beauty property.
   - We should keep track of the maximum length of identical segments and use this information to determine the minimum number of removals.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
