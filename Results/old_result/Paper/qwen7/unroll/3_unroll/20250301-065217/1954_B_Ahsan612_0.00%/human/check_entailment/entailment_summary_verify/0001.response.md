### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made into an array of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The function should correctly identify segments where the array is not beautiful.
   - It should find the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property.
   - If it's impossible to break the beauty property, it should return -1.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive identical elements and `minn` to track the minimum segment length.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `num` and `same` as it finds segments of identical elements.
   - After processing the entire array, it checks if `minn` is still infinity (`inf`), indicating no segment was found where the elements were different.

4. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that the function calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array. If there are no such segments, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length found.
   - This summary is misleading because the function does not actually find the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property. Instead, it simply finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

5. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property is flawed.
   - The current implementation only counts the length of segments of identical elements but does not correctly determine the minimum number of removals required.
   - The logic to update `minn` and handle the segments is not aligned with the problem requirements.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest segment of identical elements and calculate the number of removals needed to break the beauty property.
   - We should keep track of the maximum length of identical segments and use this information to determine the minimum number of removals.
   - Specifically, if the maximum length of identical segments is `max_len`, then the minimum number of removals needed is `max_len - 1`.

7. **Code Evaluation:**
   - The current code does not implement the correct logic to determine the minimum number of removals.
   - The variable `minn` is not used correctly to determine the minimum number of removals.
   - The code does not account for the fact that removing elements from the middle of a segment can break the beauty property, which is necessary to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
