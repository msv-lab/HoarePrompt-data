### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made into an array of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The function should correctly identify segments where the array is not beautiful.
   - It should find the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property.
   - If it's impossible to break the beauty property, it should return -1.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive identical elements and `minn` to track the minimum segment length.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `num` and `same` as it finds segments of identical elements.
   - After processing the entire array, it checks if `minn` is still infinity (`inf`), indicating no segment was found where the elements were different.

4. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property is flawed.
   - The current implementation only counts the length of segments of identical elements but does not correctly determine the minimum number of removals required.
   - The logic to update `minn` and handle the segments is not aligned with the problem requirements.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest segment of identical elements and calculate the number of removals needed to break the beauty property.
   - We should keep track of the maximum length of identical segments and use this information to determine the minimum number of removals.
   - Specifically, if the maximum length of any segment of identical elements is greater than 1, the minimum number of removals needed is the length of that segment minus 1. If no such segment exists, the answer is -1.

6. **Evaluation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the intended behavior of the function, which is to process each test case and determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property.
   - However, the actual implementation in the code does not align with this description. The code simply counts the lengths of segments of identical elements without considering the requirement to break the beauty property.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to account for the requirement to break the beauty property by removing the minimum number of elements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty property of the array.
