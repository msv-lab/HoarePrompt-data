Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then initializes variables to track the current segment of consecutive identical elements (`same`), the number at the start of the current segment (`num`), and the minimum length of any such segment (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array, updating these variables as it goes.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity, which would mean there were no segments of consecutive identical elements, and prints `-1` in that case. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for identifying segments of consecutive identical elements is correct.
   - The logic for determining the minimum length of such segments is also correct.
   - The handling of the special case where `minn` remains infinity is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles arrays with only one element (where no removals are needed).
   - The code correctly identifies arrays where no segments of consecutive identical elements exist (and thus prints `-1`).
   - The code correctly identifies the minimum length of such segments.

Based on the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
