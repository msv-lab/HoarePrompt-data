Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The variable `minn` is an integer representing the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array `ar`. If there are no such segments, `minn` is -1.
