Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `buffer` is an empty list (this variable is not part of the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for it).
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. For the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting value for `range(t)`), and `t` should be a valid positive integer within the given range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `t` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` must be initialized to 0.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0**.
