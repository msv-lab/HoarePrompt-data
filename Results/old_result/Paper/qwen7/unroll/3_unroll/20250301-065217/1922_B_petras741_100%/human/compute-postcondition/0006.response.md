Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer t (number of sub-cases), an integer n (size of the list a), and a list a containing n non-negative integers. It calculates and prints a result for each sub-case based on the given conditions. If n is less than 3, the output is 0. Otherwise, the output is calculated using a specific formula involving the counts of elements in the list a. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the results for each sub-case.**
