You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers \(x\) and \(n\) from input, where \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\). It then calculates and prints the maximum value between any divisor \(i\) of \(x\) and \(x//i\) where both \(i\) and \(x//i\) are greater than or equal to \(n\). The function processes up to \(10^3\) test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main logic. This function is never called within the loop where the actual processing happens. Therefore, this function is redundant and should be removed.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It then iterates over a range from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each `i` in this range, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
     - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `i`.
     - Similarly, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Divisibility Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if `x` is divisible by `i` using `x % i == 0`.

2. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The balance is calculated as the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems. The program uses `i` and `x // i` to find potential balances, which is correct because the GCD of `i` and `x // i` would be the same as the GCD of `i` and `x`.

3. **Optimization:**
   - The program only iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is an efficient approach to find the maximum balance.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when `n` is greater than `x` or when `x` is very large.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. The function `func_1()` is redundant and should be removed, but the main logic is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
