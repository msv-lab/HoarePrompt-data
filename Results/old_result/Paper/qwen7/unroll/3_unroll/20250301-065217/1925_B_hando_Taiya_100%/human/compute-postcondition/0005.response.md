Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This means `t` can be any integer from 1 to 1000.
- `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\). This means `x` can be any integer from 1 to 100,000,000.
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\). This means `n` can be any integer from 1 to the value of `x`.
- `ans` is the maximum value between any divisor `i` of `x` and `x//i` where both `i` and `x//i` are greater than or equal to `n`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the definition of `ans`. The value of `ans` is the maximum value between `i` and `x//i` for all divisors `i` of `x` such that both `i` and `x//i` are greater than or equal to `n`.

The maximum value between `i` and `x//i` will occur when `i` is as close to \(\sqrt{x}\) as possible because this minimizes the difference between `i` and `x//i`. If both `i` and `x//i` are greater than or equal to `n`, then the closest `i` to \(\sqrt{x}\) that satisfies this condition will give us the maximum value for `ans`.

However, without specific values for `x` and `n`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. But we know it will be the maximum value between `i` and `x//i` for the appropriate divisor `i`.

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value between any divisor i of x and x//i where both i and x//i are greater than or equal to n)**
