Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `x`, or `n`. Therefore, their initial states remain unchanged.
