Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not ensure that after each insertion and sorting, the most difficult problem (last element) is removed. Instead, it simply counts the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the corresponding elements in `b` without performing the necessary operations to maintain the non-decreasing order and remove the last element after each insertion.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
3
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

The program would output `2`, but according to the problem description, the correct output should be `2`. However, the program does not simulate the process of inserting a new problem and sorting the array as described, which means it does not accurately determine the minimum number of new problems needed.

A correct implementation would involve simulating the insertion and sorting process as specified in the problem description.
