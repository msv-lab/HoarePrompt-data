Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, and cnt is an integer initialized to 0. i is an integer initialized to 0. After all iterations, cnt is the sum of counts where elements in list b are less than the corresponding or previous elements in list a for each n.
