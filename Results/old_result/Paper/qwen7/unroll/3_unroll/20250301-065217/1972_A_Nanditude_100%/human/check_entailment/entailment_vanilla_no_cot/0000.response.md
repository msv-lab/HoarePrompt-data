Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The logic in the `for` loop is flawed because it does not properly handle the insertion of new problems and the subsequent sorting and removal of the most difficult problem.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        i = 0
        
        # Iterate through the arrays
        for j in range(n):
            while i < n and a[i] <= b[j]:
                i += 1
            if i == n:
                break
            else:
                cnt += 1
                # Insert the new problem difficulty and sort
                a.insert(i, b[j])
                a.pop()
        
        print(cnt)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize the counter `cnt` to count the number of new problems needed.
2. **Iteration**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through the elements of `b`.
3. **Insertion and Sorting**: For each element in `b`, find the position where it should be inserted in `a` such that `a` remains sorted. If the current element of `b` is greater than all elements in `a`, it means we need to add a new problem with difficulty equal to `b[j]`. Increment the counter `cnt` and insert `b[j]` into `a` at the appropriate position and then remove the last element of `a` to maintain the size of `a`.
4. **Output**: Print the counter `cnt` after processing all elements of `b`.

This approach ensures that the array `a` is always sorted and the most difficult problem is removed when necessary, adhering to the problem constraints.
