Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 for each test case, `q` is a lambda function that prints '? %d' % d followed by reading a line of input split into integers and returning them as a map object.**

The code defines a lambda function `q` which takes an integer `d`, prints a formatted string `'? %d' % d` to the standard output (flushed immediately), and then reads a line of input split into integers, returning them as a map object. This function does not change the values of `t` or `n`, but it does introduce a new variable `q` with the described behavior.
