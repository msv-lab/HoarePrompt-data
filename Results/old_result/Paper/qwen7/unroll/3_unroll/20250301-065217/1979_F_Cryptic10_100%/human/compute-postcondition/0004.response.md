Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` indicating the number of elements in a set. For each test case, it repeatedly queries the user to perform operations on the set until only two elements remain. These operations involve removing elements and recording the results. Finally, it reconstructs and prints the original set based on the recorded operations.**
