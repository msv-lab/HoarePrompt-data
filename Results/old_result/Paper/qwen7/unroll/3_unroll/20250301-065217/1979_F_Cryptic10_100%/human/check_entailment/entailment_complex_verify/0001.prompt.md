You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Kostyanych has chosen a complete undirected graph^{\dagger} with n vertices,
and then removed exactly (n - 2) edges from it. You can ask queries of the
following type:

  * "? d " — Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d . Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then "0\ 0 " is reported. 

Find a Hamiltonian path^{\ddagger} in the original graph in at most n queries.
It can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always
exists.

^{\dagger} A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly
one undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete
undirected graph with n vertices contains \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.

^{\ddagger} A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each
vertex exactly once.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Interaction

Interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer n .

Then you can make no more than n queries.

To make a query, output a line in the format "? d " (without quotes) (0 \le d
\le n - 1 ). After each query, read two integers — the answer to your query.

When you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format "! v_1\
v_2 \ldots v_n " (without quotes) — the vertices in the order of their
occurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as
one of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should
immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program
should be terminated immediately.

If your program makes more than n queries for one test case or makes an
incorrect query, then the response to the query will be -1 , and after
receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to
receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.

After outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the
output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit
exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

The interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the
interaction.

Hacks

To hack, use the following format:

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

Each of the following (n - 2) lines should contains two integers u and v (1
\le u, v \le n , u \ne v ) — ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.
Each edge must not occur more than once.

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^5 .

Note

In the first test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75d8c5328ccca8f82b69ba8300140bed4d40ce80.png)

Consider the queries:

  * There are no vertices with a degree of at least 3 in the graph, so "0\ 0 " is reported.
  * There are four vertices with a degree of at least 2 , and all of them have a degree of exactly 2 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Vertex 1 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 4 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 1 . After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * There are three vertices with a degree of at least 1 , among them vertices 2 and 3 have a minimum degree of 1 (vertex 4 has a degree of 2 ). Vertex 2 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 3 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 2 . After this, vertex 2 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the second test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/44d26c229eaff752c0a00c7160792daef41c7502.png)

Consider the queries:

  * Vertex 1 has a degree of at least 3 , but it is connected to all vertices, so "1\ 0 " is reported. After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * The remaining vertices 2 , 3 , and 4 have a degree of at least 0 , but among them vertex 4 has the minimum degree of 0 (vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1 ). Vertex 4 is not connected to both vertices 2 and 3 , so vertex 2 is reported (as it has the minimum number). After this, vertex 4 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the third test case, the graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge.

    #State: t
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` indicating the number of elements in a set. For each test case, it repeatedly queries the user to perform operations on the set until only two elements remain. These operations involve removing elements and recording the results. Finally, it reconstructs and prints the original set based on the recorded operations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Functionality:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n`.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The function `q(d)` is defined to perform a query with degree `d`.
     - It prints the query `? d` and reads the response.
     - The response is split into two integers `(v1, v2)` and stored.
   - The main loop iterates until the set of vertices `vx` reduces to 2 vertices.

3. **Removing Vertices and Tracking Operations:**
   - In each iteration, the program performs a query with `len(vx) - 2` to get the vertex `v1` and its non-adjacent vertex `v2`.
   - The vertex `v1` is removed from the set `vx`.
   - If `v2` is not zero, it means `v1` is not adjacent to `v2`, so `v2` is removed and added to the operations list `ops`.
   - If `v2` is zero, it means `v1` is adjacent to all other vertices, so another query with degree 0 is performed to find a non-adjacent vertex `v3`, which is then removed and added to `ops` along with `v1`.

4. **Constructing the Hamiltonian Path:**
   - Once the set `vx` is reduced to 2 vertices, the program constructs the Hamiltonian path by reversing the operations list `ops` and appending the remaining vertices.
   - The path is printed in the required format.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Query Logic:**
   - The logic for querying vertices with specific degrees and handling non-adjacency is correct.
   - The removal of vertices and tracking of operations is correctly implemented.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - The construction of the Hamiltonian path by reversing the operations and appending the remaining vertices is logically sound.
   - The path is constructed correctly by ensuring that all vertices are visited exactly once.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where a vertex has a degree of 0 (i.e., it is not adjacent to any other vertex) correctly by finding a non-adjacent vertex.
   - The program ensures that the path is constructed within the allowed number of queries (at most `n`).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic to find a Hamiltonian path in the given graph using the specified queries. The program handles all aspects of the problem statement accurately.
