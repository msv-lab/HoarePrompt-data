Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two integers: t and n. Integer t is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and integer n is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^5. The function ensures that the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Based on these inputs, the function performs unspecified operations and returns an unspecified result.**
