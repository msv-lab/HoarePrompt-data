Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates through each test case, reading three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIRS' if true.
   - It checks if \(a < b > c\) and prints 'PEAK' if true.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
3. **Output Formatting**: The program outputs the results in the correct format, with each test case's result on a new line.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements perfectly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
