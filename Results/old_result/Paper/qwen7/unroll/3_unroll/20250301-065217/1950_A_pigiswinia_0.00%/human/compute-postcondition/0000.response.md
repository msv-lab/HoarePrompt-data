Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, the input must still satisfy this condition. Therefore, `t` is now an integer input from the user within the specified range. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they were not involved in this operation.
