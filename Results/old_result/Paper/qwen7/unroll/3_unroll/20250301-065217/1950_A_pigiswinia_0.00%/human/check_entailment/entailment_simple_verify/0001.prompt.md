You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions evaluated for each set of inputs (a, b, c) provided by the user. The value of `t` is determined by the user's initial input, which specifies how many times the loop will run. Each line corresponds to the result of one iteration of the loop, depending on whether `a < b < c`, `a < b > c`, or neither condition is met.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, where it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.
3. For each set of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it checks the conditions:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints 'STAIRS'.
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NONE'.

Now let's verify if this logic correctly implements the problem statement:

- The condition `a < b < c` correctly identifies a "stair" sequence.
- The condition `a < b > c` correctly identifies a "peak" sequence.

The program does not have any syntax errors, and the logic appears to match the problem description accurately. Let's consider the example provided:

- For `1 2 3`, the output should be 'STAIRS' because `1 < 2 < 3`.
- For `3 2 1`, the output should be 'NONE' because it doesn't satisfy either condition.
- For `1 5 3`, the output should be 'PEAK' because `1 < 5 > 3`.
- For `3 4 1`, the output should be 'PEAK' because `3 < 4 > 1`.

Given that the program correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem statement, the logic is sound.
