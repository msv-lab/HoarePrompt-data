### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not construct the permutation \( p \) as required by the problem statement. Instead, it constructs a list of MEX values (`mex`). Let's break down the issues and verify the program against the problem description more thoroughly:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a` for each test case.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the MEX value for each position.
   - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
   - If `arr[i]` is negative, it appends the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn` to the `mex` list.
   - It updates `maxx` if the calculated MEX value is greater than the current `maxx`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the values in the `mex` list, which should represent the MEX values as defined in the problem.

However, the problem requires constructing the permutation \( p \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The program does not actually construct the permutation \( p \) from the `mex` values. Instead, it prints the `mex` values directly, which is not the correct approach.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Construct the permutation \( p \) such that the MEX condition is satisfied.
- Ensure that the permutation \( p \) is a valid permutation of the integers from 0 to \( n-1 \).

Given that the program does not meet these requirements, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not construct the permutation \( p \) as required by the problem statement.
