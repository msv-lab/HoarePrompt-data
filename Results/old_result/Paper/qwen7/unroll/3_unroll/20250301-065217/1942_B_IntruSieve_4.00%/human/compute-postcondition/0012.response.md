Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It calculates a list `mex` which contains values starting from `minn` up to the maximum value in `arr`, along with some differences based on conditions. Finally, it prints each value in `mex` in order, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value but modifies a local list `mex` and prints the results.**
