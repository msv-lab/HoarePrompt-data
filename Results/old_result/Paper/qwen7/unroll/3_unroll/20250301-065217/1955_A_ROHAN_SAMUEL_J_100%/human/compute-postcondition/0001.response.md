Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed based on the conditions within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b + a` depending on whether `2 * a < b` holds true. If `n` is even, it always prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b`. The specific values depend on the inputs provided for each test case.
