Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, a, and b where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers between 1 and 100 and 1 and 30 respectively. The function returns a value based on the relationship between these variables.**

This means the function indirectly accepts multiple sets of parameters (t, n, a, b) through its processing logic and returns a value based on their relationships.
