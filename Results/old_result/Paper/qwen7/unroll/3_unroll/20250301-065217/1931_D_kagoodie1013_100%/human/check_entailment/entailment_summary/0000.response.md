Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Test Case Parsing**: It parses each test case by extracting the necessary values (n, x, y, and the array) and stores them in a list of tuples called `test_cases`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - Iterates through each test case.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` as specified.
   - Uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the occurrences of these residue pairs.
   - For each element, it checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` already exists in the dictionary. If so, it adds the count from the dictionary to the current count `count`.
   - Updates the dictionary with the current residue pair.
   - Appends the final count for each test case to the `results` list.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, which matches the required format.

Given the execution summary and the detailed reasoning above, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
