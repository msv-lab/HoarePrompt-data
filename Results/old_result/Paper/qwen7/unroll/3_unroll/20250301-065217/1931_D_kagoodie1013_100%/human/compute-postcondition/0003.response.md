Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the sum of counts of number pairs `(r_x, r_y)` for each input list `arr` in `test_cases`. Specifically, for each tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`, the loop calculates how many times each pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` appears, where `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` for every `num` in `arr`, and then sums these counts to append to `results`.
