### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y`, and then the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It creates a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the occurrences of pairs of residues.
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
     - It looks up the value in `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)` and adds it to `count`.
     - It updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all numbers in the array, it appends the count to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Key Points to Validate:

1. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation `r_x = -num % x` is correct because it ensures that `r_x` is within the range `[0, x-1]` when `num % x` is negative.
   - The calculation `r_y = num % y` is straightforward and correct.

2. **Dictionary Usage:**
   - The dictionary `residue_map` is used to efficiently count the pairs of residues.
   - The program correctly updates and queries the dictionary.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles large inputs as specified (up to `2 * 10^5` for `n` and `10^9` for `x` and `y`).
   - The program processes each test case independently, ensuring that the results for different test cases do not interfere with each other.

### Evaluation:

Given the annotations and the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The program processes each test case independently and returns the correct count of beautiful pairs for each case. There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
