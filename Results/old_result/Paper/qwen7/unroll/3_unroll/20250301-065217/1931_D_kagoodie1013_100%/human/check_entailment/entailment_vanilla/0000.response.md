Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
2. For each test case, it extracts the necessary values (n, x, y, and the array).
3. It uses a function `func_1` to process each test case and calculate the number of beautiful pairs.
4. In `func_1`, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
5. It iterates through each element in the array, calculating the residues modulo `x` and `y`.
6. For each element, it checks if there exists a previous element with the same residues, which would form a beautiful pair.
7. It updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.
8. Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
