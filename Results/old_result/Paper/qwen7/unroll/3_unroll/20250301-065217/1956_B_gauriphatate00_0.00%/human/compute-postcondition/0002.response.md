Output State: **`idx` is 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, `a` is a list of n integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list.**

Explanation: The code `idx = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `idx`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
