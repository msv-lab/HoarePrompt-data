Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variables `n` and `k` are also involved since they are used to define the range of the loop.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The value of `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `n` being at least 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is 0, as the loop starts with `i = 0`.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)
- `nums` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros

We need to adjust the states of `n` and `i` for the loop to execute.

**State after adjustment**:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (since the loop requires `n` to be at least 1).
- `i` must be 0 (as the loop starts with `i = 0`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
