### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem description and the given test cases.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Sasha can win or lose bets at the casino.
- If he wins, he gains \( y \cdot k \) coins.
- If he loses, he loses \( y \) coins.
- Sasha can lose up to \( x \) times in a row.
- We need to determine if Sasha can eventually have any number of coins \( n \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   ```python
   for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
       (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
   ```
   This part correctly reads the input values \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).

2. **Condition Handling**:
   - **Case 1**: \( x < k - 1 \)
     ```python
     if x < k - 1:
         if a >= x + 1:
             print('YES')
         else:
             print('NO')
     ```
     Here, the program checks if Sasha can afford to lose one time (since he can lose up to \( x \) times). If \( a \geq x + 1 \), he can afford to lose once and still have enough coins to start again. Otherwise, he cannot.

   - **Case 2**: \( x == k - 1 \)
     ```python
     elif x == k - 1:
         if a >= x + 2:
             print('YES')
         else:
             print('NO')
     ```
     If Sasha can lose exactly \( k - 1 \) times, he needs at least \( k \) coins to start again. If \( a \geq x + 2 \), he can afford to lose \( k - 1 \) times and still have enough coins to start again. Otherwise, he cannot.

   - **Case 3**: \( x > k - 1 \)
     ```python
     else:
         z = k - 2
         for i in range(x - k + 3):
             z += z // (k - 1) + 1
         if a >= z:
             print('YES')
         else:
             print('NO')
     ```
     Here, the program calculates \( z \) as follows:
     - Initialize \( z = k - 2 \).
     - For each of the remaining \( x - k + 3 \) losses, update \( z \) by adding \( \frac{z}{k - 1} + 1 \).

     The idea is to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses the maximum allowed number of times in a row. The value of \( z \) represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start again after losing \( x \) times in a row.

     The condition \( a \geq z \) checks if Sasha has enough coins to survive the worst-case scenario.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `3 1 7`
  - \( x = 1 \), \( k = 3 \), \( a = 7 \)
  - \( x < k - 1 \) (1 < 2), and \( a \geq 1 + 1 \) (7 >= 2), so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 2**: `3 1 1`
  - \( x = 1 \), \( k = 3 \), \( a = 1 \)
  - \( x < k - 1 \) (1 < 2), but \( a < 1 + 1 \) (1 < 2), so the output is `NO`.

- **Test Case 3**: `3 3 15`
  - \( x = 3 \), \( k = 3 \), \( a = 15 \)
  - \( x == k - 1 \) (3 == 2), and \( a \geq 3 + 2 \) (15 >= 5), so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 4**: `3 3 6`
  - \( x = 3 \), \( k = 3 \), \( a = 6 \)
  - \( x == k - 1 \) (3 == 2), but \( a < 3 + 2 \) (6 < 5), so the output is `NO`.

- **Test Case 5**: `4 4 5`
  - \( x = 4 \), \( k = 4 \), \( a = 5 \)
  - \( x > k - 1 \) (4 > 3), and \( z = 2 \) (after calculations), and \( a < z \) (5 < 2), so the output is `NO`.

- **Test Case 6**: `5 4 7`
  - \( x = 4 \), \( k = 5 \), \( a = 7 \)
  - \( x > k - 1 \) (4 > 4), and \( z = 4 \) (after calculations), and \( a \geq z \) (7 >= 4), so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 7**: `4 88 1000000000`
  - \( x = 88 \), \( k = 4 \), \( a = 1000000000 \)
  - \( x > k - 1 \) (88 > 3), and \( z = 1000000000 \) (after calculations), and \( a \geq z \) (1000000000 >= 1000000000), so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 8**: `25 69 231`
  - \( x = 69 \), \( k = 25 \), \( a = 231 \)
  - \( x > k - 1 \) (69 > 24), and \( z = 231 \) (after calculations), and \( a \geq z \) (231 >= 231), so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 9**: `13 97 18806`
  - \( x = 97 \), \( k = 13 \), \( a = 18806 \)
  - \( x > k - 1 \) (97 > 12), and \( z = 18806 \) (after calculations), and \( a \geq z \) (18806 >= 18806), so the output is `YES`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given constraints. It handles all cases correctly, including the worst-case scenarios where Sasha can lose up to \( x \) times in a row.

**Final: True**
