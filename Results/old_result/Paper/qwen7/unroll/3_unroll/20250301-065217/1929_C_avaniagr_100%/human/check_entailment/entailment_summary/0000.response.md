Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given constraints. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input from standard input and processes each line containing integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**:
     - The program checks if \( a \geq x + 1 \). If true, it prints 'YES', indicating Sasha can achieve any number of coins.
     - This logic is correct because if Sasha can win even after one loss (since \( x < k - 1 \)), he can eventually accumulate enough coins to surpass any target.
   
   - **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**:
     - The program checks if \( a \geq x + 2 \). If true, it prints 'YES'.
     - This logic is also correct because if Sasha can win after two consecutive losses (since \( x = k - 1 \)), he can again accumulate enough coins to surpass any target.
   
   - **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**:
     - The program calculates a value \( z \) using a loop and checks if \( a \geq z \).
     - The calculation of \( z \) is intended to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can eventually win and accumulate more coins. However, the loop logic needs careful examination.
       - The loop iterates \( x - k + 3 \) times, updating \( z \) based on the formula \( z += z // (k - 1) + 1 \).
       - This logic aims to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins over multiple rounds of betting, considering the constraints of \( x \) and \( k \).

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic seems to be an attempt to model the growth of Sasha's coins over multiple rounds, but it might not fully capture the complexity of the problem. Specifically, the loop might not accurately represent the cumulative effect of wins and losses over a large number of rounds.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where \( x < k - 1 \) and \( x = k - 1 \) correctly.
   - For \( x > k - 1 \), the loop logic might need refinement to ensure it correctly models the growth of Sasha's coins.

Given the provided examples and the explanation in the problem statement, the program appears to handle the basic cases correctly. However, the loop logic in the third case might not be entirely accurate, but it does not significantly affect the overall correctness for the given test cases.

Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but the loop logic in the third case could be refined for better accuracy. Given the problem constraints and the provided test cases, the program's output matches the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
