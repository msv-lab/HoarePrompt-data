Output State: **max_diff is the largest difference found between consecutive elements in the list A, next_max_diff is the second largest difference found between consecutive elements in the list A, index is the index of the element where max_diff was found, left is A[index - 1], right is A[index], ans is the minimum value of max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f) for all f in F where l is the result of bisect_right(D, left - f) and h is the result of bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1, and l equals h.**
