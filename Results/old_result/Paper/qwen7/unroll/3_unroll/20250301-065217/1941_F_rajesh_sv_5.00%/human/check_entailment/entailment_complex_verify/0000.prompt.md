You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_7` is designed to handle multiple test cases, but it does not properly account for adding at most one problem to minimize the imbalance.

Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Function `func_6`**: This function reads the input for a single test case but does not process it. It simply calls other functions to extract the necessary data.

2. **Function `func_7`**: This function is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, it does not correctly implement the logic to add at most one problem to minimize the imbalance. Here are the issues:
   - The function `func_6` is called to read the input, but it does not process the data.
   - The function `func_5` is used to read the number of test cases, but it is not utilized effectively.
   - The function `func_7` does not correctly handle the logic to add a new problem and calculate the minimum imbalance.

3. **Logic for Adding a Problem**: The program does not attempt to add a new problem by combining a model and a function to see if it can reduce the imbalance. Instead, it only calculates the current maximum difference and does not explore the possibility of adding a new problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
