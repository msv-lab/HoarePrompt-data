Functionality: **The function processes three lists: A, D, and F. List A contains the complexities of n problems, D contains unique complexities of models, and F contains complexities of k functions. It finds the largest and second-largest differences between consecutive problem complexities in A. Then, for each function complexity in F, it uses binary search to find the closest model complexities to the boundaries defined by these differences. Finally, it calculates the minimum adjusted difference considering the function complexity and prints the maximum of the largest difference and the calculated minimum adjusted difference.**
