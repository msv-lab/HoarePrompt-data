(n, m, k) are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 × 10^5; A is a list of n integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems, where 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 2 × 10^9 and A[i] < A[i + 1]; D is a list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, sorted in ascending order, where 1 ≤ D[i] ≤ 10^9; F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 ≤ F[i] ≤ 10^9.
