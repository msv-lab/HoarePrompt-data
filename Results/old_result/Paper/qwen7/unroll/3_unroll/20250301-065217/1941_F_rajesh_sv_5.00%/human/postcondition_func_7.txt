The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a sorted list `a`, and lists `d` and `f`. For each test case, it calls `func_6()` without modifying the input lists `a`, `d`, and `f`. The function ultimately returns the result of `func_3()`, which represents the number of test cases processed.
