Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations required to ensure that the smallest element in a min-heap (initialized with the second half of the sorted array) is greater than the median value of the original array. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for each test case.**
