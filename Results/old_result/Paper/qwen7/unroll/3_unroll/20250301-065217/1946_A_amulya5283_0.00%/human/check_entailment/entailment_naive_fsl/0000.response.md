Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program uses a min-heap to increment elements until the element at the median position is greater than the current median. However, this approach does not always yield the minimum number of operations.

Consider the following test case:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The median of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `3`. To increase the median, we need to increment the elements at indices 0 and 1 (since the median index is 2, and we need the third element to be greater than 3). The correct minimum number of operations is 2.

However, the program will increment the elements at indices 0 and 1, resulting in the array `[2, 3, 3, 4, 5]`, which requires 3 operations (incrementing the element at index 0 twice and the element at index 1 once).

This shows that the program does not always find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, making it incorrect.
