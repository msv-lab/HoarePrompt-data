Output State: **The program returns a list of integers called 'results', where each integer represents the number of operations performed for each test case.**

This output state describes that the program returns a list named `results`. Each element in this list corresponds to the number of operations performed for each respective test case, as defined by the input list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. The number of operations performed for each test case would depend on the specific logic applied within those test cases, but the return statement simply gathers these operation counts into the `results` list.
