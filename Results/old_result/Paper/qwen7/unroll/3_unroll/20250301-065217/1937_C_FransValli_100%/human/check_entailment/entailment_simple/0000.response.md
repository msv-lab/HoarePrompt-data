### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the size of the permutation (`n`) for each test case.
   - It initializes `maxi` to 0, which will be used to store the index with the highest bitwise OR result.

2. **Finding `maxi`**:
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it performs a query comparing `(p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})` and `(p_i \mid p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `maxi` to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `maxi` is set to the index with the highest bitwise OR result among the first `n-1` elements.

3. **Finding Potential Candidates for Maximum XOR**:
   - It initializes an array `arr` with `0` as the only element.
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it performs a query comparing `(p_{maxi} \mid p_{arr[0]})` and `(p_{maxi} \mid p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `arr` to contain only `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `arr`.
   - This step narrows down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR by ensuring that `arr` contains only indices where the bitwise OR with `maxi` is at least as high as with `arr[0]`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Index in `arr`**:
   - It initializes `mini` to `arr[0]`.
   - For each index `item` in `arr[1:]`, it performs a query comparing `(p_{mini} \mid p_{mini})` and `(p_{item} \mid p_{item})`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mini` to `item`.
   - This step ensures that `mini` is set to the index with the lowest bitwise OR result among the candidates in `arr`.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - It prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the pair with the maximum XOR value.

### Analysis:
- The logic for finding `maxi` is correct because it ensures that `maxi` is the index with the highest bitwise OR result.
- The logic for finding the potential candidates in `arr` is also correct because it ensures that these candidates have a bitwise OR result with `maxi` that is at least as high as with `arr[0]`.
- The logic for finding `mini` in `arr` is correct because it ensures that `mini` is the index with the lowest bitwise OR result among the candidates, which helps in maximizing the XOR result.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i \oplus p_j` is maximized using at most `3n` queries. Therefore, the code is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
