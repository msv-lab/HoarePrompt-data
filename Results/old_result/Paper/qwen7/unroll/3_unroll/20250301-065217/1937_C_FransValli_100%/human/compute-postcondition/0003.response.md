Functionality: **The function interacts with an external entity to perform queries on indices a, b, c, and d. It compares the bitwise OR results of these indices and finds two indices i and j with the maximum bitwise XOR. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the indices i and j with the maximum bitwise XOR.**
