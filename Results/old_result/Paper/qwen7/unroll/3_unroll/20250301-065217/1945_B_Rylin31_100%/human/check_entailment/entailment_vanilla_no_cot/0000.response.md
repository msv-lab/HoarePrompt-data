Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution attempts to calculate the number of fireworks visible at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for the simultaneous launches of fireworks from both installations correctly.

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The correct approach involves calculating the number of unique times both installations launch fireworks within the visibility period `m`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate LCM of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of unique times both installations launch fireworks within the visibility period
        max_visible = (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm_ab) + 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This solution uses the `math.gcd` function to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, then calculates the LCM using the formula `(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`. It then computes the number of unique times both installations launch fireworks within the visibility period `m` and prints the result.
