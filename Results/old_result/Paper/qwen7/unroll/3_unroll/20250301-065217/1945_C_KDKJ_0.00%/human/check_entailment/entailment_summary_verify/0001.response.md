### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied. If there are multiple positions with the same minimum distance to the center, the smaller index is chosen.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1()`**:
     - Reads the number of houses `n` and the sequence `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
     - Uses a list `S` to store cumulative counts of 0s and 1s up to each house.
     - For each possible position `i`, it calculates the number of 0s (`left`) and 1s (`right`) on the left and right sides, respectively.
     - Checks if the conditions for satisfaction are met on both sides:
       - `left * 2 < lsum` ensures that more than half of the residents on the left side are satisfied.
       - `right * 2 < rsum` ensures that more than half of the residents on the right side are satisfied.
     - Updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` meets the conditions and is closer to the center of the village or has the same distance but is smaller.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - **Cumulative Counts**: The use of cumulative counts is correct and efficient for calculating the number of 0s and 1s on both sides.
   - **Condition Checking**: The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - **Updating the Answer**: The logic for updating the answer `ans` is correct. It ensures that the position closest to the center of the village is chosen, and in case of ties, the smaller index is selected.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All Residents Prefer One Side**: If all residents prefer the left side (all 0s), the road can be placed before the first house, and the function correctly sets `ans` to 0.
   - **All Residents Prefer the Right Side**: If all residents prefer the right side (all 1s), the road can be placed after the last house, and the function correctly sets `ans` to `n`.

5. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The function summary indicates that `func_2()` does not modify the string `a` and does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. The function `func_1()` accurately finds the optimal position for the road, and `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases.
