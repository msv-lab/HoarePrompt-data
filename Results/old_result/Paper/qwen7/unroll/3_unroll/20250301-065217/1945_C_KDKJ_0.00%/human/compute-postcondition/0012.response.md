Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5.**

However, based on the given constraints and the typical structure of such functions, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. The function definition provided does not include any parameters, which contradicts the constraints given. Assuming the intention was to describe the behavior of a function that generates a string based on the given constraints, the correct format would be:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and returns a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.**
