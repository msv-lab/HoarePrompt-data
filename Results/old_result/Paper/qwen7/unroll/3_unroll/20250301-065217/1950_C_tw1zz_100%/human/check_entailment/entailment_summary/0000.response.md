Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It correctly handles the conversion of hours from 00 to 23 to their 12-hour equivalents and appends the appropriate AM/PM designation.
- However, there are several issues with the implementation:
  1. The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to manually map each hour from 00 to 23 to its 12-hour equivalent. This approach is inefficient and error-prone.
  2. The program does not handle the case where the hour is '00' properly. According to the logic, '00' should be mapped to '12' and AM, but the code incorrectly maps it to '12' and PM.
  3. The program does not account for the fact that '12' in 24-hour format is both 12 PM and 12 AM in 12-hour format. This means the code will incorrectly treat all '12' as PM.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly convert all times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

Correctness: **False**
