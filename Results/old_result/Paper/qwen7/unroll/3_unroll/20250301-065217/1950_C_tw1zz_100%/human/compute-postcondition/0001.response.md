Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The value of `h1` is derived from the input `h` by converting it to a 12-hour clock format, and `m` is taken directly from the input `m`. The `time` will be either "AM" or "PM" based on the converted hour. The exact times printed will depend on the inputs provided during the loop executions.
