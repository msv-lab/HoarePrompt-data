Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program can be optimized and simplified. The current implementation uses multiple `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format, which is inefficient and error-prone. A more efficient approach would be to use modulo arithmetic to handle the conversion.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = str((int(h) % 12) or 12)  # Convert 24-hour to 12-hour format
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')


func()
```

This version uses the modulo operator `%` to convert the hour part from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles the AM/PM conversion correctly. It also uses an f-string for formatting the output, making the code cleaner and more readable.
