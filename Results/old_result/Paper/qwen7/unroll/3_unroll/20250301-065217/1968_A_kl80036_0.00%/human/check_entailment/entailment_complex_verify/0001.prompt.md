You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed, each being half of the corresponding input integer \(x\) for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, the value of \(y = x // 2\) will be printed. The number of such outputs will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input integer \(t\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \(t\) and an integer \(x\). For each test case, it calculates \(y = x // 2\) and prints the value of \(y\). The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program takes an integer \( t \) as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{2} \) and prints this value.
3. **Evaluation of the Approach**:
   - The approach taken by the program is to set \( y \) to \( \frac{x}{2} \). This means \( y \) will be \( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \).
   - However, this approach does not necessarily maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Example Analysis:
- For \( x = 10 \):
  - \( y = 5 \)
  - \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \)
  - But, \( y = 9 \) would give \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \), which is the same but \( y = 9 \) is closer to the boundary condition.
- For \( x = 21 \):
  - \( y = 10 \)
  - \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \)
  - But, \( y = 18 \) would give \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21 \), which is better.

From these examples, we see that \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) does not always yield the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the chosen \( y \) maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
