Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000). For each test case, it processes `t` and `x` and returns a result based on the values of `t` and `x`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases, each containing a pair of integers `t` and `x`, and performs some operation or checks on these values before returning a result for each test case. However, since the specific operation is not detailed, the focus here is on the nature of the input and output as per the provided constraints.
