Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program attempts to achieve this by printing specific coordinates:
   - It always prints "1 1" and "1 2".
   - Then, for each \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints "i i".
3. Let's analyze the Manhattan distances generated by these coordinates:
   - The distance between "1 1" and "1 2" is \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - The distance between "1 1" and "i i" for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1)\).
   - The distance between "1 2" and "i i" for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-2)\).
   - Distances between "i i" and "j j" for \(i, j \geq 3\) and \(i \neq j\) are \(2(|i-j|)\).

4. By printing these coordinates, the program ensures that:
   - The smallest non-zero distance is 1 (between "1 1" and "1 2").
   - The largest distance is \(2(n-2)\) (between "1 1" and "n n" or "1 2" and "n n").
   - All intermediate distances \(2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2(n-2)\) are also covered.

5. Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all odd and even numbers from 1 to \(2(n-1)\), ensuring the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(2n-1\).

Given that the program correctly generates the required coordinates to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any \(n\) within the specified range, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
