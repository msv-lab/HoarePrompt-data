Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, for \( n > 2 \), the program only prints two points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) and then a series of points \((i, i)\) from \(3\) to \(n\). This approach does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, consider \( n = 3 \). The optimal arrangement, as described in the problem note, includes the points \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\). However, the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
This arrangement does not include the points \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\), resulting in a smaller set \(\mathcal{H}\).

Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \geq 3 \), making it incorrect.
