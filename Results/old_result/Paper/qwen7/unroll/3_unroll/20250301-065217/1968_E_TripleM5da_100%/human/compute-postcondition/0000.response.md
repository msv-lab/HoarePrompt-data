Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - The value of `i` is determined by `int(input())`, which means the user will input an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is given as an initial state and does not directly affect the loop's execution (the loop's execution depends on the user input), we don't need to adjust `t`.
   - We need to ensure that the user inputs a value for `int(input())` that allows the loop to execute at least once. Given the constraints, the minimum value for `int(input())` should be 2 (since \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\)).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the user inputs a value for `int(input())` that is at least 2.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- The user must input an integer for `int(input())` that is at least 2.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), the user must input an integer for `int(input())` that is at least 2**.
