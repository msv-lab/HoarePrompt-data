Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the string but does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the `func_1` function is trying to create a mapping from characters in the alphabet to characters in the encoded string, which is not what is required for decoding. Instead, we need to reverse the process of encoding as described in the problem statement.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        
        # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
        r = sorted(set(encoded))
        
        # Step 2: Create a mapping from r to its symmetric characters
        mapping = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
        
        # Step 3: Decode the string
        decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
        
        print(decoded)
```

This corrected program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct letters of the encoded string in alphabetical order. Then it creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character. Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding symmetric character from the mapping.
