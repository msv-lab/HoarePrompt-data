#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that encoded is the result of encoding some string s according to the given algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: Output State: `mapping` is a dictionary where each letter from 'a' to 'z' maps to a unique character from the `encoded` string, and `decoded` is a list containing the decoded characters based on the mappings created.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that is formed by joining all characters in the list 'decoded' based on the mappings created in the dictionary 'mapping'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. It creates a mapping of each letter from 'a' to 'z' to a unique character from the `encoded` string. If a character is repeated in `encoded`, it uses the previously mapped character. If a new character is encountered, it assigns it a unique character from 'a' to 'z' that hasn't been used yet. The function then constructs and returns the decoded string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding mapped character.
