Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in each test case.
   - It iterates through each element in the array `arr` and calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` for each element.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of how many times each `(rx, ry)` pair appears.
   - If a pair `(rx, ry)` already exists in the dictionary, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly reads the input from standard input and organizes it into a format suitable for processing by `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It constructs a list of tuples `test_cases` containing the necessary information for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and stores the results.
   - It then prints the results for each test case, which are the counts of beautiful pairs calculated by `func_1`.

Given the problem description and the provided annotations, both functions together correctly implement the required functionality. They handle the input, process it according to the rules defined in the problem statement, and produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
