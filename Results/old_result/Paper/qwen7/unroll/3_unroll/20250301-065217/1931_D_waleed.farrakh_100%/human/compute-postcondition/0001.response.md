Output State: **`data` is a list containing the lines from `input().splitlines()`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers for each test case such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the list, and the length of `arr` is n; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `data = input().splitlines()` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines, storing these lines in the list `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
