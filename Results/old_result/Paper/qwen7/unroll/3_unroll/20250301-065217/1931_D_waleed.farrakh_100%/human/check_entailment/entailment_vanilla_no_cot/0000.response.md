Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The `func_2` function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases. It correctly parses the input and passes the test cases to `func_1`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: In `func_1`, the program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` for each element in the array. This helps in efficiently counting the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Pair Counting Logic**: For each element `a` in the array, the program calculates `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`. These calculations ensure that the values are within the valid range for modulo operations. The program then checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it adds the count of such pairs to the total count. Finally, it updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the problem description and the example provided, the implementation appears to be correct and handles all the specified requirements.
