### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summaries.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary used to store the frequency of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs.
   - `count` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, compute `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This computes the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`. The expression ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This computes the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - Check if the tuple `(rx, ry)` exists in the `freq` dictionary:
     - If it exists, add the value of `freq[rx, ry]` to `count`.
   - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

3. **Return the results**:
   - Append the final `count` to the `results` list and return it.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the entire input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Splits the input into lines.
   - Extracts the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Iterates over each test case, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Appends the test case to the `test_cases` list in the format `(n, x, y, arr)`.

3. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and stores the results.

4. **Printing Results**:
   - Iterates over the results and prints each one.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation `(-a % x + x) % x` correctly handles negative remainders, ensuring `rx` is always non-negative.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct. It checks if the required conditions for a beautiful pair are met by leveraging the remainders.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The use of a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of pairs is appropriate and efficient.

4. **Input Reading**:
   - The input reading mechanism in `func_2` is correct and handles the large input sizes efficiently.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic in both functions is sound and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Validation Using Function Summaries

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function processes each test case and returns the count of beautiful pairs.
  - The logic inside `func_1` is consistent with the problem requirements.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads the input correctly and processes it using `func_1`.
  - Prints the results correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the problem description and function summaries, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the given problem statement.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
