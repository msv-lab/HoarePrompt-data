Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`, which is used as an argument in the `range()` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem states that `idx` is 1 before the loop starts. However, `idx` is not involved in the loop head, so its value does not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 (since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`). If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
