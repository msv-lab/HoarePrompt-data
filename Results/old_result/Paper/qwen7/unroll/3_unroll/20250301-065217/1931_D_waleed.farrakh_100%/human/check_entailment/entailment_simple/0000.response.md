Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads input from stdin and processes it to extract test cases.
   - Each test case consists of `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`.
   - Stores these in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Takes the list of test cases as input.
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of beautiful pairs using the given conditions.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of pairs `(rx, ry)` where:
     - \( rx = (-a \% x + x) \% x \)
     - \( ry = a \% y \)
   - If a pair `(rx, ry)` appears more than once, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in both functions seems correct and follows the problem statement.
   - `func_2()` correctly parses the input and passes it to `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.
   - The output is printed in the correct format.

Given the detailed explanation and the logical flow of the code, there are no apparent errors in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
