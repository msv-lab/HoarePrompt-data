You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged, and the output consists of pairs of integers printed based on the condition in the loop. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `x-1`, the program reads two integers `x` and `y` from input. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` and `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` and `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9, but these values are not directly passed as parameters to the function. Instead, the function returns different outputs based on the value of `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
