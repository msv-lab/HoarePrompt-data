Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `x` for each case.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - `y = n + x` is calculated, which is necessary for determining the possible values of `k`.

3. **Checking Parity of `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, no valid `k` can exist since `2k - 2` must be even.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`, and if true, it adds the result of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - `L1` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - This function is used to find valid `k` values.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Divisor Calculation:**
  - The function correctly identifies all divisors of the input `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - It uses a loop to check for divisors from `1` to `int(w // 1)`, where `w` is the square root of `q`.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case when `y` is odd correctly by printing `0`.
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies valid `k` values by checking divisors.

- **Logic Flow:**
  - The logic flow is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

- **Output:**
  - The output matches the expected results provided in the example.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
