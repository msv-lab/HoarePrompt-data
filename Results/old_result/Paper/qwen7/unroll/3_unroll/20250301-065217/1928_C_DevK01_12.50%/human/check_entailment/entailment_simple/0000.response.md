Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible values of \( k \) that satisfy the given conditions based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \).

2. **Key Points**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The formula \( y = n + x \) is used to derive the potential values of \( k \).
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all valid \( k \) values that fit the criteria.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function takes \( q \) and \( x \) as inputs.
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If true, it adds the integer part of the square root to the list \( M \).
   - It then iterates through the range from 1 to the integer part of the square root of \( q \), checking if \( q \) is divisible by \( i \) and if either \( i \) or \( q // i \) is greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If true, it adds those values to the list \( M \).

4. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even. If not, it prints 0 and continues.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It handles the case where \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) by calling `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It ensures the results are unique by converting the list to a set before calculating its length.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies valid \( k \) values by checking the conditions and adding them to the list.
   - The main program correctly processes each test case and handles the edge cases appropriately.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
