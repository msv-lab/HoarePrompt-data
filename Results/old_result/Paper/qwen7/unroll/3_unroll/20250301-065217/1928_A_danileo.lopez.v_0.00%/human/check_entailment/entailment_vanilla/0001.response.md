Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, reading pairs of integers `(a, b)` for each test case.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, the program checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If the condition is false, it prints 'No'.

3. **Problem Description Understanding:**
   - According to the problem, Bob can form another rectangle if the original rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - Specifically, if either dimension of the original rectangle is even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting along that dimension and rearranging the pieces.

### Verification of the Program:

- **Case 1: Both dimensions are odd (`a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`).**
  - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program correctly prints 'No' because neither dimension allows for a clean division into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a new rectangle.
  
- **Case 2: At least one dimension is even (`a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`).**
  - If either `a` or `b` is even, the program correctly prints 'Yes' because the rectangle can be cut along the even dimension, and the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Examples from the Problem Statement:

- **Test Case 1:** `1 1`
  - Both dimensions are 1 (odd), so the program prints 'No'.
- **Test Case 2:** `2 1`
  - One dimension is 2 (even), so the program prints 'Yes'.
- **Test Case 3:** `2 6`
  - One dimension is 2 (even), so the program prints 'Yes'.
- **Test Case 4:** `3 2`
  - One dimension is 2 (even), so the program prints 'Yes'.
- **Test Case 5:** `2 2`
  - Both dimensions are 2 (even), so the program prints 'Yes'.
- **Test Case 6:** `2 4`
  - Both dimensions are even, but the program still prints 'Yes' because at least one dimension is even.
- **Test Case 7:** `6 3`
  - One dimension is 6 (even), so the program prints 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even and prints 'Yes' if so, indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
