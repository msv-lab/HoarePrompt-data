### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - A rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles if at least one of its dimensions is even.
   - From the resulting smaller rectangles, a new rectangle can be formed if the dimensions allow it.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.

2. **Given Code**:
   ```python
   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
           if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
               print('Yes')
           else:
               print('No')
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers, `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
   - If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'No'.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where both dimensions are odd.
   - A counterexample given is `3 3`, where the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' but should print 'No'.

5. **Evaluation Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the program.
   - The program indeed checks if either dimension is even and prints 'Yes' if so.
   - The program prints 'No' only if both dimensions are odd.
   - The annotated code matches the problem requirements and the behavior of the program.

6. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the logic with some examples:
     - For `3 3`: Both dimensions are odd, so the program prints 'No'.
     - For `2 3`: One dimension is even, so the program prints 'Yes'.
     - For `4 5`: One dimension is even, so the program prints 'Yes'.
     - For `1 1`: Both dimensions are odd, so the program prints 'No'.
   - These examples align with the problem statement and the annotated code.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the cases where at least one dimension is even and prints 'Yes'. It also correctly handles the cases where both dimensions are odd and prints 'No'. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem.

**Final: True**
