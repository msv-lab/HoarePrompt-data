Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the output state remains consistent with this condition. The other variables (`a` and `b`) are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by this code, so they retain their unspecified positive integer values within the given range.
