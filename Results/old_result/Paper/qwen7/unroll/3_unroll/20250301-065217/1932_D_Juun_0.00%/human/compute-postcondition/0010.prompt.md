Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards with the same suit as `trump`, `t` is the number of unique ranks in `trumps`, `n` is the number of unique suits in `input()`, `trump` is the string representing the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings of sorted rank-suit pairs for each suit that had a previously assigned rank, `suits` is a dictionary where each key ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') maps to None if no new rank was assigned to that suit during the loop, or to the highest rank assigned to that suit if a new rank was assigned.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
