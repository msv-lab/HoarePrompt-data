Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and `trump` is the input string representing the trump suit.**

The code initializes an empty list `trumps`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `trump` remain unchanged from their initial states.
