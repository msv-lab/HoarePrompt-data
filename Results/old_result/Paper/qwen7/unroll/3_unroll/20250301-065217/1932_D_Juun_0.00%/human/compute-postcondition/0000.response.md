Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains 2n unique cards, each described by a two-character string where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS"); input() is executed.**

Explanation: The `input()` function reads input from the user but does not store it in any variable. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged. The third line of each test case containing 2n unique cards also remains unchanged. The `input()` function itself is executed but does not modify any existing variables.
