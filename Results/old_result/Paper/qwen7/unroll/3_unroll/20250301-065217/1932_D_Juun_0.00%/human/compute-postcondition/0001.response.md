Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and `trump` is the input string representing the trump suit.**

Explanation: The variable `trump` is assigned the value of the input string, which represents the trump suit. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that the trump suit is one of "CDHS" is still valid.
