Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, if cntl[0] is not zero, then c is set to the minimum of 2 and cntl[0], and the loop checks if cntl[j] is less than 2 for each j from 1 to n. If cntl[j] is less than 2, c is decremented. The loop prints j when c becomes 0 or when j equals n.
