### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks the conditions for `x` relative to `k - 1`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`:
       - It calculates `z` using a loop where `z` is incremented based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations.
       - It checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - For `x < k - 1`:
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times in a row, plus one additional bet to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can always bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again.
   - For `x == k - 1`:
     - The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times in a row and then winning twice to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again, and the recovery is possible within the constraints.
   - For `x > k - 1`:
     - The calculation of `z` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then recovering.
     - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` correctly models the growth of Sasha's coins after each loss and subsequent win.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is less than `k - 1` and `x` equals `k - 1` correctly.
   - The loop for `x > k - 1` correctly calculates the required number of coins `z` to ensure Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
  - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times in a row and then betting 1 coin to recover. This is correct because Sasha can always bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again.

- **Case 2: \( x == k - 1 \)**
  - The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times in a row and then winning twice to recover. This is correct because Sasha can bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again, and the recovery is possible within the constraints.

- **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
  - The calculation of `z` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then recovering. The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` correctly models the growth of Sasha's coins after each loss and subsequent win. This is correct because it accounts for the exponential growth of Sasha's coins due to the promotion rule.

### Conclusion:

After re-evaluating the program, we confirm that the logic and conditions are correctly implemented to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints. The program handles all specified scenarios accurately.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
