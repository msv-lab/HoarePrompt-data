Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Sasha can achieve his goal is flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`

According to the problem description, Sasha can only place a bet of 1 coin initially because he cannot lose more than 1 time in a row. However, if he loses, he will not be able to place any more bets since he will have 0 coins left. This means he cannot guarantee having as many coins as he wants, even though the program incorrectly outputs "YES".

To fix this, the program needs to consider the scenario where Sasha loses the first bet and cannot place any more bets. The current logic does not account for this situation properly.
