You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    4 88 1000000000
    
    25 69 231
    
    13 97 18806

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided within the loop. Specifically, it will depend on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` entered during each iteration, with `t` indicating the number of iterations. Each line of output will either be 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the conditions in the loop are met for the given inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of inputs (t, k, x, a) where t is the number of iterations, k and x are integers, and a is a large integer. For each iteration, it checks specific conditions involving k, x, and a. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program consists of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs for each iteration, based on the evaluated conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks the conditions for `x` relative to `k - 1`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`:
       - It calculates `z` using a loop where `z` is incremented based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations.
       - It checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - For `x < k - 1`: 
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times in a row, plus one additional bet to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can always bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again.
   - For `x == k - 1`:
     - The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times in a row and then winning twice to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again, and the recovery is possible within the constraints.
   - For `x > k - 1`:
     - The calculation of `z` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then recovering.
     - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` correctly models the growth of Sasha's coins after each loss and subsequent win.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is less than `k - 1` and `x` equals `k - 1` correctly.
   - The loop for `x > k - 1` correctly calculates the required number of coins `z` to ensure Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints. The conditions and calculations are accurate and handle all specified scenarios.
