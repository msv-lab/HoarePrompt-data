Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee having any number of coins `n` given the constraints of the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
   - If Sasha can lose no more than `x` times in a row and `x` is less than `k - 1`, then Sasha can always recover from a series of losses because the multiplier `k` allows him to regain more coins after each win. As long as he starts with at least `x + 1` coins, he can ensure he doesn't run out of coins before winning again.
   
2. **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
   - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, then he needs at least `x + 3` coins to ensure he can recover after a series of losses. This is because after losing `k - 1` times, he needs to win once to get back into a position where he can continue betting without running out of coins.
   
3. **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
   - If Sasha can lose more than `k - 1` times in a row, then he needs to calculate how many coins he would need to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row. The code calculates `z` as the sum of the series where each term is the sum of the previous term divided by `(k - 1)` plus one. This ensures that even if Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he can still recover and continue betting.

The solution correctly handles all these cases and prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee having any number of coins `n`, and 'NO' otherwise. Thus, the provided program is correct.
