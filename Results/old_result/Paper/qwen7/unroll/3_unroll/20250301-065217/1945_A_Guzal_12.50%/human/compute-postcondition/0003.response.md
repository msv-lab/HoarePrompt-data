Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration of the loop, the variable `k` accumulates based on the conditions provided. Specifically, `k` is incremented by `a + (b + c) // 3`, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, an additional 1 is added to `k`. If any input does not meet the specified conditions, `-1` is printed instead of updating `k`. After all iterations, the final value of `k` is the sum of all valid updates across the iterations.
