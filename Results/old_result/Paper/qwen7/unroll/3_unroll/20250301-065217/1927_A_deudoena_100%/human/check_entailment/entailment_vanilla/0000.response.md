### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that, when painted white, will make all cells in the strip white.
   - This means we need to find the shortest segment that includes the first black cell ('B') and the last black cell ('B').

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and prints its result.
   - `func_1()` is supposed to calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

3. **Analyzing `func_1()`**:
   - `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0.
   - `m` is the length of the strip, read from input.
   - `s` is the string representing the strip, read from input.
   - `c` and `d` are counters initialized to 0.
   - `l` is an empty list (not used in the function, so it can be ignored).
   - The first loop finds the index of the first black cell ('B') and sets `mi` to `c + 1` (index starting from 1).
   - The second loop finds the index of the last black cell ('B') from the end and sets `ma` to `len(s) - d`.
   - The function returns `ma - mi + 2`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic to find the first black cell and the last black cell is correct.
   - However, the formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. It should be `ma - mi + 1` because the length of the segment is the difference between the indices plus one.
   - Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are no black cells, which is not possible according to the problem statement but is worth noting.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but the formula for calculating the segment length is incorrect. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results in all cases.

**Correctness: **False**
