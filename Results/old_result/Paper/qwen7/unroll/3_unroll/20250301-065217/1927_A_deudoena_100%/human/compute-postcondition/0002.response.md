Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B', `m` is an input integer, `s` is updated to the input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables (`ma`, `mi`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged. The string `s` is updated to the new input value.
