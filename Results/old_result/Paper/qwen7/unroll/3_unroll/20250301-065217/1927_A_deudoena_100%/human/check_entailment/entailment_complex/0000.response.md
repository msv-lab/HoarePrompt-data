Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white.
2. The annotated program has several issues:
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The function only considers the first and last occurrences of 'B' but does not account for the possibility that there might be multiple segments of 'B's within the string.
   - The function incorrectly calculates the distance and adds 2, which does not reflect the actual minimum segment length needed.
3. To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the longest sequence of consecutive 'W's (white cells) and calculate the length of the segment starting from the beginning of the first 'B' to the end of the last 'B' in the string.
4. The provided solution does not handle these cases correctly and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
