You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1

            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The console will display "NO" for each input value of `t` where the input value is 1, and "YES" followed by a string `ans` constructed based on the input value `n`. The string `ans` will be composed of characters from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' according to the rules defined in the loop. Each iteration of the outer loop (`for i in range(t)`) will reset the variables `n`, `ans`, and `x` to their initial states.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `os.system('cls')` to clear the console, which is not necessary for solving the problem and can be ignored.
   - It imports `string` and defines a function `func()`.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Character Counting Logic:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program prints "NO" because a string with exactly one special character cannot be formed with a single character.
   - Otherwise, it attempts to construct a string with `n` special characters.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` and a counter `x` starting from 0.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating pairs of different characters from the uppercase alphabet.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then continues to repeat pairs of different characters from the uppercase alphabet.

4. **Checking Special Characters:**
   - The logic for constructing the string does not explicitly check if the constructed string has exactly `n` special characters. Instead, it relies on the structure of the string to ensure that each character (except the first and last) is special.

### Testing the Logic:

- **Case 1: `n = 6`**
  - The program constructs the string "AAABAACC".
  - This string has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8), so it is correct.

- **Case 2: `n = 1`**
  - The program prints "NO", which is correct since a single character cannot have a special character.

- **Case 3: `n = 2`**
  - The program constructs the string "MM".
  - This string has 2 special characters (positions 1 and 2), so it is correct.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case 4: `n = 5`**
  - The program constructs the string "AAABA".
  - This string has 3 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5), which is incorrect since we need exactly 5 special characters.
  - The program should handle this case differently.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not guarantee that the constructed string will always have exactly `n` special characters. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
