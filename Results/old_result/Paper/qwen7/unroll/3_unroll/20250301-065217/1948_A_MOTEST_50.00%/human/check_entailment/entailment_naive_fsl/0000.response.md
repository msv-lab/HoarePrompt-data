Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is odd and greater than 1. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd and greater than 1, we need to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters. However, the current implementation fails to generate such a string correctly.

For example, consider `n = 3`. The program generates 'AAA' which has 2 special characters (positions 2 and 3), but it should have 3 special characters. The correct output for `n = 3` should be a string like 'AABAC' where all three characters are special.

Here is a modified version of the program that correctly handles all cases:

```python
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                # Generate a string with (n-1)/2 pairs and one additional character
                for j in range((n - 1) // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
                ans += s[x]
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for odd `n`, the string generated will have exactly `n` special characters.
