### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly initializes by clearing the screen using `os.system('cls')`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Special Character Calculation:**
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.
   - The program checks if `n` is 1. If so, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have a string with exactly one special character (since a single character cannot be special as it has no neighbors).

3. **String Construction:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program constructs a string `ans` with the required number of special characters.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating pairs of different characters from the set of uppercase Latin letters.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then constructs the rest of the string similarly.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string `ans`.
   - The length of the constructed string is always within the limit of 200 characters, as specified in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing "NO".
   - The construction logic ensures that the string meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to construct a string with the specified number of special characters or reports that no such string exists. The output format and constraints are also handled appropriately.

### Correctness:

**True**
