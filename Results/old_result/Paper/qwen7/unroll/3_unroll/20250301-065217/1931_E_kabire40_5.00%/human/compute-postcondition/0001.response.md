Output State: Sasha or Anna is printed based on the condition that if the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than \(10^{max\_power}\), then "Sasha" is printed, otherwise "Anna" is printed. The exact output depends on the specific values of `list_len`, `max_power`, and the contents of `operational_list` for each test case.
