Output State: The output state will consist of two indices, `mak2` and `mak`. `mak2` is the final value of `mak` from the first iteration of the loop, and `mak` is the final value of `mak` from the last iteration of the loop where the final comparison is made among elements in the list `pans`.

To understand this, let's break down the loop:

1. In the first part of the loop, `mak` is updated based on comparisons between `mak` and other indices from 1 to `n-1`.
2. In the second part, `mak2` is initialized to `mak`, and `pans` is populated based on further comparisons involving `mak2` and all indices from 0 to `n-1`.
3. In the third part, `mak` is updated based on comparisons within `pans`.
4. Finally, the loop prints the pair `(mak2, mak)`.

Since the exact permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) is not known, the output state depends on the outcomes of the comparisons made during the loop. However, the final values of `mak2` and `mak` are determined by these comparisons and will be the result of the loop's execution.
