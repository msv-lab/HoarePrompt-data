### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Length Check**: It correctly reads the length `n` of the strings for each test case.
3. **String Input**: The program correctly reads the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. **Template Validation Logic**:
   - The program checks each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. If `c[i]` is different, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, it allows `c[i]` to be either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, continuing to the next character without setting `possible` to `True`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` is neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`), it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
5. **Output**: Based on the value of `possible`, it prints "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for determining if a template exists that matches `a` and `b` but not `c` is sound.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
