Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in determining whether a template `t` exists that satisfies the conditions for strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, the logic for checking if a template is possible is incorrect.

Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining `possible`:**
   - The current logic checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, and if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If this condition holds, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic does not correctly handle the requirement that both `a` and `b` should match the template, while `c` should not.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each position `i`, we need to ensure that either:
     - Both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`, or
     - One of `a[i]` or `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`, but the other is the same as `c[i]`.

3. **Revised Program:**
   Hereâ€™s a revised version of the program that correctly implements the logic:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if a[i] == c[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
            else:
                if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

This revised program correctly checks if there exists a template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.
