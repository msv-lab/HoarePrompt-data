State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `w` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `w`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
- For the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `t` is not directly involved in determining whether the loop should execute or not, so it does not need to be adjusted in this context.
