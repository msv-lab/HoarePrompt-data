The function processes multiple lists of integers, each list containing between 1 and 100 integers (inclusive), where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For each list, it counts the number of groups of three or more occurrences of each unique integer and sums these counts. Finally, it prints the total count of such groups across all processed lists.
