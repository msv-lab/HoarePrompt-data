You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an integer representing the number of iterations of the loop, `shapes` is the sum of the number of groups of three or more occurrences of each unique integer in the input lists across all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple lists of integers, each list containing between 1 and 100 integers (inclusive), where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For each list, it counts the number of groups of three or more occurrences of each unique integer and sums these counts. Finally, it prints the total count of such groups across all processed lists.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple polygons can be formed using different sets of sticks. For example, consider the input:

```
4
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```

According to the problem description, we can form a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4. However, the program only counts the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using the maximum number of sides available for any single polygon type. In this case, the program would only count the squares (since there are more 4's than 2's), resulting in an output of 2 instead of the correct output of 2 (one pentagon and one square).

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible combinations of polygons that can be formed and choose the maximum number of polygons that can be constructed simultaneously.
