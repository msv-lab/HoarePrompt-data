Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks and then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Data Structure Initialization:**
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is initialized to store unique stick lengths.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program iterates over each stick length in `palka`.
   - It updates the count of each stick length in the dictionary `d`.
   - It also ensures that each unique stick length is added to the list `pl`.

4. **Calculating Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - The variable `shapes` is initialized to zero.
   - The program iterates over each unique stick length in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons (triangles, squares, etc.) can be formed using the available sticks of that length.
   - The number of polygons is calculated as `d[j] // 3`, where `j` is the current unique stick length.
   - This value is added to `shapes`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all unique stick lengths, the total number of polygons `shapes` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `w` times.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The dictionary `d` correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length.
   - The list `pl` stores unique stick lengths, ensuring no stick length is counted multiple times in the polygon calculation.

3. **Polygon Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon needs at least 3 sides).
   - This calculation is correct for forming triangles, squares, pentagons, etc., as long as the stick lengths are sufficient.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct number of polygons for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. It handles multiple test cases, counts stick lengths accurately, and calculates the number of polygons correctly.

**Correctness: **True**
