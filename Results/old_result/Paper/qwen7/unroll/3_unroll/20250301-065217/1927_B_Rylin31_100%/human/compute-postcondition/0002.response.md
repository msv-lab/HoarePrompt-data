Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, l is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 2⋅10^5; s is a list of l integers initialized to 0; array is a list of l integers read from input; ans is a string; after executing the loop, ans is constructed by iterating over array, appending the character corresponding to the value of s[j] + 97, and then incrementing s[j] by 1 for each j in array.
