The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, initializes a list `s` of length `l` with zeros, reads a list of integers `array` of length `l`, and constructs a string `ans` by converting each integer in `array` to a corresponding character based on the value of `s[j] + 97`. After processing each integer in `array`, it increments the corresponding value in `s`. Finally, it prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.
