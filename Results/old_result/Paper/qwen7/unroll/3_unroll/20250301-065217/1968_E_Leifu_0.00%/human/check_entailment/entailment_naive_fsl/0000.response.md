Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For instance, consider \(n = 4\). The program outputs the following coordinates:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
3 3
```
However, a better arrangement to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) would be:
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
This arrangement results in the following Manhattan distances:
\[
\{0, 2, 3, 4\}
\]
which has a size of 4. The given program only achieves a size of 3 with the current output. Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\), making it incorrect.
