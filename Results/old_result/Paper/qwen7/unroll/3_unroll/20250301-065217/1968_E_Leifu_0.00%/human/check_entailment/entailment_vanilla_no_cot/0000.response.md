Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program hardcodes some coordinates without considering the general case for larger \(n\). For example, when \(n = 3\), the program outputs coordinates that do not maximize the Manhattan distances. Additionally, for \(n > 3\), the approach used does not ensure the maximum number of unique Manhattan distances.

A correct solution would need to consider a more general strategy to place points such that the number of unique Manhattan distances is maximized, as demonstrated in the problem's examples.
