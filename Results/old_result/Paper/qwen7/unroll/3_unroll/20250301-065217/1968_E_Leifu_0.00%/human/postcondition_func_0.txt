The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \), where \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \). For each test case, it prints a specific sequence of numbers. Specifically, it prints "1 1", "1 2", followed by either "2 3" or "2 4" depending on whether \( n \) is 3 or not. If \( n \) is greater than 3, it also prints numbers from 4 to \( n \) inclusive. After processing all test cases, it outputs \( t \) lines of these sequences, corresponding to each test case.
