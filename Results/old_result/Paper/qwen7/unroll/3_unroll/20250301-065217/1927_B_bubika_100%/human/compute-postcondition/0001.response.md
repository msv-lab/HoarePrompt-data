Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `t` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the initial value of `t`**: The initial value of `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Consider the input**: The value of `t` is determined by the input from the user. Therefore, the initial value of `t` must be such that it satisfies the loop condition.

Given these points, the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `t`, and it must be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (since it is a positive integer and the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0).

Therefore, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
