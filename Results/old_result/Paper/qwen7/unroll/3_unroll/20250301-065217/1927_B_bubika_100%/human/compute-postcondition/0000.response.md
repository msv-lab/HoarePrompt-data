Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < n; a is a string containing 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. The values of `t` and `n` along with the list of integers are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, they remain as per their initial state.
