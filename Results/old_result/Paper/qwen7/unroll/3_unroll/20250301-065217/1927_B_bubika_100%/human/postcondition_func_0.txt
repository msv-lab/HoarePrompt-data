The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \). It then maps each integer in the list to a corresponding character in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' based on the index found in a temporary list \( b \), which keeps track of the counts of each index used. The function constructs and prints a string \( r \) consisting of these characters. After processing all test cases, it outputs the constructed strings for each case.
