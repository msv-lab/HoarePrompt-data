Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

# Annotated Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the value of `best_y` found for each `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x`, `best_y` is the largest integer less than `x` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` itself is maximized.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each element corresponds to the largest integer less than the respective x in test_cases such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and best_y plus best_y itself is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t` (though `t` is not used in the function), a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers each between 2 and 1000. For each element in `test_cases`, the function computes and returns a list where each element is the largest integer less than the respective element in `test_cases` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the element in `test_cases` and the computed element plus the computed element itself is maximized.
