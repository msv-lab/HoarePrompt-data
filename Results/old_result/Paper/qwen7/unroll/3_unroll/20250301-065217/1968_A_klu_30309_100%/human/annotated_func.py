#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the value of `best_y` found for each `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x`, `best_y` is the largest integer less than `x` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` itself is maximized.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each element corresponds to the largest integer less than the respective x in test_cases such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and best_y plus best_y itself is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t` (though `t` is not used in the function), a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers each between 2 and 1000. For each element in `test_cases`, the function computes and returns a list where each element is the largest integer less than the respective element in `test_cases` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the element in `test_cases` and the computed element plus the computed element itself is maximized.
