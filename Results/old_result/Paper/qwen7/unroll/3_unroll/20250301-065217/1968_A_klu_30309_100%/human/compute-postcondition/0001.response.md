Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `x`: This is the variable that iterates over the elements in `test_cases`.
   - `test_cases`: This is the list that contains the values for `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The value of `x` will change in each iteration, but initially, `x` is not defined because the loop hasn't started yet.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is not defined at the start of the loop, we don't need to adjust its initial state.
   - We need to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty, as this is the condition that allows the loop to start executing.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `test_cases` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` must have at least one element**.
