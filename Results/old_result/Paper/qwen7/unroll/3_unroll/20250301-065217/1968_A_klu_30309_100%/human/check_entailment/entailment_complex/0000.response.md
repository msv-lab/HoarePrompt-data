Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) for each given \( x \) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) plus \( y \) is maximized.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to achieve this:
   - It iterates over all possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1 for each \( x \).
   - It calculates the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - It checks if the current sum (GCD + \( y \)) is greater than the previously recorded maximum sum.
   - If it is, it updates the maximum sum and records the corresponding \( y \).
   - This process ensures that the program finds the optimal \( y \) for each \( x \).
3. The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through the list of test cases and applying the same logic to each one.
4. The final results are stored in a list and returned, which matches the required output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
