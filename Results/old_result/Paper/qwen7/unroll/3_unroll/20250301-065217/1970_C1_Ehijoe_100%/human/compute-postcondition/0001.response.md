Output State: **`t` is the integer input value, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, and `n` is the integer input value; `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, and `n` are updated to the integer input values provided. The other variables remain unchanged, and the new list `edges` is created and initialized as an empty list.
