Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program expects the number of test cases `n` but only processes one test case. It should process multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside the loop to check if the current friend and their best friend can be invited together is flawed. It uses `flag` incorrectly and breaks out of the loop prematurely. Additionally, it prints `2` if any pair of friends can invite each other, which is not always the optimal solution.

3. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**: The program attempts to print `2` if any pair of friends can invite each other, but this might not be the minimum number of invitations required. It also tries to print `3` if no such pairs exist, which is not always correct either.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify cycles in the friendship graph.
- Determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Create a graph where each node points to its best friend
        graph = {i + 1: p[i] for i in range(n)}
        
        # Function to find the cycle length starting from node `start`
        def find_cycle_length(start):
            visited = set()
            current = start
            length = 0
            while current not in visited:
                visited.add(current)
                current = graph[current]
                length += 1
            return length
        
        # Find all cycles in the graph
        cycles = []
        visited = set()
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i not in visited:
                cycle_length = find_cycle_length(i)
                if cycle_length > 0:
                    cycles.append(cycle_length)
                    visited.update(range(i, i + cycle_length))
        
        # If there are no cycles, the minimum number of invitations is 3
        if not cycles:
            print(3)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of invitations
            min_invitations = float('inf')
            for cycle in cycles:
                if cycle >= 2:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 2)
                else:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle)
            print(min_invitations)

func()
```

This corrected program properly handles multiple test cases and calculates the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
