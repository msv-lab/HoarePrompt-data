Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The program checks if there exists an index \( i \) such that \( p[p_i - 1] == p_i - 1 \). If such an index exists, it prints "2", indicating that only two friends need to be invited (the pair who are each other's best friends). Otherwise, it prints "3", which is incorrect.
- According to the problem, Monocarp needs to invite enough friends so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The logic in the provided program fails to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party when no such pair exists. Instead, it incorrectly prints "3" in cases where more than just a single pair might be able to attend with fewer invitations.
- For instance, consider the example where \( p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] \). The program would incorrectly print "3" because no \( p_i \) satisfies \( p[p_i - 1] == p_i - 1 \). However, inviting friends 4 and 5 would suffice, as explained in the problem statement, and the program should print "2".
- The program should instead find the minimum number of friends to invite such that at least 2 friends come to the party. This involves checking for cycles and ensuring that the invitations cover at least one cycle of length 2 or more.

Correctness: **False**
