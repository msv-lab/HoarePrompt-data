Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array `nums` and stores their start and end indices along with the element value.
2. For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment within the specified range `[l, r]`.
3. The logic for determining the valid segment and printing the indices is correct:
   - If the start index `s` of the segment is greater than `l`, it checks further conditions to determine if a valid segment exists.
   - If the end index `e` of the segment is less than `r`, it prints the indices of the start and end of the segment.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1 -1`.

Given the provided execution summary and the detailed analysis of the code, the program appears to be functioning as intended based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
