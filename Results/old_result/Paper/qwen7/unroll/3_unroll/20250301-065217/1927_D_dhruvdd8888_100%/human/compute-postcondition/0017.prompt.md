You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())` with an additional element `-1` appended to it; `s` is an integer representing the start index of segments where elements in `nums` are the same; `e` is an integer representing the end index of segments where elements in `nums` are the same; `num` is the current element being compared in `nums`; `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: the start index (`1 + s`), the end index (`i`), and the value of `num` for each segment of consecutive identical elements in `nums`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the loop iterations. For each iteration, the loop processes two integers `l` and `r` from the input, finds a segment in the array `arr` based on these values, and prints either a segment or `-1 -1` based on certain conditions. After all iterations, the output state will consist of a series of segments printed for each valid input pair `(l, r)`, or `-1 -1` if no valid segment is found.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5), a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6), and q (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5). Additionally, each query is represented by two integers l and r (where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The function processes q queries, each defined by l and r, and returns the result based on the specified conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
