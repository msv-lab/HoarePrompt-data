You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries. It first identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in `nums` and stores their start and end indices along with the value of the elements. Then, for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it determines whether a valid segment exists within the specified range and prints the start and end indices of that segment, or `-1 -1` if no valid segment is found.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads `N`, the size of the array.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and appends `-1` at the end to handle boundary conditions easily.
   - It reads the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program uses a list `arr` to store intervals where the value of `nums` changes.
   - It iterates through the array and whenever it encounters a different value, it adds the interval to `arr`.
   - This ensures that `arr` contains intervals where the value of `nums` remains constant.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program finds the relevant interval in `arr` using binary search (`bisect_left`).
   - It checks if the start of the interval is within the query bounds. If so, it prints the indices of the start and one position after the start.
   - If the end of the interval is within the query bounds, it prints the indices of the start and end of the interval.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Interval Construction:**
   - The interval construction logic seems correct. It correctly identifies segments where the array values are the same.
   
2. **Query Handling:**
   - The query handling logic is also correct. It uses binary search to find the relevant segment and then checks if the segment boundaries fall within the query range.
   - The logic for printing the result based on the segment boundaries is correct.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when the start of the interval is greater than `l` or when the end of the interval is less than `r` correctly.
   - The program also handles cases where no valid pair exists by printing `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or missing parts.
