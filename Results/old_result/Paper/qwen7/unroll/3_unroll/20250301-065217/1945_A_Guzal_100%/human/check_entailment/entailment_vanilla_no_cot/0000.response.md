Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Handling of Extroverts and Universals**: The logic to handle the placement of extroverts and universals is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:` does not correctly determine whether it's possible to place all extroverts and universals. This condition should check if the remaining universals can accommodate the remaining extroverts properly.

2. **Calculation of Tents**: The calculation of the number of tents required needs to be more precise. The current logic might not account for the exact distribution of participants into tents.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        
        # All introverts need individual tents
        k += a
        
        # Calculate the number of full tents for extroverts and universals
        full_tents = b // 3
        k += full_tents
        
        # Remaining extroverts and universals
        remaining_extroverts = b % 3
        remaining_universals = c
        
        # Check if we can place the remaining extroverts and universals
        if remaining_extroverts == 1:
            if remaining_universals >= 2:
                remaining_universals -= 2
                k += 1
            elif remaining_universals == 1:
                print(-1)
                continue
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        elif remaining_extroverts == 2:
            if remaining_universals >= 1:
                remaining_universals -= 1
                k += 1
            elif remaining_universals == 0:
                print(-1)
                continue
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
        # Add the remaining universals to the count
        k += remaining_universals // 3
        if remaining_universals % 3 != 0:
            k += 1
        
        print(k)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required while respecting the constraints and conditions provided in the problem statement.
