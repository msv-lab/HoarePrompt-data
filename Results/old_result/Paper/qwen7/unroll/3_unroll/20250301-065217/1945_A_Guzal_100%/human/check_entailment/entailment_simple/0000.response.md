Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
3. The logic to calculate the number of tents is as follows:
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent, contributing `a` tents.
   - Extroverts prefer to live in groups of three, but if the remaining people after placing introverts cannot form complete groups of three, it checks if the remaining people can still form a group with universals.
   - Universals can adapt to any situation, so they can fill in the gaps.
4. The condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:` ensures that if the remaining extroverts cannot form a complete group of three even with the help of universals, the program prints `-1`.
5. The calculation `k += a + (b + c) // 3` accounts for the introverts and the maximum number of complete groups of three that can be formed from extroverts and universals.
6. If there are leftover people after forming complete groups of three, an additional tent is required, which is handled by `if (b + c) % 3 != 0: k += 1`.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
