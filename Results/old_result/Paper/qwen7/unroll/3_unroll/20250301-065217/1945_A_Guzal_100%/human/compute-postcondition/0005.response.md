Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates a value `k` based on specific conditions involving these integers. If any test case fails a particular condition, the function prints -1 and terminates. Otherwise, it prints the calculated value `k` for each test case after processing all cases.**
