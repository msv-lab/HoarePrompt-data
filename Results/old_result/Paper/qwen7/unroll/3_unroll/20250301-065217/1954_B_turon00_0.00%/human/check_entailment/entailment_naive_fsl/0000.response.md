Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer than `ans` elements. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**: The program calculates `cnt` as the consecutive count of elements equal to `tmp`. However, it does not account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing fewer elements than the current `ans`.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
   - The program outputs `1`, but the correct answer should be `1` because removing the element at index 2 (value 2) makes the array `[1, 1, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful anymore.
   - Another example:
     ```
     7
     3 3 3 5 3 3 3
     ```
   - The program outputs `3`, but the correct answer should be `3` because removing the first three elements `[3, 3, 3]` makes the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful anymore.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves identifying the longest subarray where all elements are the same and then calculating the minimum number of removals needed to break this subarray.
   - For each unique value in the array, find the longest subarray of that value and calculate the number of removals needed to break it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        max_length = 0
        current_length = 1
        prev_value = a[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == prev_value:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
                current_length = 1
            prev_value = a[i]
        
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the longest subarray of identical elements and calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break it, ensuring the array is no longer beautiful.
