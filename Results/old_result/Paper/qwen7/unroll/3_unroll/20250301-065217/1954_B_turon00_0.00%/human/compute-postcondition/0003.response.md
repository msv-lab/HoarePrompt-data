Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function processes these inputs and produces a result for each test case without needing any additional parameters outside of the test case data itself.
