The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the minimum count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of the list. If all elements in the list are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
