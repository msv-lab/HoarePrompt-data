Output State: **t is the number of test cases, and for each test case, the output is either -1 or the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element in the list a, with -1 printed if all elements in the list a are the same.**

This means that for each input integer `t`, the code will process `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. If all elements in `a` are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the list and prints this value.
