Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a`. This is stored in the list `S`.
   - It then iterates through each possible position `i` to find the optimal position that satisfies the conditions:
     - At least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
     - At least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - The function also ensures that the chosen position `i` minimizes the absolute difference from the center of the village (`abs(n / 2 - i)`).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function ensures that the state of the program remains consistent across different test cases.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It processes each test case independently and correctly identifies the optimal position for the road.
   - The program adheres to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
