Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied.
2. The solution involves calculating the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a`.
3. Function `func_1` correctly computes these cumulative counts and checks for the optimal position `i` by iterating through all possible positions.
4. Function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Given the execution summaries and the code provided, both functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
