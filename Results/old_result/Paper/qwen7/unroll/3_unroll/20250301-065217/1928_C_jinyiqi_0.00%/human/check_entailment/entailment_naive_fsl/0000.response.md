Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but the logic to determine the valid `k` values is flawed.

Hereâ€™s a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`. According to the problem description, the valid `k` values should be 2, 3, 5, and 6. However, the program does not correctly compute these values.

Let's analyze the steps:
1. For `n = 10` and `x = 2`, `(n + x - 2) = 10` and `(n - x) = 8`.
2. The divisors of 10 are `[1, 2, 5, 10]`.
3. The divisors of 8 are `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.

The program checks these divisors to see if they satisfy the conditions, but it incorrectly filters out some valid `k` values.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify the valid `k` values by checking the conditions for each divisor. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    
    # Check divisors of (n + x - 2)
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n + x - 2) % k == 0 and (n + x - 2) // k >= x:
            output.append(k)
    
    # Check divisors of (n - x)
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - x) % k == 0 and (n - x) // k >= x:
            output.append(k)
    
    # Remove duplicates and sort
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))
```

This corrected version directly checks each possible `k` value from 2 to `n` and ensures that the conditions are met, thus providing the correct number of valid `k` values.
