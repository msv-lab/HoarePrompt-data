Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotients for each divisor in `output1`.**

Explanation: The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1` in place. The values of `output2` remain unchanged because no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `output1` now contains its elements in reverse order compared to its original state, while `output2` retains its original state.
