### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the position `n` and the number `x` for each test case, which are validated to be within the specified range.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` computes all divisors of `x` and returns them in a specific order.
   - This function is used twice in the main loop with slightly different inputs (`n + x - 2` and `n - x`), which is appropriate for the problem.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The logic checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to repeat properly.
   - If they are even, it calls `func_1` on these values and iterates through the returned divisors to check if they satisfy the conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - The results are stored in a set to ensure uniqueness before returning the count.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem specifies that `k > 1`, so the logic correctly handles this by checking the conditions appropriately.
   - The logic also ensures that the divisors are checked against the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`, which is correct for determining valid `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - The final output is the count of valid `k` values, which is correctly calculated and returned.
