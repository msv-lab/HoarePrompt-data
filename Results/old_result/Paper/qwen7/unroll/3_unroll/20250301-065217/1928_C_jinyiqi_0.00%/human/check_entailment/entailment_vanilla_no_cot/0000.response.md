Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` Function**: 
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of `x`. However, the current implementation appends the divisors in reverse order and then returns `output2 + output1`, which is incorrect. It should simply return `output1`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `sep`**:
   - The variable `sep` is used to store divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`. However, the logic to check if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is incorrect. The condition should be checking if `s + 2` is a valid `k` value that fits the given constraints.

3. **Redundant Operations**:
   - The code uses `list(set(output))` to remove duplicates, but it is unnecessary since the divisors found will inherently be unique.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**:
   - The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` and `x` do not satisfy the conditions for any possible `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []

    # Check divisors of (n + x - 2)
    for d in range(2, n + x - 1):
        if (n + x - 2) % d == 0:
            k = d
            if (k + 2) // 2 >= x and (k + 2) % 2 == 0:
                output.append(k)

    # Check divisors of (n - x)
    for d in range(2, n - x + 1):
        if (n - x) % d == 0:
            k = d
            if (k + 2) // 2 >= x and (k + 2) % 2 == 0:
                output.append(k)

    print(len(set(output)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the logic correctly identifies valid `k` values and handles the constraints appropriately.
