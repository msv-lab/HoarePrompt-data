Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements from the original input list up to that index. This means if the original input list is `original_list`, then `a[i]` would be the sum of `original_list[0]` to `original_list[i]`.
   - `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element (except the first one which is 0) is the sum of the previous element in `b` and either 1 or 2 depending on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1 or not.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*a)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `*a` in the `print` statement unpacks the list `a` and prints its elements separated by spaces.
   - Since `a` is constructed as the accumulated sum of elements from the original input list, let's assume the original input list is `original_list = [x0, x1, x2, ..., xn-1]`.
   - Therefore, `a` would be `[x0, x0 + x1, x0 + x1 + x2, ..., x0 + x1 + ... + xn-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the construction of `a`, the output will be the elements of the list `a` printed in a space-separated format.

Output: **[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]**
