Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value that satisfies the condition of the `range` function. Since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input()))`, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer (since `range` with a positive integer `n` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`).

3. **Understand the constraints**: From the problem statement, we know that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`. This means that `int(input())` should return a value within this range for the loop to execute.

4. **Formulate the state**: We need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value between 1 and 100 inclusive. Therefore, the state before the loop must be such that when `int(input())` is called, it returns a value in this range.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected based on the provided constraints.
