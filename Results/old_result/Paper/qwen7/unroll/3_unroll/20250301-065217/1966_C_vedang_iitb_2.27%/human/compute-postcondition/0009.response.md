Output State: **`a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the initial number of stones in each of the n piles, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 but not equal to 2, and `winNext` is the return value of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_2` with two arguments: `a[1:]`, which is the list `a` excluding its first element, and `n - 1`, which is `n` decremented by 1. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `winNext`. The initial values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, but `winNext` now holds the return value from `func_2`.
