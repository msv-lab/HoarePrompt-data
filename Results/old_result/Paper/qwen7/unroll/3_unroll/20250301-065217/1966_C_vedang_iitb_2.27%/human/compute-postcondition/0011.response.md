Output State: **The program returns 1**

Given the conditions:
- `winNext` is the return value of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.
- The condition `(winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1))` is true.

Since the return statement in the code simply returns `1`, regardless of the value of `winNext`, the program will return `1`.
