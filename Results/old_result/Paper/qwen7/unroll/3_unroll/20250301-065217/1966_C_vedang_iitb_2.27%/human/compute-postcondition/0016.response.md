Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and an integer `n` indicating the number of piles. It recursively determines whether the player who starts the game can guarantee a win based on the current configuration of stone piles. If the starting player can guarantee a win, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns 2.**
