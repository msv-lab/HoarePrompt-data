The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of `n` non-negative integers representing the initial number of stones in each of the `n` piles, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. Based on the given cases, the function returns either 1 or 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers and return either 1 or 2 based on certain conditions that are not detailed here.
