### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a number of stones equal to the smallest nonempty pile from all nonempty piles until no moves are possible. The key insight is to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to transform the list of pile sizes into a new list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements after removing duplicates and sorting.
   - This transformation is not necessary for solving the problem correctly. Instead, we should directly compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function attempts to recursively determine the winner based on the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
   - It uses a recursive approach to simulate the game states but does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the Nim-sum.
   - Specifically, the base cases and recursive logic in `func_2` do not align with the correct Nim-sum logic. For example, the base cases handle only two piles, which do not cover all possible scenarios.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
   - If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

5. **Implementation Check**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the Nim-sum.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the problem as stated.

6. **Revised Implementation**:
   - We need to implement a function that computes the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and returns the appropriate winner based on the result.

Here is a revised implementation:

```python
def nim_sum(piles):
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    return 1 if nim_sum != 0 else 2

def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        piles = test_cases[_][1]
        winner = nim_sum(piles)
        if winner == 1:
            results.append("Alice")
        else:
            results.append("Bob")
    return results

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]),
    (2, [1, 7]),
    (7, [1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]),
    (3, [1, 2, 3]),
    (6, [2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4]),
    (8, [5, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 3, 2]),
    (1, [1000000000])
]

results = determine_winner(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This implementation correctly computes the Nim-sum and determines the winner based on the result. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used in this solution, and the logic is based on the correct approach.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is incorrect because it does not use the correct logic (Nim-sum) to determine the winner. The revised implementation provided above correctly solves the problem using the Nim-sum approach.
