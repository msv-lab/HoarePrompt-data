Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem statement. The issue lies in how it processes the test cases. Specifically:

- The program reads an integer `x` at the beginning, which is supposed to be the number of test cases.
- It then enters a loop from `0` to `x`, but it incorrectly uses the same variable names `x` and `y` inside the loop, which shadows the outer variables.

This means that the program will read the number of test cases and then process each test case, but the values of `x` and `y` inside the loop are not correctly assigned from the input.

To fix this, you should use different variable names inside the loop to avoid shadowing the outer variables. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):  # Use _ as the loop variable since we don't need the index
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read two integers for each test case
        if a < b:
            print(a, b)
        else:
            print(b, a)

func()
```

With these changes, the program will correctly process each test case and output the minimum and maximum values as required.
