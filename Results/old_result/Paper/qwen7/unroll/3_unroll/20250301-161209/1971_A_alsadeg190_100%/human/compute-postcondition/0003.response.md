Output State: The output state will consist of pairs of integers printed based on the comparison of the integers provided in each input line for `x` iterations. For each iteration, if the first integer is less than the second integer, the first integer is printed followed by the second integer; otherwise, the second integer is printed followed by the first integer. The total number of printed pairs will be equal to `x`. The specific values printed will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
