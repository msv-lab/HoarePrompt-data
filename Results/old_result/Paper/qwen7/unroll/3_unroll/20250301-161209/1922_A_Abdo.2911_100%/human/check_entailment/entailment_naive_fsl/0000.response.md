Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` to determine if a template is possible. However, this logic is insufficient because it does not account for the case where `a[i]` is different from `b[i]`, but `c[i]` could still match the template if it is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
abcd
ABcd
ABCD
```

- For the first character, `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'A'`, and `c[0] = 'A'`. Since `a[0]` is different from `b[0]`, the program would incorrectly mark this as impossible.
- However, a valid template could be `"Abcd"`, where the first character is uppercase, allowing `c[0] = 'A'`.

Thus, the program fails to correctly determine if a template exists for this case, making it incorrect.
