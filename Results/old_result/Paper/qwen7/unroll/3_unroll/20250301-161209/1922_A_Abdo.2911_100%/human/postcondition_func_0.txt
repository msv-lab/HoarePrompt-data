The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it checks if it's possible to transform string `a` into string `b` using string `c` as an intermediate step. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the transformation is possible according to specific conditions, otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the final output state consisting of 'YES' or 'NO' for each case.
