You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If for any iteration 'possible' is set to True, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final state will be determined by the last printed output after all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` to determine if a template is possible. However, this logic is insufficient because it does not account for the case where `a[i]` is different from `b[i]`, but `c[i]` could still match the template if it is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
abcd
ABcd
ABCD
```

- For the first character, `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'A'`, and `c[0] = 'A'`. Since `a[0]` is different from `b[0]`, the program would incorrectly mark this as impossible.
- However, a valid template could be `"Abcd"`, where the first character is uppercase, allowing `c[0] = 'A'`.

Thus, the program fails to correctly determine if a template exists for this case, making it incorrect.
