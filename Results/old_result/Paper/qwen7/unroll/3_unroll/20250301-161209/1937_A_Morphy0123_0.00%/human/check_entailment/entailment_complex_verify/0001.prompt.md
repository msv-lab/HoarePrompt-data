You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):

    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each `i` from `0` to `n_cases-1`, the program processes an input `n` and prints either `1`, `2 ** power` where `power` is the smallest integer such that `2 ** power >= n` and `power - 1`, depending on whether `n` is `1` or not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)). For each \( n \), it determines and prints either \( 1 \) or \( 2^{\text{power}} \), where \( \text{power} \) is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{power}} \geq n \). The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_cases` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints `1`. This is correct because the array is `[1]` and no swaps are performed.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - For `n > 1`, the program calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
   - It does this by incrementing `power` until `2^power >= n`.
   - If `2^power == n`, it prints `2^power`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `2^(power-1)`.

### Problem Description Recap

- The operation `swap(k)` involves swapping the elements at positions `d` and `k`, where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` that is not equal to `k` itself.
- We need to perform `swap(i)` for each `i` from 2 to `n` and find the final position of the element `1`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Understanding the Swap Operation:**
   - When `swap(k)` is called, the element at position `d` (the largest proper divisor of `k`) is swapped with the element at position `k`.
   - For example, for `k = 6`, the largest proper divisor is `3`, so `a_3` and `a_6` are swapped.

2. **Effect of Swaps on Position of 1:**
   - Initially, the array is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - The element `1` will move to the position corresponding to the largest proper divisor of its current position.
   - Eventually, the element `1` will end up at a position that is a power of 2. This is because the largest proper divisor of a power of 2 is always another power of 2, and this process continues until the element `1` reaches the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` using the loop.
   - However, the logic to determine the final position of `1` is flawed. The program incorrectly prints `2^power` or `2^(power-1)` without considering the actual sequence of swaps.

### Example Analysis

- For `n = 4`:
  - Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - After `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4]`
  - After `swap(3)`: `[3, 1, 2, 4]`
  - After `swap(4)`: `[3, 4, 2, 1]`
  - Final position of `1` is `4`, not `2` or `2^2`.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly determine the final position of `1` in the array after performing the specified swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
