### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if `b[-2] != '>'`. This condition is incorrect because it only checks the second-to-last character of the second row. This check is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the last column.
   - The program also incorrectly handles the case when `n == 1`. Since `n` is always even according to the problem constraints, this case should not be considered.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the columns in steps of 2, checking if the arrow in the second row points right (`>`).
   - If any column in the second row does not point right, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Similarly, it iterates through the odd-indexed columns in the first row, checking if the arrow points right. If any arrow does not point right, it also sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If both loops do not set `no_path` to `False`, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program assumes that `n` is always even, which matches the problem constraints.
   - However, the initial check `if b[-2] != '>'` is incorrect and does not cover all necessary conditions.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not fully implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`. Specifically, the initial check `if b[-2] != '>'` is insufficient and the handling of the case when `n == 1` is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:
**False**
