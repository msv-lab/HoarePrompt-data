Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, where each character is either '<' or '>'. It then checks specific conditions related to the characters in these strings. If certain conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each case based on the specified conditions.**
