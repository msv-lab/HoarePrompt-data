Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Conditions**: The program checks if `b[-2] != '>'` and immediately prints 'NO' if this condition is true. This is too restrictive and does not account for the full logic needed to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

2. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The program uses nested loops and flags (`no_path`) to check conditions, but the logic is overly complex and does not fully capture the necessary conditions for the robot to reach the target cell.

3. **Missing Key Logic**: The program does not properly simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can follow the arrows to reach the target cell (2, n). Instead, it makes assumptions based on the last few characters of the second row and some characters in the first row, which is insufficient.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when the robot can only move horizontally or when the grid size is very large.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
