You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, where each character is either '<' or '>'. It then checks specific conditions related to the characters in these strings. If certain conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each case based on the specified conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`.
   - It then reads two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the last character of the second row (`b[-2]`) is not `'>``, the program immediately prints 'NO'. This check ensures that the robot cannot move to the last column from the second row if the arrow is not pointing right.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'YES' because the robot is already at the target cell `(2, 1)`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program sets a flag `no_path` to `True` initially.
   - It iterates through the second row's string in steps of 2, checking if the arrow is not pointing right. If it finds any such arrow, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` remains `True` after this loop, it means the robot can potentially move to the last column from the second row.
   - It then checks the first row's string in steps of 2, similar to the previous loop but starting from index 1. If any arrow is not pointing right, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Finally, based on the value of `no_path`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The check `if b[-2] != '>'` is correct because if the last column's arrow is not pointing right, the robot cannot move to the last column from the second row.

2. **Single Column Case:**
   - The check `if n == 1` is correct because the robot is already at the target cell `(2, 1)`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The logic of checking the second row in steps of 2 is correct. If any arrow is not pointing right, the robot cannot move to the last column.
   - The logic of checking the first row in steps of 2 is also correct. If any arrow is not pointing right, the robot cannot move to the last column from the first row.

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- The additional constraints (e.g., `n` is even, no arrows point outside the grid) are not explicitly checked in the code but are implied by the problem statement.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), which is handled by the input reading mechanism.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the given constraints and problem description.
