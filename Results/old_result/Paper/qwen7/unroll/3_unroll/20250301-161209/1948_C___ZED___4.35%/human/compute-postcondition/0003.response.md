Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of strings. Each pair consists of two strings of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where each character is either '<' or '>'. The function returns a result based on the comparison of characters in the two strings for each test case.**

Note: The actual logic to process the strings and determine the result is not described here, only the input and output behavior.
