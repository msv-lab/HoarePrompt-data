#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, ans represents the number of times y was updated (i.e., the number of distinct second smallest elements found in the list).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It determines the number of times the second smallest element in each list is updated during the iteration through the list. Specifically, for each test case, it counts how many distinct second smallest elements are found in the list and prints this count.
