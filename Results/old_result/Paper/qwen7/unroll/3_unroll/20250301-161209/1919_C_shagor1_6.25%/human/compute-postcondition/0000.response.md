Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State of the Input Variable**: The variable `t` is mentioned in the state before the loop starts, and it is described as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the input value for the loop should be within this range.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, the input value must be a positive integer and within the specified range. Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the input must be a valid integer that falls within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
