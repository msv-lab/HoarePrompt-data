Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the "first-k-th" settling process. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern is periodic with period \( 2k - 2 \).
   - The position \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) determines the value of \( x \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find all divisors of \( q \) (where \( q = n + x - 2 \)) that are at least \( x - 1 \).
   - These divisors correspond to potential values of \( k \) because \( 2k - 2 \) must be a divisor of \( q \).

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It also checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - The results from both calls are combined and printed after removing duplicates.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It finds all divisors of \( q \) that are at least \( x - 1 \).
   - The main program correctly handles the periodicity and the conditions for \( k \).
   - The use of sets to remove duplicates before counting the number of valid \( k \) values is appropriate.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
