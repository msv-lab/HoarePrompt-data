You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. Both q and x satisfy 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: q is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, w is the square root of q, and if w is an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is [w]. Otherwise, M remains unchanged.
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
    #State: Output State: q is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, w is the square root of q, and M is a list containing integers i and q//i for each i in the range(1, int(w // 1)) such that either i or q//i is greater than or equal to x - 1.
    return M
    #M is a list containing integers i and q//i for each i in the range(1, int(w // 1)) such that either i or q//i is greater than or equal to x - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where both are integers. `q` represents the position Vasya occupied in the line, and `x` represents the number Vasya received during the settling. The function returns a list `M` containing integers `i` and `q//i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to the integer part of `w // 1` (where `w` is a variable not defined in the given context but implied to be related to `q`), such that either `i` or `q//i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: M is a list containing integers i and q//i for each i in the range(1, int(w // 1)) such that either i or q//i is greater than or equal to x - 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
