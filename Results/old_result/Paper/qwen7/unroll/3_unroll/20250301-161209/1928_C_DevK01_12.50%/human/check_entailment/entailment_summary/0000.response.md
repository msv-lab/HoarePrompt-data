Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculation of `y`**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`. This step is correct and necessary for determining the possible values of `k`.

3. **Check for Even `y`**: The program checks if `y` is even. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct because `y` must be even for the settling pattern to repeat correctly.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to generate a list of potential values of `k`. It calculates the integer part of the square root of `q` and checks if any value `i` or `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This logic is correct for identifying valid `k` values.

5. **Adjustments for Large `n`**: The program adjusts the calculation of `q` to account for cases where `n` is large. Specifically, it handles the case where `n >= 3 * x - 2` by adding the results of another call to `func_1` with adjusted parameters. This adjustment is necessary and correct.

6. **Removing Duplicates**: The program uses a set to remove duplicate values from the list `L1` before calculating its length. This ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once, which is correct.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and the execution summary. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
