Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, no valid `k` can exist since `2k - 2` must be even.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is used to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic in `func_1` is as follows:
     - Calculate the square root of `q` and check if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If true, add it to the list `M`.
     - Iterate through all integers from `1` to the integer part of the square root of `q` and check if they are divisors of `q`. If they are and are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, add them to `M`.
     - Similarly, check the corresponding divisors `q // i` and add them to `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates `L1` using `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the results of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.
   - `L1` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

### Verification:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `y` odd, the program correctly prints `0`.
   - For `y` even, the program calculates the divisors correctly and ensures that the divisors are within the required range.

2. **Mathematical Consistency:**
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that all valid `k` values are found and counted correctly.
   - The main logic correctly handles the conditions for adding elements to `L1`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
