Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` is designed to process multiple test cases. It correctly reads the number of test cases `w` and then processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`.
3. It then creates a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length and a list `pl` to store unique stick lengths.
4. The logic to calculate the number of polygons is as follows:
   - For each unique stick length `j`, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length.
   - If so, it adds the integer division of the count of that length by 3 to the variable `shapes`.
5. Finally, it prints the total number of polygons `shapes`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to correctly calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks.

Correctness: **True**
