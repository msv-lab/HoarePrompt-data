Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `w = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `w`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code. The value of `w` is now an integer input from the user, which is within the range specified for the initial state of `t`.
