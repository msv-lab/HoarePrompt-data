Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number in the array \( a \). If no such segment exists, it outputs -1. The function does not return any parameters but prints the result for each test case.**
