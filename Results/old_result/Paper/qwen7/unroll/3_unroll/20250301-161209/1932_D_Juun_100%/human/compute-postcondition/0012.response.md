Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted list of the original elements in descending order, `t` is the number of cards processed, `n` is the number of non-empty suits encountered, `answers` is a list containing strings representing pairs of ranks and suits that were already paired, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to either the highest rank encountered for each suit or None if no rank was encountered.**

Explanation: The code `trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)` sorts the `trumps` list in descending order. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `answers`, and `suits`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
