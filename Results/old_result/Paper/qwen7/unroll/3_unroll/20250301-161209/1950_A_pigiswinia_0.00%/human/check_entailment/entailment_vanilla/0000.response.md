### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.
4. **Output Format**: The program outputs the results in the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to check for stairs and peaks based on the provided conditions and handles the input and output as specified, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
