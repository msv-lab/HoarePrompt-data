Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`) are met.
4. If the conditions are met, it prints the corresponding string ('STAIRS' or 'PEAK').
5. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
6. The program logic matches the problem description exactly.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all the specified conditions correctly, there are no errors in the program.

Correctness: **True**
