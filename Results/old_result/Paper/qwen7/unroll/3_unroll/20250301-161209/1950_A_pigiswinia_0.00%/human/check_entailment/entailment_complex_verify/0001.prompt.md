You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. Specifically, for each input triplet (a, b, c), if \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIRS'; if \(a < b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The exact sequence of these outputs depends on the user's input during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints either 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. If `a < b < c`, it prints 'STAIRS'; if `a < b > c`, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.
4. **Output Format**: The program outputs the results in the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to check for stairs and peaks based on the provided conditions and handles the input and output as specified, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
