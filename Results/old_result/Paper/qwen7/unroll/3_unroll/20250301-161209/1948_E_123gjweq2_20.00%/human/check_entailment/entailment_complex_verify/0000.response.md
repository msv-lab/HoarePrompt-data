### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
- Edges are added between pairs of vertices \( (i, j) \) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
- The goal is to minimize the number of cliques.

#### Function Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**
   - Computes `cliques` as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - Initializes `arr` and `cliquess` as lists of zeros.
   - Calls `make_array` for each `clique` from 0 to `cliques - 1`.
   - Prints the contents of `arr`, `cliques`, and `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**
   - Assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` in a specific pattern.
   - The first half of the range `[left, left + mid - 1]` gets values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`.
   - The second half of the range `[left + mid, left + not_mid + mid - 1]` gets values from `right` to `right - not_mid + 1`.

#### Key Points to Evaluate
1. **Clustering Vertices**: The program attempts to cluster vertices into groups based on the value of `cliques`.
2. **Edge Formation**: The edges are formed based on the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
3. **Clique Partitioning**: The program aims to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

#### Detailed Evaluation
1. **Initial Clustering**:
   - The program divides the vertices into `cliques` based on `ceil(n / k)`.
   - This division ensures that each group of vertices has a similar range of values assigned to them.

2. **Edge Formation**:
   - The `make_array` function assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` in a way that ensures the edges are formed according to the given condition.
   - For example, if `left = 0` and `right = 4`, the first half of the range will get values from 1 to 2, and the second half will get values from 5 to 4.

3. **Clique Partitioning**:
   - The program ensures that vertices within the same `clique` are close enough to form edges.
   - The values assigned to vertices in the same `clique` are consecutive, ensuring that the distance condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs within the same `clique`.

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly handle the clustering and edge formation, ensuring that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Conclusion
The original assessment was **inaccurate**. The program correctly implements the logic to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints.

**Final: True**
