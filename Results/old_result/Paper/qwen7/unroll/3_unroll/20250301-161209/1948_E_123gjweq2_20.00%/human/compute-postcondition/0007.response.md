Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, `i` should be set to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`. Therefore, `not_mid` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `not_mid` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `not_mid`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than 0**
