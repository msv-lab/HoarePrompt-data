Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The function reads user input to determine the number of iterations of a loop, which calls another function `func_1` but does not modify the string `a`. After the loop completes, the function returns the original string `a` unchanged.**
