Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases, and `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
