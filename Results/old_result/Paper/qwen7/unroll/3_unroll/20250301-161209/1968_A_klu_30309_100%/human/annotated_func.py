    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases, and `results` is a list of integers where each element is the value of `best_y` calculated for the corresponding `x` in `test_cases`. The calculation for each `x` involves finding the integer `y` (where 1 < y < x) that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`, and appending this `y` to the `results` list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers called `results` where each element is the value of `best_y` calculated for the corresponding `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the integer (where 1 < y < x) that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it calculates the integer `best_y` (where 1 < `y` < `x`) that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`, and returns a list of these `best_y` values corresponding to each `x` in `test_cases`.
