Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `x` for each test case.
2. The function `func_1` iterates through each `x` in `test_cases` and finds the integer `y` (where \(1 < y < x\)) that maximizes the sum of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
3. For each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1. It then iterates backward from `x-1` down to 1, calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
4. If the current sum of `gcd_val + y` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary further calculations.
5. After processing all `x` values, the function returns the list of `best_y` values, which corresponds to the required output format.

Given the provided code and the explanation, the program logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected output according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
