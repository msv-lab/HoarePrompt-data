Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a flaw in how it handles the cases where `n` is even and the promotion price `b` is less than twice the regular price `a`. Specifically, the logic for even `n` does not correctly account for the optimal way to use the promotion.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Odd `n`:**
   - The current logic checks if `2 * a < b` and then decides whether to buy all yogurts individually or use the promotion. This part is mostly correct.
   
2. **Even `n`:**
   - For even `n`, the logic directly prints `n // 2 * b` without considering the possibility of using the promotion optimally. It should also check if buying `n-1` yogurts with the promotion and the last one individually might be cheaper.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        else:
            # Check both ways: all promotions and mixed strategy
            cost_promotion_only = n // 2 * b
            cost_mixed = (n // 2 - 1) * b + a
            print(min(cost_promotion_only, cost_mixed))
```

This corrected function ensures that for even `n`, it considers both the pure promotion strategy and the mixed strategy to find the minimum cost.
