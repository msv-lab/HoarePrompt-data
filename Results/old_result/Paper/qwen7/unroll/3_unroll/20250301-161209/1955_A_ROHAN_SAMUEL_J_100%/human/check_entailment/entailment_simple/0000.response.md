Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is as follows:
   - If `n` is odd:
     - It checks if `2 * a < b`. 
       - If true, the cost is `a * n` because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
       - If false, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a` because buying pairs of yogurts is cheaper.
   - If `n` is even:
     - It checks if `2 * a < b`.
       - If true, the cost is `a * n` because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
       - If false, the cost is `n // 2 * b` because buying pairs of yogurts is cheaper.
4. The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required.
5. The conditions and logic seem to cover all possible scenarios correctly based on the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
