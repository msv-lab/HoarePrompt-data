Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each representing the result of one test case. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b + a`, depending on whether `2 * a < b` holds. If `n` is even, it always prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b`. Each line's content depends on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for that test case.
