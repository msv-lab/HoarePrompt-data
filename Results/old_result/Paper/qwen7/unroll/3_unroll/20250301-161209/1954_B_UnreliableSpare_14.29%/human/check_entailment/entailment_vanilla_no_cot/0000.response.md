Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not properly defined**: The function `func_1` is called in the main loop but is not defined within the program. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining if the array is beautiful**: The program checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made beautiful using the specified operation. The program should identify sequences where the condition \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) holds true and count the minimum deletions required to break these sequences.

3. **Incorrect handling of the minimum deletions calculation**: The program calculates the minimum deletions incorrectly. It assumes that the array is already beautiful and tries to find the minimum deletions needed to break it. However, it should correctly identify and count the minimum deletions required to break any sequence where \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Identify sequences where a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}
    deletions = 0
    i = 1
    while i < n - 1:
        if arr[i] == arr[i - 1] and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
            deletions += 1
            i += 2  # Skip the next element since it will be part of the next sequence
        else:
            i += 1
    
    if deletions == 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(deletions)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

This corrected version identifies and counts the minimum deletions required to break any sequence where \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\), ensuring the array is no longer beautiful.
