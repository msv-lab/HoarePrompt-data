Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `val` and `cnt`. `val` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, and `cnt` is initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
