Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).
3. The program checks if the array is already a sequence of identical elements. If it is, it calculates the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
4. If any two consecutive elements differ, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.

However, there are several issues with the implementation:
- The function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, but it reads input directly from standard input. This means the function should take parameters to correctly process each test case.
- The logic to determine if the array is already a sequence of identical elements is unnecessary and incorrect. The problem statement guarantees that the array is beautiful, meaning it can always be made into a sequence of identical elements by the allowed operations.
- The variable `flag` is not used correctly. It is set to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different, but this does not help in determining the minimum number of elements to remove.
- The logic to find the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements is flawed. The variable `cnt` is only incremented when `arr[i] == val`, which does not account for the actual longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
