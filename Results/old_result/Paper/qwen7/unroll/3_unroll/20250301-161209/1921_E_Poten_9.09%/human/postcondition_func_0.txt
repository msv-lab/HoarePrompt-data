The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). It checks specific conditions and based on the values of these integers, it determines whether Alice, Bob, or a Draw occurs. The function then prints the outcome for each test case in the order they were processed.
