### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - If Alice's initial row (`x_a`) is greater than Bob's initial row (`x_b`), or if Alice is in the last row (`x_a == h`), the game is a draw.
   - This part is straightforward and correctly implemented.

2. **Parity Check**:
   - If both `x_a` and `x_b` are even or both are odd, the logic proceeds to check the relative positions of Alice and Bob.
   - The parity check ensures that we handle different scenarios where the players' movements might lead to a draw or a win.

3. **Positional Comparison**:
   - If Alice and Bob are in the same column (`y_a == y_b`), the game is a draw.
   - If Alice is to the left of Bob (`y_a < y_b`), the program checks the distance between them and the midpoint of their rows. Depending on the distances, it determines if Alice or Bob can force a win or if it results in a draw.
   - Similarly, if Alice is to the right of Bob (`y_a > y_b`), the program performs similar checks.

4. **Special Cases**:
   - If Alice is in the first column and Bob is in the last column, or vice versa, the program handles these special cases appropriately.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the result for each test case, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the detailed breakdown, the provided code appears to cover all the necessary conditions and correctly implements the logic for determining the outcome of the game. The conditions and checks are well-defined and should handle all the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game for each test case.

**Correctness: **True**
