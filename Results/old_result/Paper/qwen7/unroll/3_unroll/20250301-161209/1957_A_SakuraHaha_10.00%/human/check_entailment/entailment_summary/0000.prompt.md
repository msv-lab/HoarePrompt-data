Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)





# Execution Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks in the current test case, and then `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the counts of each unique stick length divided by 4 and prints this sum for each test case.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
