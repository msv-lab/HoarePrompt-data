Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers determined by user input for each iteration, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is a list of pairs (u, v) representing edges in a graph, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the key is an integer node and the value is a list of integers representing connected nodes, `ends` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ends = []` creates an empty list named `ends`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `edges`, `empty`, or `nodes`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
