Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and we have read two integers from input and assigned them to `n` and `t` respectively.**

The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. The value of `t` remains 1 as specified in the initial state, and `u` and `v` remain unchanged within their respective ranges. The value of `n` is updated to the first input integer, and `t` is updated to the second input integer.
