Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `n` and `k` are assigned the values from input split by space, and `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.**

This means that the variable `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `k` are assigned the values inputted by the user, separated by a space. The list `a` is yet to be defined and will be populated later in the program.
