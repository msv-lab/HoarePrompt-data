Output State: `wins` is between 0 and `n`, inclusive. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.

After the loop executes, `wins` will be the number of elements in the list `a` that are less than or equal to the element at index `k-1`. The loop breaks as soon as it encounters an element greater than the element at index `k-1`.
