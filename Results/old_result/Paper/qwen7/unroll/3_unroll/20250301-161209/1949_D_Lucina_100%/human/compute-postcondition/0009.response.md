Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range specified as `range(1, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables `i` and `n` are the ones that need to be considered.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive). Since `i` starts at `1`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that `n` is an input integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 24`, and `i` starts at `1`, the loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `1` and `n` is at least `1`.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
