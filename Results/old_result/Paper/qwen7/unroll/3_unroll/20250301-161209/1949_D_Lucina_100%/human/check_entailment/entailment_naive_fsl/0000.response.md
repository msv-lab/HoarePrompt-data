Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. 

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
5
.??F?
.?S?.
F??.?
??S?.
??.?.
```

**Expected Output:**
A valid output should ensure that no more than 4 consecutive videos of the same type appear for any permutation of the scenarios. However, the provided program does not achieve this.

**Output Produced by the Program:**
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```

**Analysis:**
- For the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the sequence of videos is `FFFFF`, which violates the condition since there are 5 consecutive F's.
- For the permutation `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`, the sequence of videos is `FF.SF`, which is valid.
- For the permutation `[1, 4, 2, 3, 5]`, the sequence of videos is `FFS.F`, which is valid.
- For the permutation `[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]`, the sequence of videos is `FFFFF`, which again violates the condition.

Since the program fails to produce a valid output for at least one permutation of the scenarios, the program is incorrect.
