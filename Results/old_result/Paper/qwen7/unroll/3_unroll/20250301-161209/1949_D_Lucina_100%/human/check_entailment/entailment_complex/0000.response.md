Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by determining the type of transition videos for undecided cells (`?`) based on the counts of `F` and `S` for each scenario. However, the logic implemented in the code does not fully address the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type exist for any permutation of scenarios. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Counting `F` and `S`:**
   - The code correctly counts the occurrences of `F` and `S` for each scenario.
   - This is a good start, but it does not account for the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

2. **Determining the Type for Undecided Cells:**
   - The code checks if the count of `F` is greater than `S` for a scenario and sets the undecided cells to `F` or `S` accordingly.
   - This logic does not consider the constraint about consecutive videos of the same type. For example, if a scenario has more `F` than `S`, setting all undecided cells to `F` might still result in too many consecutive `F` videos for some permutations.

3. **Handling the Constraint:**
   - The code does not implement any mechanism to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive `F` or `S` videos exist for any permutation of scenarios.
   - The logic for deciding the type of transition video for undecided cells based on the first quarter of scenarios is not sufficient to guarantee the required constraint.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
