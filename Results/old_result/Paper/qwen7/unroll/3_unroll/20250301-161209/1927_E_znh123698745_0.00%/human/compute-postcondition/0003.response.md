Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives a list of test cases, where each test case contains three integers: t, n, and k. It returns a result based on the conditions specified for n and k.**

To break it down:
- The function does not explicitly accept any parameters through its definition (`def func():`).
- However, it is implied that the function processes input data, likely in the form of a list of test cases.
- Each test case consists of three integers: `t`, `n`, and `k`.
- The constraints for these integers are:
  - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is even.
  - The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The function's output is determined by the values of `n` and `k` within each test case, but the specific output (what it returns) is not detailed in the given information.
