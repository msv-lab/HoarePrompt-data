The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of numbers based on the following rules: starting with 1, it alternates between moving forward and backward through the array of numbers from 1 to \( n \), until all elements are visited. The exact sequence depends on the values of \( n \) and \( k \) but follows the described alternating pattern.
