Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\), and prints the result. The function reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input first, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and then processes each test case accordingly. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated sums for each case.**
