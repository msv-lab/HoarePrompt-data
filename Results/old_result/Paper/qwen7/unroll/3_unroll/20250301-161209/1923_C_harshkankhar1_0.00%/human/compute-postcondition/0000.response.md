Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `q`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the previous values of `t`, which is no longer relevant since it was not involved in the operation. The values of `n` and `q` are now known to be positive integers within the specified range, but their specific values are not known. All other variables remain unchanged.
