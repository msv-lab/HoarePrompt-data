The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it first reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `c`. It then updates an auxiliary array `b` based on the values in `c`. After that, it prints the accumulated sums of `c` up to each index. Finally, for each query, it compares the difference between the accumulated sums at indices `y` and `x-1` with the corresponding differences in the auxiliary array `b`, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met or 'NO' otherwise.
