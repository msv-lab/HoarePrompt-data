You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it first reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `c`. It then updates an auxiliary array `b` based on the values in `c`. After that, it prints the accumulated sums of `c` up to each index. Finally, for each query, it compares the difference between the accumulated sums at indices `y` and `x-1` with the corresponding differences in the auxiliary array `b`, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met or 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `c`.
   - It then processes `q` queries, where each query specifies a subarray defined by indices `l_i` and `r_i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is called for each test case.
   - It initializes variables `n` and `q` from the input.
   - It creates an array `a` with a leading zero and populates it with the elements of `c` plus one.
   - It creates another array `b` initialized to zeros and updates it using a loop to compute a cumulative sum-like structure.
   - It prints the cumulative sums of `a`.
   - It processes each query, checking whether the subarray is "good" based on the conditions provided.

3. **Checking if Subarray is Good:**
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `a[l_i:r_i+1]` and compares it with the corresponding segment of `b`.
   - If the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` holds, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it checks if `x != y` and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise 'NO'.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Condition 1:** The sum of elements in the subarray should match the sum of the corresponding segment in `b`.
- **Condition 2:** Elements in the subarray `a` must not equal the corresponding elements in `b`.
- **Condition 3:** All elements in `b` must be positive.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `b`:**
   - The array `b` is incorrectly initialized and updated. It should reflect the cumulative sum of a modified version of `a` where each element is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `a[i]`.
   - The current implementation of `b` does not correctly reflect the required conditions.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking "Good" Subarray:**
   - The logic for checking if a subarray is "good" is flawed. Specifically, the comparison `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` does not correctly capture the necessary conditions for a subarray to be "good".

### Corrected Approach

To correctly determine if a subarray is "good," we need to:
1. Compute the prefix sums of `a` and `b`.
2. Check if the subarray sum matches the corresponding segment in `b`.
3. Ensure no element in the subarray equals the corresponding element in `b`.
4. Ensure all elements in `b` are positive.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good." Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
