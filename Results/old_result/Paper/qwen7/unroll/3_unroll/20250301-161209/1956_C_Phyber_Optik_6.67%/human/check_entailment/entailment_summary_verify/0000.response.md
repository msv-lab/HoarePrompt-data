### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to maximize the sum of the matrix \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} \).
- The maximum sum can be achieved by setting each element \( a_{i,j} \) to \( i + j - 1 \).
- We can achieve this by performing \( n \) type 1 operations and \( n \) type 2 operations.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates a sum using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) and another part of the sum based on the value of \( i \).
   - This calculation is irrelevant to the actual operations needed to maximize the sum.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the calculated sum and \( n + r \).
   - It then prints a series of operations, but the operations do not correctly set the elements of the matrix to \( i + j - 1 \).

#### Correct Solution:
- To maximize the sum, we need to set each element \( a_{i,j} \) to \( i + j - 1 \).
- This can be achieved by performing \( n \) type 1 operations and \( n \) type 2 operations.

#### Program Implementation:
- The program does not perform the necessary operations to set the elements of the matrix to \( i + j - 1 \).
- Instead, it prints a series of operations that do not achieve the desired result.

#### Example:
For \( n = 2 \):
- The desired matrix after operations would be:
  ```
  [1, 2]
  [2, 3]
  ```
  The sum would be \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 \).

But the program outputs:
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This results in a sum of 7, which is not the maximum possible sum.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. It calculates a sum without actually performing the operations to achieve the maximum possible sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
