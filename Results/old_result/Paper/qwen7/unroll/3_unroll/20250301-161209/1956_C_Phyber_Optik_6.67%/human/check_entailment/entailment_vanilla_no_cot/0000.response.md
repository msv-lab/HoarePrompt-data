Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the sum of the matrix by distributing values in a specific way. However, the logic for calculating `sum` and `r` is flawed.
   - The intended goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix by filling it with permutations of values from 1 to \( n \). The current implementation does not achieve this.

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations**:
   - The program prints `n + r` operations, where `r` is calculated incorrectly. This does not guarantee that the operations will result in the maximum possible sum.
   - The operations themselves do not follow the rules specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that each operation is either a row-wise or column-wise permutation as required.

3. **Incorrect Permutations**:
   - The program prints permutations in a fixed manner without considering the actual requirements of the problem. The permutations should be chosen such that they maximize the sum of the matrix, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to generate appropriate permutations for rows and columns to fill the matrix with the highest possible values. The solution should ensure that the sum of the matrix is maximized within the constraints of using at most \( 2n \) operations.
