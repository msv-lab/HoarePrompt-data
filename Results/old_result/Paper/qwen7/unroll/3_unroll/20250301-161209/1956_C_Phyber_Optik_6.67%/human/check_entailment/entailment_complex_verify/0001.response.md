### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n` and checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2` (the sum of the first `n` natural numbers) is greater than `i * n`.
   - If the condition is true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
   - Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.

3. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required (`n + r`).
   - It then performs the operations:
     - For the first `n` operations (if `r` is 0, it will be `n`), it performs Type 1 operations.
     - For the remaining `r` operations, it performs Type 2 operations.

4. **Type 1 Operations:**
   - For each operation, it sets the entire first row to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Type 2 Operations:**
   - For each operation, it sets the entire first column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation logic is correct. The sum is calculated based on the largest possible values that can be placed in the matrix without exceeding the constraints.
   - The variable `r` is correctly determined as the smallest integer such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

2. **Output Format:**
   - The program correctly prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required (`n + r`).
   - The operations are printed in the correct format, starting with either `1` or `2` followed by a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Type 1 and Type 2 Operations:**
   - The program correctly performs Type 1 operations by setting the entire first row to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The program correctly performs Type 2 operations by setting the entire first column to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Number of Operations:**
   - The program ensures that the total number of operations does not exceed `2n`. This is achieved by performing `n` Type 1 operations and `r` Type 2 operations, where `r` is determined based on the sum calculation.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the required operations within the constraints.
