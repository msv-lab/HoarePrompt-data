Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the program calculates the sum without actually performing the operations to achieve the maximum possible sum. The program uses a formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` to calculate part of the sum, which is not relevant to the actual operations needed to maximize the sum.

To maximize the sum, we need to set each element \(a_{i,j}\) to the value \(i + j - 1\). This can be achieved by performing \(n\) type 1 operations and \(n\) type 2 operations. However, the provided program does not perform these operations.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

For \(n = 2\):

- The desired matrix after operations would be:
  ```
  [1, 2]
  [2, 3]
  ```
  The sum would be \(1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8\).

But the program outputs:
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This results in a sum of 7, which is not the maximum possible sum.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution and hence is incorrect.
