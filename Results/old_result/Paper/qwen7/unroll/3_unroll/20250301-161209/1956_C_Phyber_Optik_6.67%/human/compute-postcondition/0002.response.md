Output State: The output state will consist of `t` pairs of lines. Each pair starts with a line containing two numbers: the value of `sum` and `n + r`. Following this, there will be `n + r` lines, each starting with either 1 or 2. Lines starting with 1 will contain `j` followed by `j` repeated `n` times. Lines starting with 2 will contain 2 followed by `j % n` repeated `n` times. The exact values of `sum` and `r` depend on the input `n`, but the structure of the output remains consistent for each iteration of the loop.
