Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, there will be two lines:

1. The first line contains two integers: the value of `sum` and `n + r`.
2. The second line contains either `n` or `n + r` lines, each representing a sequence of numbers. Each line starts with either `1` or `2`, followed by a space-separated list of numbers from `1` to `n`.

For each iteration, `sum` is calculated based on the given logic, and `r` is determined by the condition in the inner loop. The exact values of `sum` and `r` depend on the input `n` for each iteration. The second part of the output generates a specific pattern of numbers based on the values of `n` and `r`.
