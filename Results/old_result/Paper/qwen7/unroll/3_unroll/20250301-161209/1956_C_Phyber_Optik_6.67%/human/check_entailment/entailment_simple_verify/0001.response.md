### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n` and checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2` (the sum of the first `n` natural numbers) is greater than `i * n`.
   - If the condition is true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
   - Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.

3. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required (`n + r`).
   - It then performs the operations:
     - For the first `n` operations (if `r` is 0, it will be `n`), it performs Type 1 operations.
     - For the remaining `r` operations, it performs Type 2 operations.

4. **Type 1 Operations:**
   - For each operation, it sets the entire first row to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Type 2 Operations:**
   - For each operation, it sets the entire first column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum sum is correct. The program correctly determines the maximum sum by considering the largest possible values that can be placed in the matrix.
   - The variable `r` is correctly set to the smallest integer such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

2. **Output Format:**
   - The program correctly outputs the sum and the number of operations in the required format.
   - The operations are correctly identified as Type 1 and Type 2 operations.

3. **Operations Execution:**
   - The program correctly performs the operations as specified:
     - For the first `n` operations, it sets the first row to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - For the remaining `r` operations, it sets the first column to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed `2n`, which is the upper limit specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program, it is clear that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the required operations within the constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
