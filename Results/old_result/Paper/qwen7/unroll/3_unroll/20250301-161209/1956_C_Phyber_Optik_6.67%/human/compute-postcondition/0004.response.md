Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. The function validates that t is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and n is between 1 and 500 inclusive. Additionally, the sum of n^2 across all test cases does not exceed 5 Ã— 10^5. For each valid test case, the function performs some unspecified operation (since the specific operation is not detailed), and returns the result(s) accordingly.**
