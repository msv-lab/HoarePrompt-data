### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to maximize the sum of the matrix \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} \).
- The maximum sum can be achieved by setting each element \( a_{i,j} \) to \( i + j - 1 \).
- This requires \( n \) type 1 operations and \( n \) type 2 operations.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       n = int(input())
   ```
   - Correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix for each test case.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   ```python
   sum, r = 0, 0
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
           r = i
           sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
       else:
           sum += i * n
   ```
   - This part is incorrect. It attempts to calculate the sum using a formula that is not relevant to the problem. The formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is not directly related to the operations needed to maximize the sum.

3. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(sum, n + r)
   for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
       if j <= n:
           print(1, j, end=' ')
           print(*range(1, n + 1))
       else:
           print(2, j % n, end=' ')
           print(*range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   - The output is generated based on the incorrect sum calculation and the value of `r`. The operations printed do not correspond to the required operations to maximize the sum.

#### Correct Solution:
To maximize the sum, we need to set each element \( a_{i,j} \) to \( i + j - 1 \). This can be done by:
- Performing \( n \) type 1 operations to set the rows.
- Performing \( n \) type 2 operations to set the columns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                sum += i + j - 1
        print(sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(i, i + n))
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(j, j + n))
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
