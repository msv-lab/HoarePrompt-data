### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the main logic and conditions of the program. Let's break down the key points to verify the correctness:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads from standard input and parses the input values `k`, `x`, and `a` from each test case.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 2`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`:
       - It calculates `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Calculation of `z`:**
   - The calculation of `z` in the loop seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win enough times to accumulate any desired number of coins.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used within the loop, which iterates `x - k + 3` times.

### Detailed Explanation of `z` Calculation

- **Initial Value of `z`:**
  - Initially, `z` is set to `k - 2`.

- **Loop Iteration:**
  - The loop runs `x - k + 3` times.
  - In each iteration, `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Case `x < k - 1`:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win enough times to get any number of coins because he can place a bet of 1 coin after a loss.
   - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start with at least one win.

2. **Case `x == k - 1`:**
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can still win enough times to get any number of coins because he can place a bet of 1 coin after a loss.
   - The condition `a >= x + 2` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start with at least two wins.

3. **Case `x > k - 1`:**
   - The loop calculates `z` to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win enough times.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins over multiple wins and losses.
   - The condition `a >= z` checks if Sasha has enough initial coins to reach the calculated value `z`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:** `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
  - Since `x < k - 1`, we check if `a >= x + 1`.
  - `7 >= 1 + 1` is true, so the output is 'YES'.

- **Test Case 2:** `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
  - Since `x < k - 1`, we check if `a >= x + 1`.
  - `1 >= 1 + 1` is false, so the output is 'NO'.

- **Test Case 3:** `k = 2`, `x = 3`, `a = 15`
  - Since `x > k - 1`, we calculate `z`.
  - `z = 2` (initial value).
  - Loop runs `3 - 2 + 3 = 4` times.
  - After 4 iterations, `z` becomes 16.
  - Since `15 >= 16` is false, the output is 'NO'.

- **Test Case 4:** `k = 3`, `x = 3`, `a = 6`
  - Since `x == k - 1`, we check if `a >= x + 2`.
  - `6 >= 3 + 2` is false, so the output is 'NO'.

- **Test Case 5:** `k = 4`, `x = 4`, `a = 5`
  - Since `x > k - 1`, we calculate `z`.
  - `z = 2` (initial value).
  - Loop runs `4 - 3 + 3 = 4` times.
  - After 4 iterations, `z` becomes 16.
  - Since `5 >= 16` is false, the output is 'NO'.

- **Test Case 6:** `k = 5`, `x = 4`, `a = 7`
  - Since `x > k - 1`, we calculate `z`.
  - `z = 3` (initial value).
  - Loop runs `4 - 3 + 3 = 4` times.
  - After 4 iterations, `z` becomes 21.
  - Since `7 >= 21` is false, the output is 'NO'.

- **Test Case 7:** `k = 4`, `x = 88`, `a = 1000000000`
  - Since `x > k - 1`, we calculate `z`.
  - `z = 2` (initial value).
  - Loop runs `88 - 3 + 3 = 88` times.
  - After 88 iterations, `z` becomes a large value.
  - Since `1000000000 >= z` is true, the output is 'YES'.

- **Test Case 8:** `k = 25`, `x = 69`, `a = 231`
  - Since `x > k - 1`, we calculate `z`.
  - `z = 23` (initial value).
  - Loop runs `69 - 24 + 3 = 48` times.
  - After 48 iterations, `z` becomes a large value.
  - Since `231 >= z` is false, the output is 'NO'.

- **Test Case 9:** `k = 13`, `x = 97`, `a = 18806`
  - Since `x > k - 1`, we calculate `z`.
  - `z = 11` (initial value).
  - Loop runs `97 - 12 + 3 = 88` times.
  - After 88 iterations, `z` becomes a large value.
  - Since `18806 >= z` is false, the output is 'NO'.
