### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Sasha can place bets in a casino where:
  - Winning a bet of \( y \) coins results in a gain of \( y \cdot (k - 1) \) coins.
  - Losing a bet of \( y \) coins results in a loss of \( y \) coins.
- Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times consecutively.
- Initially, Sasha has \( a \) coins.
- The goal is to determine if Sasha can eventually have at least \( n \) coins for any \( n \).

#### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case and checks the conditions based on the values of \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \):

1. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), the program checks if \( a \geq x + 1 \).
   - If true, it prints 'YES'.
   - If false, it prints 'NO'.

2. **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**
   - If \( x = k - 1 \), the program checks if \( a \geq x + 2 \).
   - If true, it prints 'YES'.
   - If false, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
   - If \( x > k - 1 \), the program calculates \( z \) using the formula:
     \[
     z = (k - 2) + \left\lfloor \frac{z}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - It then checks if \( a \geq z \).
   - If true, it prints 'YES'.
   - If false, it prints 'NO'.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads input from standard input, processes each line containing integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
- It prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions.
- The function does not return any value but prints the result for each line of input.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
   - This condition is correctly handled. If Sasha can afford to lose up to \( x \) times and still have at least \( x + 1 \) coins, he can eventually win enough to exceed any desired number of coins \( n \).

2. **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**
   - This condition is also correctly handled. If Sasha can afford to lose up to \( k - 1 \) times and still have at least \( k \) coins, he can eventually win enough to exceed any desired number of coins \( n \).

3. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
   - The calculation of \( z \) is flawed. The formula used in the program does not correctly account for the exponential growth of Sasha's coin count over multiple rounds of betting.
   - The formula should be:
     \[
     z = (k - 2) \cdot (k^{x - (k - 1)}) + (k - 2)
     \]
   - This formula ensures that Sasha can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses and still have enough coins to eventually win any number of coins \( n \).

Given the flaw in the calculation of \( z \), the program does not correctly determine if Sasha can achieve his goal for all cases, especially when \( x > k - 1 \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can eventually win any number of coins, especially when \( x > k - 1 \). The provided solution needs to be revised to use the correct formula for \( z \).
