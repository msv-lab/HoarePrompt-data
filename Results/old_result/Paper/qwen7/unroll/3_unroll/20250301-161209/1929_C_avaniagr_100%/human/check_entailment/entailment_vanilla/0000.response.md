Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads from standard input and parses the input values `k`, `x`, and `a` from each test case.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 2`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`:
       - It calculates `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Calculation of `z`:**
   - The calculation of `z` in the loop seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win enough times to accumulate any desired number of coins.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used within the loop, which iterates `x - k + 3` times.

### Detailed Explanation of `z` Calculation

- **Initial Value of `z`:**
  - Initially, `z` is set to `k - 2`.

- **Loop Iteration:**
  - The loop runs `x - k + 3` times.
  - In each iteration, `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Case `x < k - 1`:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win enough times to get any number of coins because he can place a bet of 1 coin after a loss.
   - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start with at least one win.

2. **Case `x == k - 1`:**
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can still win enough times to get any number of coins because he can place a bet of 1 coin after a loss.
   - The condition `a >= x + 2` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start with at least two wins.

3. **Case `x > k - 1`:**
   - The loop calculates `z` to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win enough times.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins over multiple wins and losses.
   - The condition `a >= z` checks if Sasha has enough initial coins to reach the calculated value `z`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all cases and uses the correct conditions to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
