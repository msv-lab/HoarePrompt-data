Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it non-beautiful. However, there are some issues with the logic and implementation:

1. The program incorrectly identifies whether the array needs to be made non-beautiful by counting the maximum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element (`tmp`). This approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

2. The logic for checking if the array is already beautiful and printing `-1` when all elements are the same is correct.

3. The main issue lies in the calculation of `ans`. Instead of finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition, the current logic finds the longest sequence of consecutive elements equal to the first element. This does not necessarily give the correct answer.

To fix the program, we need to identify the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same and calculate the number of removals needed to break this sequence. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i-1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)

# Example usage:
func()
```

This corrected version:
1. Iterates through the array to find the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same.
2. If the entire array is one sequence (i.e., `max_length == n`), it prints `-1`.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the number of elements to remove to break this sequence, which is `n - max_length`.

Given the above explanation, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
