Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
2. The solution iterates through the array and counts the length of consecutive segments where the elements are equal to the first element of the segment. It then finds the minimum length of such segments and prints it. If all elements in the array are the same, it prints -1.
3. The logic in the code checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. This approach correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
4. The constraints and additional conditions are handled appropriately, ensuring that the solution works within the given limits.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
