Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the encoded value (`lex`).

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value into a word.
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` to store the decoded values.
   - It tries to fill `arr` with values by checking ranges:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 (for 'a') and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 26 (for 'z') and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it again appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.

3. **Appending Remaining Value**:
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted.
   - It then prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr`, converting them to their respective letters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic**:
   - The logic for decoding is flawed. It does not correctly handle the range of possible values for `lex`. For example, if `lex` is 27, the program will append 26 twice, which is incorrect.
   - The program does not ensure that the values in `arr` represent valid letters. For instance, it might append 26 multiple times, leading to invalid characters like 'z' appearing multiple times.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `lex` is exactly 26, 52, etc., which should result in specific letters ('z', 'aa', etc.).

3. **Lexicographical Smallest Word**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the lexicographically smallest word is produced. It sorts the list `arr`, but this does not necessarily produce the smallest word.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Determine the possible values for each character in the word.
2. Ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        word = ""
        for j in range(3):
            if lex >= 27:
                word += 'a'
                lex -= 26
            else:
                word += chr(lex + 96)
                lex = 0
        print(word)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed decoding logic and lack of handling edge cases. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
