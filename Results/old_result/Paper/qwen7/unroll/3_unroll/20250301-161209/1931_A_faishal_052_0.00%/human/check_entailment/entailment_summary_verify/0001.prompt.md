You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads an integer `lex` and transforms it based on certain conditions. Specifically, if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it replaces `lex` with 1; otherwise, it replaces `lex` with 26. After processing, it sorts the transformed values and prints the first three characters corresponding to these values, converted to lowercase letters. The function does not return any value but outputs the processed characters for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the encoded value (`lex`).

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value into a word.
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` to store the decoded values.
   - It tries to fill `arr` with values by checking ranges:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 (for 'a') and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 26 (for 'z') and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it again appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.

3. **Appending Remaining Value**:
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted.
   - It then prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr`, converting them to their respective letters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic**:
   - The logic for decoding is flawed. It does not correctly handle the range of possible values for `lex`. For example, if `lex` is 27, the program will append 26 twice, which is incorrect.
   - The program does not ensure that the values in `arr` represent valid letters. For instance, it might append 26 multiple times, leading to invalid characters like 'z' appearing multiple times.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `lex` is exactly 26, 52, etc., which should result in specific letters ('z', 'aa', etc.).

3. **Lexicographical Smallest Word**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the lexicographically smallest word is produced. It sorts the list `arr`, but this does not necessarily produce the smallest word.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Determine the possible values for each character in the word.
2. Ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        word = ""
        for j in range(3):
            if lex >= 27:
                word += 'a'
                lex -= 26
            else:
                word += chr(lex + 96)
                lex = 0
        print(word)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed decoding logic and lack of handling edge cases. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
