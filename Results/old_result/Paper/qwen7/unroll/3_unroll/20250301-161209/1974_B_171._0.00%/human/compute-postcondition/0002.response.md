Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop is iterating over `encoded`, so the variable being used in the loop is `char`.
   - The loop itself does not directly modify `mapping` or `decoded`.

2. Determine the initial state of the loop:
   - `mapping` is an empty dictionary.
   - `decoded` is an empty list.

3. Consider the condition for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `encoded`.
   - Once `encoded` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

4. Adjust the states accordingly:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `encoded`, the state of `encoded` must be such that it contains at least one element for the loop to start executing.
   - The variables `char`, `mapping`, and `decoded` will be modified within the loop body, but their initial states do not affect whether the loop starts.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `encoded` to ensure the loop can start executing.

State: **`encoded` must contain at least one element**
