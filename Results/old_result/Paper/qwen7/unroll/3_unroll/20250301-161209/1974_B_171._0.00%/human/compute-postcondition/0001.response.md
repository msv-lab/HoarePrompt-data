Output State: **`mapping` is an empty dictionary; `decoded` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `decoded` as an empty list. The initial state of `mapping` as an empty dictionary remains unchanged. Therefore, both `mapping` and `decoded` are updated in the output state accordingly.
