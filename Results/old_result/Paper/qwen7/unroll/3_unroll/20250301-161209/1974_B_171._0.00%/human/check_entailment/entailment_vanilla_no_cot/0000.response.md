Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the string but it does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly map characters from the encoded string back to the original string. Instead of creating a mapping from unique characters in the encoded string to their corresponding symmetric characters, it incorrectly tries to find the next available lowercase letter that hasn't been used yet. This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to use the auxiliary string `r` in the correct manner.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

This corrected function first creates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string. It then creates a mapping where each character in `r` is paired with its symmetric counterpart. Finally, it decodes the encoded string using this mapping.
