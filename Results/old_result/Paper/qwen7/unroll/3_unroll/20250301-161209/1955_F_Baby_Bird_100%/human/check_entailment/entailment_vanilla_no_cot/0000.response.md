Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used in the program does not accurately determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given conditions. Specifically, the formula `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3` does not correctly account for the bitwise XOR condition and the optimal strategy for Bob to win.
