Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. However, the given program calculates a value based on the input using a formula, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

To illustrate, let's consider the first test case: `1 1 1 0`. The program outputs `1`, but according to the problem description, the correct output should be `1` because Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet. However, the program's logic does not account for the actual game dynamics and the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

The formula used in the program does not reflect the complexity of the game and the optimal strategy for Eve. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
