Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `i` is a loop counter that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The expression `int(input())` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - Given: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value that is within the range specified for `t`.
   - Therefore, the input to `int(input())` must be `t`, and `i` will take values from 0 to `t-1`.

5. **Final State After Adjusting:**
   - The initial state of `t` should be preserved as it is the input that determines the number of iterations.
   - The loop counter `i` should be set to 0 initially.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0**
