Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each test case within the loop. For each test case, the value of `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) will determine the output based on specific conditions. If `k` is a power of 2, it will print `k`. If `k` is odd, it will print `1`. If `k` is even but not a power of 2, it will find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, subtract that from `k`, and continue this process until `k` becomes a power of 2 or 1, then print the final value of `k`.

In summary, the output will be a sequence of integers, either the original `k`, `1`, or the result of the described process for each test case.
