Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for pairs of indices `(k, k+j)` in the string where either the characters at these indices are equal or one of them is a question mark. If such pairs exist and their count equals `j`, it prints `2*j` and returns immediately. If no valid pairs are found for any `j` from half the length of the string down to 1, it prints `0`. The function does not return anything explicitly but outputs a value based on the conditions met within the string.**
