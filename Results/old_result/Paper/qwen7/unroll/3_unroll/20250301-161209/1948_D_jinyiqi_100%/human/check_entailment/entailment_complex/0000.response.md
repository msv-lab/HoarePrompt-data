Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1()`. The function iterates through possible lengths of tandem repeats starting from the largest possible length down to 1.
- For each length `j`, it checks every possible substring of length `j` to see if it forms a tandem repeat by comparing characters or allowing question marks.
- If a valid tandem repeat of length `2*j` is found, it prints `2*j` and exits the function.
- If no valid tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, it prints `0`.
- The main loop correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1()` for each input string.
- Given the constraints and the logic, the program should work as expected to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat.

Correctness: **True**
