Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j`, `n`, and the step `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` in the range `n // 2, 0, -1`. This means `j` should start at `n // 2` and decrement by 1 until it reaches 1 (since the step is `-1`).

3. **Determine the value of `n`**: The variable `n` is the length of the list `s`, so `n` must be the length of the list `s`.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 because if `n` is less than 2, the range `n // 2, 0, -1` would not include any valid starting points.

5. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that `j` starts at `n // 2` and that `n` is at least 2.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `t`, `s`, and `n`.

- `t` is not directly related to the loop execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
- `s` is a list of characters, but its contents don't affect the loop execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
- `n` must be at least 2, and `j` must start at `n // 2`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2, and `j` must start at `n // 2`**.
