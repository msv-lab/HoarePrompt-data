Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order; `output2` contains the corresponding quotients for each divisor in the new `output1`.**

Explanation: The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1`. This means that while the values in `output1` remain the same (all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`), their order is now reversed. The corresponding values in `output2` (which contain the quotients for each divisor) do not change.
