You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, listed in reverse order, followed by their corresponding quotients.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) based on the given constraints. Specifically, the program uses an incorrect approach to calculate the possible values of \( k \).

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Possible Values of \( k \)**:
   - The program attempts to use `func_1` to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but it does not correctly filter out the valid values of \( k \).
   - The logic inside the loops to check if the calculated value of \( k \) is valid is flawed. It checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`, which is not the correct condition to determine if \( k \) is a valid value.

2. **Missing Consideration of the Pattern**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. The program does not account for this periodicity correctly.
   - The program should consider the position \( x \) within the repeating cycle and determine the valid \( k \) values based on the position and the length of the cycle.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to determine the number of divisors of \( \frac{n - x}{2} \) and \( \frac{n + x - 2}{2} \), ensuring that \( k > 1 \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_possible_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n - x) // 2
        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(k)) + 1):
            if k % i == 0:
                if i > 1:
                    count += 1
                if k // i > 1 and i != k // i:
                    count += 1
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n + x - 2) // 2
        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(k)) + 1):
            if k % i == 0:
                if i > 1:
                    count += 1
                if k // i > 1 and i != k // i:
                    count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_possible_k(n, x))
```

This corrected program correctly counts the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints.
