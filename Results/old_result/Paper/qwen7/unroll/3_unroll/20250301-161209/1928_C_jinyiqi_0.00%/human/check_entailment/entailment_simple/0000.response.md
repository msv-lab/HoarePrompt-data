### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling are consistent with the given rules.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - The position \( x \) must fit within one of these repeating segments.
   - The value of \( k \) must satisfy certain conditions derived from the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.
   - This is used to determine the possible values of \( k \).

4. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If \( (n + x - 2) \) is even.
     2. If \( (n - x) \) is even.
   - For each condition, it uses `func_1` to find divisors and then filters those divisors to find valid \( k \).
   - The filtering condition ensures that \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( x \).

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) are handled correctly.
   - The logic for finding valid \( k \) is sound and matches the problem requirements.

6. **Output Handling**:
   - The final output is a set of unique valid \( k \), which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints and conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
