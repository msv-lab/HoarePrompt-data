Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - It splits the input into `n` and `x` for each test case.

2. **Checking Conditions for Valid `k`:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` is even and if `(n - x)` is even.
   - If either condition is met, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate value and processes the results.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It calculates both proper divisors and their corresponding pairs.
   - The function returns the divisors in a specific order (though the order is not critical for the logic).

4. **Processing Divisors:**
   - For each divisor `s` from `func_1`, the program checks if `(s + 2)` is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If both conditions are met, the divisor `(s + 2) / 2` is added to the `output` list.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set and then back to a list to remove duplicates.

### Correctness Check

1. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates all divisors of the given number.
   - However, the logic for determining valid `k` values seems flawed because:
     - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` should be checked against `n` instead of `x`.
     - The divisor `s` should be checked if it fits within the range `[1, n]`.

2. **Condition for Valid `k`:**
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` should be replaced with `(s + 2) / 2 <= n` to ensure `k` is within the valid range.
   - Additionally, the condition `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` need to be consistent with the problem statement.

### Revised Logic

Here is a revised version of the logic to ensure correctness:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    
    # Check for (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) // 2 <= n:
                output.append((s + 2) // 2)
    
    # Check for (n - x) % 2 == 0
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) // 2 <= n:
                output.append((s + 2) // 2)
    
    output = list(set(output))
```

### Conclusion

Given the revised logic, the original program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine valid `k` values. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
