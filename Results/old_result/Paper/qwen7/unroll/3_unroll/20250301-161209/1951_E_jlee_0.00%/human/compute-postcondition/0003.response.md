Output State: The output state will depend on the input integer `t` and the strings provided as input within each iteration of the loop. For each input string, the program checks specific conditions and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional details if applicable. If the string meets certain criteria, it may also print indices or substrings. After all iterations, the final output consists of all printed statements from each iteration.
