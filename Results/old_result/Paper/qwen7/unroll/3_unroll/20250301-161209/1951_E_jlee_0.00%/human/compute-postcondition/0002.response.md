Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each representing the result of one iteration of the loop. For each iteration:

- If the input string has a length of 1, it will print 'NO'.
- If the first character is different from the last character, it will print 'YES' followed by 1 and the input string.
- If all characters are the same, it will print 'NO'.
- If exactly one character is different from the others and the string length is odd, or if the middle character is different and there's another character different from the rest, it will print 'NO'.
- If exactly one character is different from the others and the string length is even, it will print 'YES' followed by 1 and the input string.
- If there are two different segments in the string where the first segment's characters do not match the second segment's characters, it will print 'YES' followed by 2 and the two segments.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it will print 'NO'.
