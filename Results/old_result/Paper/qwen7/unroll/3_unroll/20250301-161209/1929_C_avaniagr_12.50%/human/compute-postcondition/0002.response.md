Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically, it will depend on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each input provided within the range specified by `t`. Each line of output will indicate whether the condition was met ('YES') or not ('NO').
