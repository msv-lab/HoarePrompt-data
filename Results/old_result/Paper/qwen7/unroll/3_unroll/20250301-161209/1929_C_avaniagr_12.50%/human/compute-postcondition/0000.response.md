Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
