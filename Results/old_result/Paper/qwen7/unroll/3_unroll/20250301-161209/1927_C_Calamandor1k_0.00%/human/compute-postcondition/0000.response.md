Output State: **t is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. All other conditions and constraints regarding `n`, `m`, `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still valid.
