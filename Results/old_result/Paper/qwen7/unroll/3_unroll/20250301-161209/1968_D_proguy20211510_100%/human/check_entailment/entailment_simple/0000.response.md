### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), the permutation \( p \), and the array \( a \). This part is correct.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the path taken by Bodya and Sasha separately using a while loop. It ensures that each player's path is recorded until a cycle is detected (i.e., a previously visited position is encountered again).
   - This calculation is done correctly, and it ensures that the paths are correctly stored in `pathb` and `paths`.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya (`resb`) and Sasha (`ress`) based on their respective starting positions and the lengths of their paths.
   - The logic for calculating the scores is correct. It uses the formula `pre + path[i] * (k - i)` to compute the maximum possible score for each player, considering the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").
   - The logic for comparing the scores and printing the results is correct.

Given that the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including parsing the input, calculating the paths, computing the scores, and determining the winner, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
