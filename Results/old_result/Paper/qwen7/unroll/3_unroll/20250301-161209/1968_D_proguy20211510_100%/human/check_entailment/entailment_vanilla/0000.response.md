### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them into integers.
2. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**: 
   - The function constructs the path for Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p` and their respective starting positions.
   - It uses a `vis` array to ensure that a position is not revisited, which prevents infinite loops.
3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns.
   - It iterates through the path arrays and computes the maximum possible score for each player.
4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores, it compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result.

### Analysis:

- The logic for constructing the paths and calculating the scores seems correct.
- The use of `vis` arrays ensures that the paths do not revisit positions, which is necessary for the game rules.
- The score calculation logic is correct and follows the game rules accurately.
- The comparison and output logic are also correct.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
