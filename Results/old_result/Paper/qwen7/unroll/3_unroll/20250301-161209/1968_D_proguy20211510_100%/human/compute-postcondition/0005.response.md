Output State: The output will be determined based on the comparison of `resb` and `ress` after processing each test case. `resb` represents the maximum possible sum Sasha can achieve starting from `pb`, and `ress` represents the maximum possible sum Bodya can achieve starting from `ps`. The loop will print "Bodya" if `resb` is greater than `ress`, "Sasha" if `ress` is greater than `resb`, and "Draw" if they are equal.
