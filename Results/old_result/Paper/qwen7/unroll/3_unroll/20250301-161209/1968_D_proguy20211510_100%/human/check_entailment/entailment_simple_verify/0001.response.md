### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function correctly parses the input values `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them into integers.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**:
   - The function constructs the path for Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p` and their respective starting positions.
   - It uses a `vis` array to ensure that a position is not revisited, which prevents infinite loops.
   - This part is also correct and aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns.
   - It iterates through the path arrays and computes the maximum possible score for each player.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the score calculation logic. The formula used in the score calculation is:
     ```python
     curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
     ```
     This formula assumes that the player will stay at the current position for the remaining turns, which is not necessarily true according to the problem statement. The player can choose to move to the position specified by the permutation `p` at any turn.

   - The correct approach should consider both staying at the current position and moving to the next position in the permutation. The score calculation should account for the maximum possible score considering both options at each step.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores, it compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result.
   - This part is correct, but it relies on the accuracy of the score calculation, which is flawed as discussed above.

### Analysis:

- The logic for constructing the paths and ensuring no revisits is correct.
- The score calculation logic is incorrect because it does not account for the player's choice to move or stay at each turn.
- The comparison and output logic are correct but are based on an incorrect score calculation.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The score calculation logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
