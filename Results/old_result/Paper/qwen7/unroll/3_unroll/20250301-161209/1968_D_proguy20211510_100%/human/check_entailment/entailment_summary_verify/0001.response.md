### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function correctly parses the input values `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them into integers.
   - This part of the code is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**:
   - The function constructs the path for Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p` and their respective starting positions.
   - It uses a `vis` array to ensure that a position is not revisited, which prevents infinite loops.
   - However, there is a potential issue here. The `vis` array is reset to `[0] * n` before each player's path is calculated. This means that if a player revisits a position, it will not be marked as visited again, leading to incorrect paths. This could cause the function to get stuck in an infinite loop if the permutation allows revisiting positions.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns.
   - It iterates through the path arrays and computes the maximum possible score for each player.
   - The logic for calculating the scores is correct and follows the game rules accurately.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores, it compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result.
   - The comparison and output logic are also correct.

### Analysis:

- The main issue lies in the path construction logic. The `vis` array is reset to `[0] * n` before each player's path is calculated, which means that revisited positions are not marked as visited again. This could lead to incorrect paths and potentially infinite loops.
- The function assumes that the paths do not revisit positions, but this assumption is not always true due to the way the `vis` array is handled.

### Conclusion:

The provided program has a logical flaw in the path construction logic. The `vis` array should be used to mark positions as visited during the entire process of constructing the paths for both players. Resetting the `vis` array before each player's path calculation can lead to incorrect paths and potential infinite loops.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed path construction logic.
