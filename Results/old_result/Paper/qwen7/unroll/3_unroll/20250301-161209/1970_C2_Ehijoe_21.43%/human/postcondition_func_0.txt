The function accepts a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node (integer) and its value is a list of its neighbors (integers), an integer `start` representing the starting node, and an optional integer `parent` representing the parent node (used recursively to avoid revisiting the parent node). It returns a list containing either 0 or 1 plus the distances from each node connected to `nodes[start]` and not equal to `parent`, as calculated by itself for each node. If the starting node has only one neighbor which is the parent, it returns a list containing 0. Otherwise, it calculates the distances from each connected node to the starting node, excluding the parent, and returns these distances in a list.
