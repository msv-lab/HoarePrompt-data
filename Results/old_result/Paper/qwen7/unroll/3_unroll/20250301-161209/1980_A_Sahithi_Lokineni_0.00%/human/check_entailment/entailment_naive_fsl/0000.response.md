Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems that need to be created. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that each round requires a unique set of difficulty levels, and it incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of problems needed can be calculated by comparing the frequency of each difficulty level to the number of rounds.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `5`. Here's why:

- The bank has the following difficulties: B, G, E, C, D, B, D, C, B, E.
- For 2 rounds, we need at least one problem of each of the 7 difficulty levels ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G').
- The bank only has 2 'B's, 2 'C's, 2 'D's, and 2 'E's, which means we need to create additional problems for the remaining difficulty levels ('A', 'F', 'G').

Thus, the correct answer is 5 (one for each of 'A', 'F', and 'G', plus the extra 'B', 'C', and 'D' needed).

The program fails to handle this scenario correctly, making it incorrect.
