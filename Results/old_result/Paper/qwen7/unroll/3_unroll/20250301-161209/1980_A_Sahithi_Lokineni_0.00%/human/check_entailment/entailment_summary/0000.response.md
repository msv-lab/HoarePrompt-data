Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The `defaultdict` is initialized with `default_value`, but `default_value` is never defined. This will raise a NameError.
2. The logic for calculating the minimum number of additional problems needed is flawed. The current implementation assumes that the number of required problems for each difficulty level is `m - d[val]` for all values of `val` in `d.keys()`. However, this does not account for the fact that Vlad needs at least one problem of each required difficulty level for each round, and it does not handle the case where `d[val]` is greater than `m`.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that we count the shortfall for each difficulty level separately and sum these shortfalls. We also need to initialize `defaultdict` with `0` to avoid the `NameError`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize with 0 instead of default_value
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

Given the above explanation, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
