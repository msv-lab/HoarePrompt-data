Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on whitespace, `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `t`. Since `idx` is initially 0, `t` is set to the integer value of `data[0]`. The values of `n`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged except that `idx` is incremented by 1 due to the assignment operation.
