Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of pairs of cards in your hand using the `Counter` from the `collections` module.
   - It then returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and half the number of turns (`n // 2`). This ensures that even if you have more pairs, Nene will play optimally to minimize your score.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the solution accurately computes the maximum number of points you can achieve by playing optimally. The logic aligns with the rules of the game and the strategy described for Nene's optimal play.
