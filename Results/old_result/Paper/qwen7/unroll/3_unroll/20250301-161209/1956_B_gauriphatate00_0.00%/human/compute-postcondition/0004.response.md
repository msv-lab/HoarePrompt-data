Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on whitespace, `idx` is 2**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was set to 1. After executing `idx += 1`, the value of `idx` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
