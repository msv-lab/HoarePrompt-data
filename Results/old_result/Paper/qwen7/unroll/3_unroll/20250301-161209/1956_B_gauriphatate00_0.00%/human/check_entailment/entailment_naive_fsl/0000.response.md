Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game dynamics as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of pairs of cards that can be formed from the given hand, but it does not account for the optimal strategy of both players. According to the problem description, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the current implementation does not reflect this behavior.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  1 1 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided functions):
  ```
  2
  ```

This discrepancy arises because the function `func_1` simply counts the number of pairs of cards without considering the optimal strategy of Nene. In the given example, Nene would play optimally to ensure that you do not get more than 1 point. Therefore, the correct output should be 1, not 2.

The provided solution does not handle the strategic aspect of the game where Nene always tries to minimize your score while maximizing hers. Thus, the program is incorrect.
