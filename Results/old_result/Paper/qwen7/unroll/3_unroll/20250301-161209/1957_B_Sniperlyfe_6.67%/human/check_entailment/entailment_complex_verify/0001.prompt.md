You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and `k` is reduced to 0 after all iterations.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and the last element is `2*k-1` with `k` being 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is set to `k-1`. After iterating through the list, it adjusts the last element to `2*k-1` and sets `k` to 0. The function then returns the list `nums`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
   - The function initializes an array `nums` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then iterates through the array, setting each element to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits (i.e., a number like `111...1` in binary).
   - After setting the elements, it adjusts the last element to ensure the total sum is `k`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The approach in `func_1` sets most elements to the largest possible value with the same bit length as `k`. This ensures that the bitwise OR of these values will have many 1s.
   - However, this approach doesn't necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. For example, if `k` is small, setting most elements to the largest possible value might not be optimal.
   - Additionally, the adjustment of the last element to make the sum `k` might not always produce the best solution in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Example Test Cases:
1. **Test Case:**
   - Input: `1 5`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The program outputs `5`, which is correct since `5` is the only number and it sums to `5`.

2. **Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `1 2`
   - Explanation: The program outputs `1 2`, which sums to `3` and has a bitwise OR of `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), which is correct.

3. **Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 5`
   - Expected Output: `5 0`
   - Explanation: The program outputs `5 0`, which sums to `5` and has a bitwise OR of `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), which is correct.

4. **Test Case:**
   - Input: `6 51`
   - Expected Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
   - Explanation: The program outputs `3 1 1 32 2 12`, which sums to `51` and has a bitwise OR of `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 47` (binary `101111`), which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to handle the examples correctly but may not always produce the optimal solution in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. However, without a more detailed analysis of edge cases and counterexamples, we cannot definitively say it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not guarantee the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR for all cases, although it works correctly for the provided examples.
