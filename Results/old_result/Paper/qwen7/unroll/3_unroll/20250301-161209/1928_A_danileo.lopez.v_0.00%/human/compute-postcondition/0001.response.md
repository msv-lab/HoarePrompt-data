State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The initial state of `t` being an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive) ensures that `t` is a positive integer, but we need to explicitly state that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
