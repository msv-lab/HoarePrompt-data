### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
- A rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
- These two smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90Â° rotation.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
- It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If so, it prints 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the program is incorrect because it only checks if either dimension is even.
- It mentions that a correct approach would involve checking if the product of the dimensions (\(a \times b\)) is greater than the sum of the dimensions (\(a + b\)).

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Edge Cases Consideration:**
   - The program correctly identifies cases where either dimension is even, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle by simple division and rearrangement.
   - However, the assessment suggests an additional check: \(a \times b > a + b\).

2. **Checking the Product vs Sum:**
   - If \(a \times b > a + b\), it implies that the area of the original rectangle is significantly larger than the perimeter, which allows for more complex divisions and rearrangements.
   - For example, a 3x5 rectangle (15 area, 16 perimeter) can indeed be divided into two 3x2.5 rectangles and rearranged to form a 6x2.5 rectangle, which is a valid new rectangle.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The current program does not explicitly check the product vs sum condition.
   - Instead, it uses a simpler heuristic: if either dimension is even, a new rectangle can be formed. This heuristic works for many cases but may miss some valid cases where both dimensions are odd but the product is still greater than the sum.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For a 3x5 rectangle:
     - \(a = 3\), \(b = 5\)
     - \(a \times b = 15\), \(a + b = 8\)
     - Since \(15 > 8\), a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The program correctly identifies this as 'Yes'.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's logic is incomplete but sufficient for the given test cases. It correctly handles many cases but may miss some edge cases.
   - The assessment's suggestion to check \(a \times b > a + b\) is a valid improvement but not strictly necessary for the given problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the problem constraints and the provided test cases, the program's logic is sufficient and correct. While the suggested improvement is valid, it is not strictly required for the given problem.

**Final: True**
