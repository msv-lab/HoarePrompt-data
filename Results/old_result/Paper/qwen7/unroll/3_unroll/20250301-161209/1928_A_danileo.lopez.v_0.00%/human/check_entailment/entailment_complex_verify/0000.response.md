### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect. The current logic only checks if either dimension (`a` or `b`) is even, which is insufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. The program fails to account for cases where both dimensions are odd but can still form a new rectangle through rearrangement.

Let's analyze the annotated code and the problem description more closely:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - These smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - The new rectangle must be different from the original one unless it is a 1x1 square.

2. **Current Program Logic**:
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
   - If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
   - If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'No'.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - **3x5 Rectangle**: Both dimensions are odd. The program would incorrectly return 'No'.
   - **3x5 Rectangle**: Can be cut into two 3x2.5 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 6x2.5 rectangle. This should return 'Yes'.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves checking if the product of the dimensions (`a * b`) is greater than the sum of the dimensions (`a + b`). This condition ensures that the original rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine if a new rectangle can be formed. The logic needs to be revised to include the check for the product being greater than the sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect according to the problem description and the provided examples.
