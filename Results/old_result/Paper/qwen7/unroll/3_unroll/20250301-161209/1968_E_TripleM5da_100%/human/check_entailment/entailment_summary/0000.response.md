Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\), which consists of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program generates a specific pattern of cell coordinates:
   - It always prints "1 1" and "1 2".
   - Then, for each subsequent row from 3 to \(n\), it prints the coordinate pair "i i".

3. Let's analyze the Manhattan distances generated by this pattern:
   - The distance between "1 1" and "1 2" is \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - The distance between "1 1" and "i i" (for \(i \geq 3\)) is \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1)\).
   - The distance between "1 2" and "i i" (for \(i \geq 3\)) is \(|1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-2)\).

4. For \(n \geq 3\), the distances generated include:
   - 1 (from "1 1" to "1 2")
   - Distances \(2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2(n-2)\) (from "1 1" to "3 3", "4 4", ..., "n n")
   - Distances \(0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2(n-3)\) (from "1 2" to "3 3", "4 4", ..., "n n")

5. This pattern ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) includes all even numbers from 0 up to \(2(n-2)\), and the number 1. For odd \(n\), it also includes the number 2. Therefore, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized to \(n-1\) for \(n \geq 3\).

6. The program correctly handles the first two test cases (for \(n=2\)) by printing only the required pairs.

Given that the program correctly generates the required coordinates to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n \geq 2\), the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
