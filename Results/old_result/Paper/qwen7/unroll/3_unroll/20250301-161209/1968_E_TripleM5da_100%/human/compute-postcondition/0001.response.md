Output State: The output consists of multiple lines. For each test case, it starts with two lines "1 1" and "1 2". Then, for a given \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \)), there are \( n-2 \) lines starting from "3 3", "4 4", ..., up to \( n n \). The exact number of lines depends on the value of \( n \) for each test case.
