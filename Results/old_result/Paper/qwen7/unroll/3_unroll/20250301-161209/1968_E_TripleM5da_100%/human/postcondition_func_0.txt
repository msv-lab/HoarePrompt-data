The function processes multiple test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it outputs a sequence of lines containing pairs of integers. Specifically, it starts with the pair "1 1", followed by "1 2", and then continues with pairs ranging from "3 3" to "n n" (inclusive), where `n` is the second parameter for each test case. The total number of lines output for each test case is `n`, regardless of the value of `t`.
