Reasoning:
The given program attempts to generate a set of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). However, upon closer inspection, the program's logic does not seem to cover all possible values of \(n\) effectively. Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Loop over Test Cases**: The program correctly loops over the number of test cases \(t\).
2. **Input \(n\)**: For each test case, it correctly reads the value of \(n\).
3. **Initial Points**: 
   - The first two points printed are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - Then, for each \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints \((i, i)\).

However, the program does not consider the full range of possible Manhattan distances for different values of \(n\). Specifically:
- For \(n = 2\), the program outputs \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), which indeed gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), but this is not the optimal solution for larger \(n\).
- For \(n = 3\), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which is not the optimal solution.
- For \(n = 4\), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is not the optimal solution.
- For \(n = 5\), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which is not the optimal solution.
- For \(n = 6\), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which is not the optimal solution.

The optimal solutions for these values of \(n\) should include points that achieve the maximum possible Manhattan distances. For example:
- For \(n = 3\), the optimal solution is \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\).
- For \(n = 4\), the optimal solution is \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

Given that the program does not generate the optimal solutions for \(n > 2\), it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
