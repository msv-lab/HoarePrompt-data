Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function calculates and returns the index `i` that minimizes the difference between `i` and `n/2` while ensuring that the number of '0's up to index `i` is less than half the total count of '0's and '1's up to that point, or the number of '1's from index `i+1` to the end is less than half the total count of '0's and '1's from that point onwards.**
