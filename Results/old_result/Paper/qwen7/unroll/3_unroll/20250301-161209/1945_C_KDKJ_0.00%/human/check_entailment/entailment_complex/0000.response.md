### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly processes the input string `a` to compute the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position using the list `S`.
   - It then iterates through the list `S` to find the optimal position `i` where the road should be laid. This position `i` is determined by checking if the number of '0's up to `i` is less than half the total count of '0's and '1's up to that point, or if the number of '1's from `i+1` to the end is less than half the total count of '0's and '1's from that point onwards.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it checks if the current `i` is closer to the center of the village (`n/2`) compared to the previously found optimal position. If so, it updates the optimal position.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the state of the variable `a` is not modified across different test cases.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for laying the road for each test case.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as expected.
   - The logic for determining the optimal position `i` is sound and matches the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
