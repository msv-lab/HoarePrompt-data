Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 for each test case, `q` is a lambda function that prints '? %d' % d followed by reading a line of input and splitting it into integers, and the result of the split is assigned to a map object.**

In this case, the lambda function `q` is defined, which prints a query in the specified format and reads a line of input, splitting it into integers. However, no variables are assigned specific values or modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
