Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`.
   - We need to ensure that `int(input())` provides a valid number of iterations.

3. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `q` is a lambda function that prints `'? %d' % d` followed by reading a line of input and splitting it into integers, and the result is assigned to a map object.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop will run for the number of times specified by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is within a reasonable range (as defined by the constraints).

Given these points, the state adjustments needed are:

- Ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a valid integer.
- The number of iterations should be within the range that the problem specifies.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment should be:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and the input to `int(input())` must be a valid integer within the range of the loop iterations.**

In a more concise format:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and the input to `int(input())` must be a valid integer within the loop iteration range.**
