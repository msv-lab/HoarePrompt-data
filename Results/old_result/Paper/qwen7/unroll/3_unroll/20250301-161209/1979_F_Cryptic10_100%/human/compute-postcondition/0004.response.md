Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of integers. For each test case, it repeatedly queries the user for pairs of integers, removes them from the set, and records operations. After processing all pairs, it reconstructs and prints a specific sequence of integers based on the recorded operations and the remaining elements in the set. The final output consists of two lists concatenated and printed in reverse order for each test case.**
