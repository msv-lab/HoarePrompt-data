Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and for each test case, n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function returns different outputs based on the input data.**

This means the function does not take any parameters itself but works with input data structured as described, processing multiple test cases, each with its own n and a series of integers a_i, and returning results accordingly.
