Reasoning:
The given program attempts to find the maximum beauty of the array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. However, the problem requires maximizing the sum of differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for `i` from `2` to `n`. Simply finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values does not achieve this goal.

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Here's why:

1. When the array is sorted, the largest differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` are achieved because the largest and smallest values are placed at opposite ends.
2. Sorting ensures that the differences are maximized since the next largest value follows the smallest value, and so on.

The provided solution does not sort the array, which means it does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
