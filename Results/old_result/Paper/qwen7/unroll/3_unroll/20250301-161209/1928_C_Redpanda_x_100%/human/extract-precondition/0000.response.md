Precondition: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.** 

Note: The provided function `func_1` seems to be incomplete and does not directly relate to solving the problem described. It appears to be a helper function for generating prime factors, but it is not fully implemented and lacks the context needed to solve the main problem. The precondition is based on the input `n` for this function, which is part of the problem constraints.
