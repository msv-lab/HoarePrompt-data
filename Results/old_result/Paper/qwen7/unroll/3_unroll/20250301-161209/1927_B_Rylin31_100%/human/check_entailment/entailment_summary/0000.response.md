Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to construct a string `s` from its trace `a`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `i` times, where `i` is the number of test cases (`t`).

2. **String Construction**: For each test case, it initializes an empty string `ans` and a list `s` of zeros with length `n`. It then maps the input list `a` into the list `s` and constructs the string `ans` by appending characters based on the current values in `s`.

3. **Character Mapping**: The character appended to `ans` is determined by converting the current value of `s[j]` to a character using `chr(s[j] + 97)`, which correctly maps the integer to a lowercase letter ('a' to 'z').

4. **Updating Trace List**: After appending a character to `ans`, the corresponding value in `s` is incremented by 1, ensuring that the next time the same character is encountered, the count is updated correctly.

5. **Output**: The constructed string `ans` is printed for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given that the program follows the specified logic and produces the expected output for the provided examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
