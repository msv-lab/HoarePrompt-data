You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n`. It then constructs a string `ans` by iterating through the list `a` and appending characters based on the current value of `s[j]` (initialized to 0 for each index `j`) plus 97, then increments `s[j]` by 1 for each iteration. Finally, it prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - An empty string `ans` is initialized.
   - A list `s` of size `l` (which is `n`) is initialized with zeros. This list will be used to keep track of the count of previous occurrences of each character.

3. **Building the String**:
   - For each element `j` in the trace array `array`:
     - The program appends a character to `ans`. The character is determined by the value of `s[j]`, which represents the count of previous occurrences of the current character.
     - The value of `s[j]` is incremented by 1 after appending the character to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the trace array, the constructed string `ans` is printed.

### Reasoning:

- **Trace Array Interpretation**: 
  - The trace array `array` at index `i` indicates how many times the character at position `i` has appeared before in the string.
  - For example, if `array[i] = k`, it means the character at position `i` has appeared `k` times before in the string.

- **Character Assignment**:
  - The program uses the value of `s[j]` to determine the character to append to `ans`. Specifically, `s[j]` gives the count of previous occurrences of the character, and this count is used to select a character from 'a' to 'z'.
  - Since `s[j]` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time, it effectively maps to the characters 'a' to 'z'.

- **Guaranteed Validity**:
  - The problem guarantees that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string `s`.
  - The program constructs a string based on the trace, ensuring that the conditions of the trace are met.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to construct a string from the given trace. It handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.
