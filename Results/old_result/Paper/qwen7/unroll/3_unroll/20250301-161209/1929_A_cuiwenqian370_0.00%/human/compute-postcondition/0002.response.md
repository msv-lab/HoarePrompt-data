Output State: **`left` is 0, `arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `left = 0` initializes the variable `left` to 0. The initial state of `arr` as a list of n integers sorted in ascending order and `new_arr` being an empty list remains unchanged.
