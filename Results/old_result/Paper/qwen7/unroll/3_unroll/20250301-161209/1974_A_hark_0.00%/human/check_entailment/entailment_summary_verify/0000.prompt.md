You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_2()`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the initial value of `t`, which remains unchanged throughout the execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic within `func_2` is flawed. 

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Mixed Icons**: The formula used to calculate the number of screens for mixed icons (both 1x1 and 2x2) is incorrect. The current implementation subtracts `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` from `x`, which is not aligned with the grid constraints. For example, placing a 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, but the remaining space calculation should consider how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle the placement of 1x1 icons optimally after placing 2x2 icons. For instance, if there are 15 1x1 icons and 2 2x2 icons, the program might not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:

- **Input**: `15 2`
- **Expected Output**: `2` (since we can place 2 2x2 icons on one screen and the remaining 11 1x1 icons on another screen).
- **Actual Output**: The program might output `1` or `3` depending on the incorrect logic.

To fix this, a more detailed and accurate approach is needed to calculate the minimum number of screens required, considering the optimal placement of both types of icons.
