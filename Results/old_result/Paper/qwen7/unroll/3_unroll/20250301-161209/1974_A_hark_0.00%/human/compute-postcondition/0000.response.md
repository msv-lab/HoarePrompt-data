Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning this integer value to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid after the code execution, but now `t` specifically holds the value entered by the user.
