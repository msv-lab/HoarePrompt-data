Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic within `func_2` is flawed. 

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Mixed Icons**: The formula used to calculate the number of screens for mixed icons (both 1x1 and 2x2) is incorrect. The current implementation subtracts `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` from `x`, which is not aligned with the grid constraints. For example, placing a 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, but the remaining space calculation should consider how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle the placement of 1x1 icons optimally after placing 2x2 icons. For instance, if there are 15 1x1 icons and 2 2x2 icons, the program might not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:

- **Input**: `15 2`
- **Expected Output**: `2` (since we can place 2 2x2 icons on one screen and the remaining 11 1x1 icons on another screen).
- **Actual Output**: The program might output `1` or `3` depending on the incorrect logic.

To fix this, a more detailed and accurate approach is needed to calculate the minimum number of screens required, considering the optimal placement of both types of icons.
