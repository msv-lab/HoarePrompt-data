Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on specific conditions involving two favorite integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. The solution involves two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` to compute the results.
4. `func_1` iterates through each element of the array, calculates the remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\), and uses a frequency dictionary to count pairs that satisfy the conditions for being a "beautiful pair."
5. The logic within `func_1` correctly implements the conditions for a pair to be considered "beautiful":
   - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
   - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
6. The implementation in both functions matches the problem statement and the provided examples. The output produced by the functions aligns with the expected results.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
