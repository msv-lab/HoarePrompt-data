### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in an array such that:
   - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
   - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary (`freq`) to keep track of the occurrences of remainders when elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element \(a\) in the array, it computes the required remainders and checks if they exist in the frequency dictionary to increment the count of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic used to compute the remainders and check for pairs is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and passes the test cases to `func_1`.
   - It correctly parses the input and constructs the test cases in the required format.
   - The function then calls `func_1` and prints the results, which is also correct.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - The logic in both functions collectively meets the requirements of the problem.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
