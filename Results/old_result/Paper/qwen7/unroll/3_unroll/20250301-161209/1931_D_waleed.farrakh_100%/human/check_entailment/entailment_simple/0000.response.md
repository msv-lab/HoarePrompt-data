Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes it into a format suitable for the main computation.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the number of beautiful pairs according to the given conditions. It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the remainders when each element of the array is divided by `x` and `y`. This approach ensures that we efficiently count pairs that satisfy both conditions.
3. The logic within `func_1` is sound and follows the problem statement accurately. It iterates through the array, computes the necessary remainders, and updates the count of beautiful pairs based on the frequency dictionary.
4. The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input, processing each test case, and calling `func_1` to compute the results.
5. The final output is correctly printed for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
