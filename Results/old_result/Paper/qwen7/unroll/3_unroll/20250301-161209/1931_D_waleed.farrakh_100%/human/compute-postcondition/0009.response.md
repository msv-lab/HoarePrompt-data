Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `result`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `result`**: The loop iterates over the elements of `results`. Therefore, `result` will take on each value in `results` during each iteration.

3. **Analyze the given state before the loop**:
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input along line breaks.
   - `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer.
   - `test_cases` is a list containing tuples of integers where each tuple consists of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.
   - `idx` is equal to `t * 2 + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `results`. We need to ensure that `results` is a non-empty list because if `results` is empty, the loop will not execute.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `results` must be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`results` is a non-empty list**.
