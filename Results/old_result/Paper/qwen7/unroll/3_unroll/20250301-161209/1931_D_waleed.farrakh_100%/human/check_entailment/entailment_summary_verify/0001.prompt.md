You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) sets of inputs. Each set includes integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list \( arr \) of \( n \) integers. It calls another function `func_1` with the collected test cases and prints the results returned by `func_1`. The final state of the program includes the console output of the results for all test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - For each test case, initialize `freq` (a dictionary to store frequency of remainders) and `count` (to store the number of beautiful pairs).

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, compute the remainders when `a` is divided by `x` and `y`.
   - Compute `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` to ensure `rx` is non-negative.
   - Compute `ry = a % y`.
   - Check if `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add the count from `freq[rx, ry]` to `count`.
   - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Return the results**:
   - Append the final `count` to `results` and return `results`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Split the input into lines.
   - Parse the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, parse `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Append the parsed test case to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Call `func_1` with `test_cases` and store the results.
   - Print each result from `results`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative, which is necessary because negative remainders could lead to incorrect counts.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct. For each element `a`, we check if there are any previous elements that form a beautiful pair with `a`.
   - The use of remainders helps in efficiently finding pairs that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the entire input at once and processes it correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as large arrays and multiple test cases correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic for finding beautiful pairs is correct, and the input handling is also correct. Therefore, the given program should work as expected based on the problem description.
