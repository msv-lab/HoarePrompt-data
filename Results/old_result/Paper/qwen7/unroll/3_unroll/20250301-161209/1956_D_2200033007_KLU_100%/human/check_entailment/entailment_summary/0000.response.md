### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array elements using up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting a contiguous subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
   - The goal is to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function computes the maximum sum achievable for a subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`. It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **func_2**: This function determines the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`. It recursively breaks down the subarray into smaller parts and constructs the operations.
   - **make_stairs**: This function sets a portion of the array to form a "stair" pattern, ensuring that the MEX value is correctly applied to maximize the sum.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the maximum sum by considering all possible ways to split the subarray and applying the MEX value.
   - The `func_2` function correctly identifies the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum by recursively breaking down the subarray and applying the results of `func_1`.
   - The `make_stairs` function correctly sets the array to form a "stair" pattern, ensuring that the MEX value is applied correctly.

4. **Validation**:
   - The provided examples show that the functions work as intended:
     - Example 1: The array `[0, 1]` is transformed to `[2, 2]` with a sum of 4.
     - Example 2: The array `[1, 3, 9]` remains unchanged as it already maximizes the sum.
     - Example 3: The array `[1, 100, 2, 1]` is transformed to `[1, 100, 2, 2]` with a sum of 105.
     - Example 4: The array `[0]` is transformed to `[1]` with a sum of 1.

Given that the functions correctly compute the maximum sum and the necessary operations for each example, and the logic aligns with the problem requirements, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
