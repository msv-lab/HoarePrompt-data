The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, and returns a list based on certain conditions. If the length of the sublist from `start_index` to `end_index` is 1 and the element at `start_index` is 0, it returns an empty list. If the maximum value in the sublist equals the square of its length, it returns a list containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with adjusted `start_index` and `end_index` values based on conditions involving the elements of the sublist and the result of another function `func_1`. The function ultimately returns one of five possible outcomes: an empty list, a list containing a single tuple `(0, 0)`, a list containing a tuple `(start_index, end_index)`, the result of a recursive call with `start_index + 1` and `end_index`, or the result of a recursive call with `start_index` and `end_index - 1`.
