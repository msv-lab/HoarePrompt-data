Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations where you can choose a subarray and set all its elements to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray. The operations can be performed up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(start_index, end_index)**: This function computes the maximum possible sum for the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` using dynamic programming with memoization. It considers different ways to partition the subarray and calculates the sum for each partition.
   - **func_2(start_index, end_index)**: This function determines the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`. It recursively finds the optimal subarrays and constructs the sequence of operations.
   - **make_stairs(i)**: This function is intended to create a "staircase" pattern in the array, setting elements to their respective indices. However, the provided code does not seem to fully implement this functionality as described in the problem statement.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The core logic for computing the maximum sum (`func_1`) seems correct and follows the problem constraints.
   - The function `func_2` aims to find the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. However, the implementation of `make_stairs` is incomplete and may not correctly generate the necessary operations.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The `make_stairs` function is not fully implemented and does not appear to correctly set the elements of the array to form a staircase pattern.
   - The recursive calls in `func_2` might not always find the correct subarrays to maximize the sum, leading to potential incorrect results.

Given these points, while the core logic for computing the maximum sum appears to be correct, the implementation of the operations to achieve this sum is incomplete and potentially flawed. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed.

Correctness: **False**
