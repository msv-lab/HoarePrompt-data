Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, `res` is a list containing one tuple (start_index, start_index), and the current value of i is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to the list `res`. Since `start_index` is a non-negative integer and the list `res` was initially empty, after appending the tuple, `res` now contains one element, which is the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
