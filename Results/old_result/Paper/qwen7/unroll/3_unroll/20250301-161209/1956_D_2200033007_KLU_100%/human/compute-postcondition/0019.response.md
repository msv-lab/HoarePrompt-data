Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, `res` is a list containing one tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is initially equal to 0, the tuple added to `res` is `(start_index, start_index + 0)`, which simplifies to `(start_index, start_index)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
