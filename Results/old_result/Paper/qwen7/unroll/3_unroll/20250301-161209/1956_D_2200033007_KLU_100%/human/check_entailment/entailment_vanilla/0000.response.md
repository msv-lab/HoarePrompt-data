Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function aims to calculate the maximum sum of the subarrays using a recursive approach. However, the logic and implementation seem flawed for several reasons:

1. **Recursive Approach**: The function uses recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems. However, the base case and recursive case do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the function is trying to maximize the sum of subarrays, but it does not handle the operation of setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX value correctly.

2. **Incorrect Base Case**: The base case `if start_index == end_index:` returns `max(1, arr[start_index])`, which is not relevant to the problem since we want to maximize the sum, and setting the element to 1 might not be optimal.

3. **Recursive Case**: The recursive case is trying to find the maximum sum by considering different splits of the array, but it does not account for the MEX operation correctly. The current implementation does not update the array elements to their MEX values, which is crucial for maximizing the sum.

4. **Memoization**: The memoization dictionary `res_dict` is used, but the logic inside the function does not correctly update the array elements to their MEX values, making the memoization ineffective.

#### Function `func_2`
This function is supposed to generate the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. However, it also seems flawed:

1. **Max Value Calculation**: The function calculates the maximum value (`max_value`) using `func_1`, which is already flawed as explained above.

2. **Operation Generation**: The function tries to generate operations based on the maximum value, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. It attempts to create "staircases" of increasing values, but this approach is overly complex and does not guarantee the correct solution.

3. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_2` do not correctly reflect the MEX operation and the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

#### Function `make_stairs`
This function is intended to create a staircase pattern in the array, but it is not used correctly within the context of the problem. It does not align with the requirement to maximize the sum by performing the MEX operation on subarrays.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. They do not handle the MEX operation and the sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
