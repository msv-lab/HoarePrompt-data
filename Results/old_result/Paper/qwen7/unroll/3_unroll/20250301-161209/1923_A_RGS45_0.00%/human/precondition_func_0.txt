t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing whether the corresponding cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
