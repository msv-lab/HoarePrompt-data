Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(t)`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - We know that `t` is an input integer, meaning `t` is already defined before the loop starts.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop `for i in range(t)` to execute, `t` must be at least 1 (since `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `t` is the only variable that affects the loop execution, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.
   - `i` will be automatically set to 0 by the loop when it starts executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
