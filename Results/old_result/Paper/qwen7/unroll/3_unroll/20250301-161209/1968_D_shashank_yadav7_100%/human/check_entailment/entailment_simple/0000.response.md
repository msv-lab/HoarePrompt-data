Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for each test case, including the number of test cases `t`, the size of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, and the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`. These values are stored appropriately.

2. **Permutation and Array Construction**: The program constructs the permutation `p` and the array `a` correctly using the `map` function and list comprehension.

3. **Position Adjustment**: The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing, which is necessary for array indexing in Python.

4. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the initial scores for Bodya (`sp`) and Sasha (`bp`). It also initializes the maximum possible scores for both players (`bm` and `sm`).

5. **Game Loop**: The program enters a loop that simulates the game for `k` turns. In each iteration:
   - It updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation.
   - It updates the maximum possible scores for both players, considering the current position and the remaining turns.
   - It updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by adding the value of the current position.

6. **Result Determination**: After the loop, the program compares the maximum possible scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

7. **Output**: The program outputs the results for each test case as required.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
