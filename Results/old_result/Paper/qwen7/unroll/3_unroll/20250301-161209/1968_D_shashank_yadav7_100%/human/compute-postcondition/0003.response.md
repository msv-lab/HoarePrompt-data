Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines, each line representing the result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case after executing the loop. For each test case, the loop updates the maximum values `bm` and `sm`, and prints 'Bodya' if `bm` is greater than `sm`, 'Sasha' if `bm` is less than `sm`, and 'Draw' if they are equal.
