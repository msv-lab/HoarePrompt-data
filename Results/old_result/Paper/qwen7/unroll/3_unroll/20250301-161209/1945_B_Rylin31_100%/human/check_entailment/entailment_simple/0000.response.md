Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula \( \text{m} // \text{a} + \text{m} // \text{b} + 2 \). However, this formula is incorrect for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. The number of fireworks visible at any given time is determined by how many multiples of \(a\) and \(b\) fit within the visibility period \(m+1\), plus the overlap at the LCM point.

The given formula \( \text{m} // \text{a} + \text{m} // \text{b} + 2 \) does not account for the overlapping fireworks correctly. It simply counts the number of multiples of \(a\) and \(b\) up to \(m\) and adds 2 (which is incorrect for the LCM logic).

Given the example in the problem, the correct solution should involve calculating the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) and then determining the number of fireworks visible at the LCM interval.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
