Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula used in the program, `m // a + m // b + 2`, is incorrect for this problem. This formula would give the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`, but it does not account for the overlapping times when fireworks from both installations coincide.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval at which fireworks from both installations coincide. Then, we can calculate how many such intervals fit into the visibility period `m` plus the initial fireworks launched immediately after turning on the installations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of intervals of lcm_ab that fit into m
        intervals = m // lcm_ab
        # Add the initial fireworks launched immediately after turning on the installations
        max_fireworks = intervals * 2 + 2
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the least common multiple (LCM) to find the interval at which fireworks from both installations coincide and then calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously.
