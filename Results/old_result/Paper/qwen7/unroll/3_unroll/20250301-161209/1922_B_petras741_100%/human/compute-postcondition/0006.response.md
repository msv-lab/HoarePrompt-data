Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list a containing n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. The function processes these inputs and returns some form of output for each test case, though the specific nature of the output is not detailed here.
