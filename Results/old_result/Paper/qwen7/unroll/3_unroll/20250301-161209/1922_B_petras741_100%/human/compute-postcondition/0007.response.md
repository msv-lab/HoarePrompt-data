Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer t (number of cases), an integer n (size of the list), and a list a of n non-negative integers. It calculates and prints the number of specific triplets that can be formed based on the frequency of elements in the list. If n is less than 3, it prints 0. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
