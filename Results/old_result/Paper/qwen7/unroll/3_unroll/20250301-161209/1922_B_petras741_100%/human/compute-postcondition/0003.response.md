Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `buffer` is an empty list, but this variable is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 (the starting value) and `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `t` must be greater than 0 (which is already given as \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)).

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
