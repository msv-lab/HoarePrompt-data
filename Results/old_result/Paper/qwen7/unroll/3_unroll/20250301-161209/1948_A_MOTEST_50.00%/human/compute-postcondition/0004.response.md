Output State: t is an input integer, n varies based on user input within the range of 1 to 50, s is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet, after all iterations, the loop prints 'YES' followed by a string 'ans'. If n is even, 'ans' is constructed by taking two characters from 's' sequentially until half of 'n', and if n is odd, 'ans' starts with 'AAA' followed by the rest constructed similarly. The final state will have 't' lines of output, each starting with 'YES' followed by the corresponding 'ans' string for each input 'n'.
