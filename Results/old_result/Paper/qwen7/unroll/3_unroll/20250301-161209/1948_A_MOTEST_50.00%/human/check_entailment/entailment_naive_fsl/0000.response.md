Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the string should have exactly one character that appears three times, and all other characters should appear twice. However, the program only handles the case where `n` is even by appending pairs of characters. For odd `n`, the program does not ensure that there is exactly one character appearing three times and the rest appearing twice.

For example, consider `n = 3`. The correct output should be a string like "AAA" or "BBB", but the program will generate a string like "AAAB" which has two characters appearing three times instead of one. This violates the requirement that there must be exactly one character that appears three times.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `3`
- Expected Output: `YES\nAAA`
- Actual Output: The program might output something like `YES\nAAAB` which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
