Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet.**

The code initializes the variable `s` with the uppercase English alphabet, which is a constant string. This does not affect the values of `t` and `n`. Therefore, their constraints remain the same.
