Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
2. Each move can either add or remove one cube, which means the difference between the final number of cubes (`m`) and the initial number of cubes (0) must be an even number if we consider only additions and subtractions of 1.
3. The provided program defines a function `func_1()` that takes two integers `n` and `m`, checks if `(n - m)` is non-negative and even, and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
4. This logic correctly determines whether it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves because:
   - If `(n - m)` is even, it means the number of additions equals the number of removals, which is possible within `n` moves.
   - If `(n - m)` is odd or negative, it's impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
