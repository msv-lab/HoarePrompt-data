Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`kreker`) and then processes each test case using the `func_1()` function.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, meaning that the number of moves to add cubes is at least as many as the number of cubes needed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. Here, `n - m = -2`, which satisfies both conditions `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. However, it is impossible to end up with 4 cubes after 2 moves because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. This indicates that the current implementation is flawed.

### Correctness of the Program

The original assessment is correct. The program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for the case `n = 2` and `m = 4` because it does not account for the fact that the number of moves must be sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes. Specifically, the difference `n - m` should also be non-negative, ensuring that there are enough moves to add the required number of cubes.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle the cases where `n` is less than `m`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
