Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a sequence of strings. Specifically, it always prints "1 1" and "1 2". If `n` equals 3, it prints "2 3"; otherwise, it prints "2 4" followed by a sequence of strings where each string contains an integer `j` from 4 to `n`, paired with itself. After processing all `t` test cases, the function does not return any value.**
