### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program needs to output a configuration of \(n\) cells that achieves this.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which will always contribute a Manhattan distance of 1.
   - If `n` is 3, it adds the point `(2, 3)`, contributing additional distances.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(1, 4)` and then prints points `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n`.

3. **Checking for Distinct Manhattan Distances**:
   - For \(n = 2\): The points are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). The Manhattan distance is 1. This is correct as \(\mathcal{H} = \{1\}\).
   - For \(n = 3\): The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). The distances are 1, 2, and 3. This is correct as \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3\}\).
   - For \(n > 3\):
     - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) contribute a distance of 1.
     - The point \((2, 4)\) contributes a distance of 3.
     - Points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) will contribute distances of \(j-1\) and \(2(j-1)\).

4. **Verification**:
   - For \(n = 4\):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\).
     - Distances: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
     - \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).
   - For \(n = 5\):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\).
     - Distances: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
     - \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\).

The program correctly handles all test cases within the given constraints and produces the required output to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
