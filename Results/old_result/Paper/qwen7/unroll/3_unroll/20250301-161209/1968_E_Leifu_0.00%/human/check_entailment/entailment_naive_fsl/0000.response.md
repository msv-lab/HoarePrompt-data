Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n > 3\). Specifically, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs the following coordinates:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
4 5
```
However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 4\) should include cells that maximize the Manhattan distances. A better arrangement could be:
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
This arrangement results in the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which has a size of 4. The program's output for \(n = 4\) only achieves a set size of 3, which is suboptimal.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\), making it incorrect.
