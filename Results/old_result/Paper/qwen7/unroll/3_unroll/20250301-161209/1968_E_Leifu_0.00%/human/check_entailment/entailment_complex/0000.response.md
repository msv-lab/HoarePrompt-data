Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for a given \(n\).
2. The annotated program attempts to generate a set of points that might maximize \(\mathcal{H}\), but it does not cover all possible values of \(n\) effectively.
3. Let's analyze the program's output for different values of \(n\):
   - For \(n = 2\): The output is "1 1", "1 2". This only gives two points, resulting in a maximum \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.
   - For \(n = 3\): The output is "1 1", "1 2", "2 3". This gives three points, resulting in a maximum \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which is correct.
   - For \(n = 4\): The output is "1 1", "1 2", "2 4", "4 4", "4 5". This gives four points, but the maximum \(\mathcal{H}\) should include distances like 3, which are missing. A better configuration would be "1 1", "1 2", "2 1", "2 3", "4 3", "4 4".
   - For \(n = 5\): The output is "1 1", "1 2", "2 4", "4 4", "4 6". Again, this does not cover all possible distances. A better configuration would be similar to the one mentioned above for \(n = 4\).
   - For \(n = 6\): The output is "1 1", "1 2", "2 4", "4 4", "4 7". This also does not cover all possible distances. A better configuration would be similar to the ones mentioned above.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n > 3\).

Correctness: **False**
