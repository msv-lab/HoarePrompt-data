Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing through predefined variables t, n, and a, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5 (inclusive), and a is a list of n integers each between 1 and n (inclusive). The function processes these variables and returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts `t`, `n`, and `a` as inputs, where `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the list for each test case, and `a` is the list itself containing integers. The function then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a result.
