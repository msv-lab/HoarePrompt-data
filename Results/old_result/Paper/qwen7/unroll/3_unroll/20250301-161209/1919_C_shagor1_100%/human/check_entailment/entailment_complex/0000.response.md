Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\). Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually. This is handled correctly with the loop `while t:`.

2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself. This is done correctly using `n = int(input())` and `(*inp,) = map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Penalty Calculation Logic**:
   - The variables `la` and `lb` are initialized to \(n+1\), which ensures they are greater than any possible value in the array since \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the penalty.
   - The loop iterates through each element in the array `inp`.
     - If the current element \(i\) is less than or equal to `la`, it updates `la` to \(i\). This means that if we place the current element in subsequence \(s\), it won't increase the penalty because it maintains the non-decreasing order.
     - If the current element \(i\) is greater than `la` but less than or equal to `lb`, it updates `lb` to \(i\). This means that if we place the current element in subsequence \(t\), it won't increase the penalty because it maintains the non-decreasing order.
     - If the current element \(i\) is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it means placing the current element in either subsequence would increase the penalty. Therefore, it sets `la` to `lb` and updates `lb` to \(i\), and increments `ans` by 1. This ensures that the penalty is minimized by always trying to maintain the non-decreasing order in one of the subsequences.

4. **Output**: After processing all elements in the array, it prints the accumulated penalty `ans` and decrements `t` to move to the next test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
