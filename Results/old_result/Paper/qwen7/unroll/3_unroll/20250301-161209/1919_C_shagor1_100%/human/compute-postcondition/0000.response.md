Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i; the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `pass` does nothing and simply moves execution to the next line without changing any variable values or performing any operations. Therefore, all the conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.
