Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `p` of `n` integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct). For each test case, it reads an additional integer `x`, then checks if any element `l[i]` in a list of length `x` satisfies the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an element exists, it prints "2"; otherwise, it prints "3". The function does not return any value but outputs either "2" or "3" for each test case based on the specified condition.**
