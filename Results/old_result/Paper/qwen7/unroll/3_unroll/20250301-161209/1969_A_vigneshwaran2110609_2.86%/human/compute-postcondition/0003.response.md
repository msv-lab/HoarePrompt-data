Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. After the loop executes all the iterations, the output consists of either "2" or "3" printed for each iteration based on the condition inside the inner loop. If for any iteration, the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met, "2" is printed; otherwise, "3" is printed for that iteration.
