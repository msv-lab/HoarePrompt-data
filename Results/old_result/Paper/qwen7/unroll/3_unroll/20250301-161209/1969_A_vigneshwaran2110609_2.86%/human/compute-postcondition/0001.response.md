Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head consists of the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all `p_i` are distinct.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 because the `range(n)` function generates values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `n` should remain as given since it is an input parameter and its value is already known.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` should remain within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

The final state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive**
