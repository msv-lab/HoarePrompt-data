Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where no pair of friends can form a valid invitation pair. For example, in the input:

```
2
2 1
```

The program will incorrectly output `2`, but according to the problem description, Monocarp needs to send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the program does not check this scenario properly. It only checks if there exists a friend whose best friend also receives an invitation and prints `2` immediately, which is incorrect for the given example. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
