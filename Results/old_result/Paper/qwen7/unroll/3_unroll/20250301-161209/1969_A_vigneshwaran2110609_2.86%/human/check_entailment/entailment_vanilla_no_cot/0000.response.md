Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func` is not correctly handling the input structure. It expects the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p` in a single loop, but it should handle each test case separately.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside the function is flawed. It checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, which is not relevant to the problem. This condition checks if a friend is their own best friend, which is not the case here (since `p_i ≠ i`).

3. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**: The function does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. It assumes that finding a pair where `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` will always be sufficient, which is not true.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        # Create a graph representation
        graph = {i + 1: p[i] for i in range(n)}
        
        # Check for direct pairs
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if graph[graph[i]] == i:
                results.append(2)
                break
        else:
            # If no direct pair found, check for indirect pairs
            visited = set()
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                if i not in visited:
                    cycle = set()
                    while i not in cycle:
                        cycle.add(i)
                        i = graph[i]
                        if i in visited:
                            break
                    if len(cycle) >= 2:
                        results.append(len(cycle))
                        break
            else:
                # If no suitable cycle is found, we need to invite everyone
                results.append(n)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This solution correctly handles multiple test cases and calculates the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
