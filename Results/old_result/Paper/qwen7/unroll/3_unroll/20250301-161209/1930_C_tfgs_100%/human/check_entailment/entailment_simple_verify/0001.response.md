### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the array `a` is modified by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is correct as per the problem statement.
   - The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each value in `a`, but this is unnecessary since we only need the unique values and their order.
   - The program converts `a` to a set to get unique values, sorts them in reverse order, and then processes these values to form the final array `b`.

3. **Constructing the Final Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique values and constructs the array `b` by ensuring the maximum possible values while maintaining the constraints.
   - It handles the case where there are remaining elements to be added to `b` by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final array `b` in the required format.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Step 1: Reading Input
- Correctly reads `t`, `n`, and `a`.

#### Step 2: Processing Each Test Case
- Modifies `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element. This is correct.
- Converts `a` to a set to get unique values. This is unnecessary since we only need the unique values, but the sorting and processing logic still works.
- Sorts the unique values in reverse order. This is correct.

#### Step 3: Constructing the Final Array `b`
- The main issue lies in how the program constructs `b`. Let's break down the logic:
  - The program iterates through the sorted unique values and tries to construct `b` by ensuring the highest possible values are placed first.
  - It calculates the difference between consecutive elements and decrements the count accordingly.
  - However, the logic for decrementing `cur` and `cnt` might not always produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the example provided:
  - **Test Case 1:** `a = [2, 1]`
    - After modification: `a = [3, 2]`
    - Unique values: `[3, 2]`
    - Sorted in reverse: `[3, 2]`
    - Constructing `b`:
      - First iteration: `a[0] = 3`, append `3` to `ans`, `cnt = 1`, `cur = 1`
      - Second iteration: `a[1] = 2`, append `2` to `ans`, `cnt = 0`, `cur = 0`
    - Final `b`: `[3, 2]`

- **Test Case 2:** `a = [1, 100, 1000, 1000000, 1000000000]`
  - After modification: `a = [2, 101, 1001, 1000001, 1000000001]`
  - Unique values: `[1000000001, 1000001, 1001, 101, 2]`
  - Sorted in reverse: `[1000000001, 1000001, 1001, 101, 2]`
  - Constructing `b`:
    - First iteration: `a[0] = 1000000001`, append `1000000001` to `ans`, `cnt = 4`, `cur = 1`
    - Second iteration: `a[1] = 1000001`, append `1000001` to `ans`, `cnt = 3`, `cur = 1`
    - Third iteration: `a[2] = 1001`, append `1001` to `ans`, `cnt = 2`, `cur = 1`
    - Fourth iteration: `a[3] = 101`, append `101` to `ans`, `cnt = 1`, `cur = 1`
    - Fifth iteration: `a[4] = 2`, append `2` to `ans`, `cnt = 0`, `cur = 1`
  - Final `b`: `[1000000001, 1000001, 1001, 101, 2]`

- **Test Case 3:** `a = [6, 4, 8]`
  - After modification: `a = [7, 5, 9]`
  - Unique values: `[9, 7, 5]`
  - Sorted in reverse: `[9, 7, 5]`
  - Constructing `b`:
    - First iteration: `a[0] = 9`, append `9` to `ans`, `cnt = 2`, `cur = 1`
    - Second iteration: `a[1] = 7`, append `7` to `ans`, `cnt = 1`, `cur = 1`
    - Third iteration: `a[2] = 5`, append `5` to `ans`, `cnt = 0`, `cur = 1`
  - Final `b`: `[9, 7, 5]`

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for decrementing `cur` and `cnt` might not always produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.
- The program does not handle the case where the differences between consecutive elements are not sufficient to fill the required number of elements in `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the lexicographically largest array `b` due to the issues identified in the construction logic.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
