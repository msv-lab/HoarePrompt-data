Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 10^4] is still valid. The new variable `n` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is guaranteed to be within the range [1, 3 ⋅ 10^5].
