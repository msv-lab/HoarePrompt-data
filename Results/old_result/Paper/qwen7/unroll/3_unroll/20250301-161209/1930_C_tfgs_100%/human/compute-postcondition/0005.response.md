Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list `a`.**

The code `counter = Counter(a)` creates a `Counter` object named `counter` that counts the frequency of each element in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
