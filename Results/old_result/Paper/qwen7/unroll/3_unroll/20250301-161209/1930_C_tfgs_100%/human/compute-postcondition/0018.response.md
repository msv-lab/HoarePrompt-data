Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` for each test case. It first increments each element in the list by its index plus one. Then, it creates a list `ans` containing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted unique list of `a`, up to a length of `n`. It adjusts the values in `ans` based on the count of each element in the original list `a`. Finally, it prints the adjusted list `ans`.**
