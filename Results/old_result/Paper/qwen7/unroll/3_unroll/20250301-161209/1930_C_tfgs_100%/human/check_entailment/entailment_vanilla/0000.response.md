Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the array `a` is modified by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is correct as per the problem statement.
   - The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each value in `a`, but this is unnecessary since we only need the unique values and their order.
   - The program converts `a` to a set to get unique values, sorts them in reverse order, and then processes these values to form the final array `b`.

3. **Constructing the Final Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique values and constructs the array `b` by ensuring the maximum possible values while maintaining the constraints.
   - It handles the case where there are remaining elements to be added to `b` by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final array `b` in the required format.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements

- **Unique Elements in Set `S`:**
  - The program correctly ensures that each element is unique when constructing the set `S`.

- **Lexicographically Largest Array `b`:**
  - The program aims to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` by ensuring the highest possible values are placed first and handling remaining elements appropriately.

- **Handling Remaining Elements:**
  - The program correctly handles the remaining elements by appending the last value minus one for the required number of times, ensuring the lexicographical order is maintained.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` as per the problem statement. There are no logical errors or omissions that would lead to incorrect results.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
