State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each unique element in the list `a` before sorting, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` is being used in the `range(len(a))` function, which means `i` will iterate from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
2. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so these are the only variables that need to be adjusted.
3. At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 0 because the loop will start iterating from the first element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial value of `i` as 0, while keeping all other variables unchanged.
