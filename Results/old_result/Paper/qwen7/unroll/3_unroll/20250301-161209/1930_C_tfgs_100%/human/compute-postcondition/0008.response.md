Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each unique element in the list `a` before sorting.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The other variables (`cur`, `t`, `n`, and `counter`) remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains its elements sorted from highest to lowest.
