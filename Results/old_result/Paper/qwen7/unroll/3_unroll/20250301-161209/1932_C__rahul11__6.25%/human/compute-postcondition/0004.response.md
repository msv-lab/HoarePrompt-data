Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n and m (both integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), an array a (a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and a string s (a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input according to the given constraints.**
