Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `N + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 (since `range(N + 1)` generates values from 0 to N).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to 0 initially.
   - `N` should be set to the value of `n` from the given state.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
- `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that \(1 \leq l < r \leq n\).
- `nums` is a list of integers with its last element being -1.
- `s` is 0.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the first element of `nums`.
- `arr` is an empty list.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `N`:
- `i` should be 0.
- `N` should be `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 0, `N` is `n`**
