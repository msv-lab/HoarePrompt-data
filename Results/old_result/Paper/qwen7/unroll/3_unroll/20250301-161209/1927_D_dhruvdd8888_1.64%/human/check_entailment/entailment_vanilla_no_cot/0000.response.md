Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is incomplete**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly. It should be called within the loop where the test cases are processed.

2. **Incorrect handling of queries**: The logic for processing queries is flawed. Specifically, the way the function handles the range `[l, r]` and finds indices `i` and `j` is incorrect. The current implementation does not correctly identify distinct elements within the specified range for each query.

3. **Unnecessary variables and imports**: Some imported modules like `math` and `heapq` are not used in the code, which can be removed for clarity and efficiency.

4. **Edge cases and debugging statements**: The debug statement `if ppp == 23:` is not necessary and can be removed. Additionally, the handling of edge cases in queries could be improved.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from bisect import *

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    for i in range(N):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i + 1
        num = nums[i]
    arr.append((s, N, num))  # Add the last segment
    LA = len(arr) - 1

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        (s, e, _) = arr[eli]
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the function `func_1` is called for each test case and handles the queries correctly by identifying distinct elements within the specified range.
