### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then processes each query to find a pair of different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`.

2. **Array Transformation:**
   - The program transforms the input array `nums` into a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple `(s, e, num)` represents the start (`s`), end (`e`), and value (`num`) of segments where the value changes.
   - This transformation helps in efficiently finding the first and last occurrence of a different value within any query range.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in `arr` that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks if the start of the found segment is greater than `l`, indicating that the segment starts before the query range.
   - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it prints the indices of the start and the next element in the segment.
   - If the end of the segment is less than `r`, it means the segment ends before the query range, so it prints `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment spans the entire range up to `N`, it also prints `-1 -1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the queried range consists of identical elements. For example, in the test case:
     ```
     5
     1 1 1 1 1
     1
     1 5
     ```
     The program correctly outputs `-1 -1`.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly identifies the segments and handles the binary search effectively.
   - The program ensures that it only outputs valid indices and `-1 -1` when no such pair exists.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that it only outputs valid pairs of indices or `-1 -1` when no such pair exists.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and handles all cases as required by the problem description.
