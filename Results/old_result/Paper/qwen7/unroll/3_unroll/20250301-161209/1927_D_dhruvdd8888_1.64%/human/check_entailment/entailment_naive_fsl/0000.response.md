Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no two different elements within the queried range. Specifically, the program assumes that there will always be a pair of different elements within the queried range, but this is not necessarily true. For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

In this case, the queried range is from index 1 to 5, and all elements in this range are the same (all are 1). The program will output `-1 -1`, which is correct according to the problem description. However, the program does not handle the case where there are no two different elements in the queried range properly. The program should check if such a pair exists before attempting to output indices. If no such pair exists, it should output `-1 -1`. The current implementation does not include this check, leading to potential issues in cases where the queried range consists of identical elements.
