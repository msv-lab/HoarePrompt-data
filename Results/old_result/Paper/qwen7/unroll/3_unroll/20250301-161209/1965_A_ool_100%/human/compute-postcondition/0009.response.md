Output State: `A` is True; `not_c` is False; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. The first element of `set_` is 1.

Explanation: The loop iterates through the elements of `set_` starting from the second element. If the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to False and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it toggles the value of `A`. Since the loop starts from index 1, the first comparison is `set_[1] - set_[0]`. If this condition is never met throughout the loop, `not_c` will remain True, but since we are told the first element of `set_` is 1, and assuming `set_` contains at least two elements, the difference between any two consecutive elements will not be greater than 1 (as they are sorted and unique). Therefore, the loop will complete without breaking, and `A` will be toggled based on the length of `set_`. If `set_` has an odd number of elements, `A` will end up being True (since it starts as False and is toggled an odd number of times), and if `set_` has an even number of elements, `A` will be False (toggled an even number of times). However, the problem does not specify the exact length of `set_`, so we can only definitively say `not_c` is False after the loop.
