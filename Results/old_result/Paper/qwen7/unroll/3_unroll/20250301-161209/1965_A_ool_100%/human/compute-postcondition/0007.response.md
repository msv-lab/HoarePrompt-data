Output State: **`A` is False; `not_c` is True; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. The first element of `set_` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `not_c = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `not_c`. The initial state of `A` and `set_` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the original values of `A` and `set_`, while `not_c` is updated to `True`.
