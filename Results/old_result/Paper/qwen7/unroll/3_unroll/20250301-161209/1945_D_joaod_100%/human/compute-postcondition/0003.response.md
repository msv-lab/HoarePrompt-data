Output State: The value of `t` after all iterations of the loop have finished, with `t` being updated based on the minimum cost calculated for each case provided by the input. For each case, the variable `best` holds the minimum cost to reach `pos_final` from `na_frente`, considering the costs of swapping and passing. After processing all cases, `t` reflects the cumulative effect of these minimum costs across all cases.
