Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and the initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
