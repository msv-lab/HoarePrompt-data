Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates through each test case.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes necessary variables like `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `total`. The positions are adjusted by subtracting 1 to match zero-based indexing.
3. **Dynamic Calculation**: The program uses a loop to iterate backward from `na_frente` to 0. For each position `v`, it checks if moving to or past `pos_final` is more cost-effective by comparing `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
4. **Cost Accumulation**: The cost is accumulated in the variable `total` and updated in the variable `best` to keep track of the minimum cost.
5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost (`best`) for each test case.

Given the provided execution summary, the program appears to follow the logic correctly and handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
