Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases (`cases`), the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`), and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`). It also correctly parses the lists of costs for swapping and passing (`custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`).

2. **Variable Adjustments**: The variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` are adjusted by subtracting 1, which is necessary because the indices in Python start from 0.

3. **Dynamic Calculation**: The program iterates backward through the list of people, calculating the minimum cost to reach the desired position (`pos_final`). This is done using a dynamic programming approach where it keeps track of the best cost (`best`) to reach each position.

4. **Cost Consideration**: The program correctly considers both the cost of swapping and the cost of passing for each person. It updates the total cost accordingly and ensures that the best cost is always maintained.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is stored in the variable `best`.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. There are no apparent errors or logical flaws in the code provided.

Correctness: **True**
