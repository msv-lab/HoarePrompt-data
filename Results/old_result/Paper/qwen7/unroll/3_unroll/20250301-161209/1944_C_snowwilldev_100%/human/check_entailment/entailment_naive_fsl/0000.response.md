Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`. To do this, she should try to append elements that will make it harder for Bob to minimize the MEX.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob aims to minimize the MEX of the array `c`. To do this, he should try to remove elements that will make it easier for him to achieve a lower MEX.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not simulate these strategies. Instead, it simply counts how many times each number appears in the array and returns the smallest number that either appears exactly once or has no occurrences. This approach does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their respective goals.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

- **Case 1**: The output should be `2`, but the program incorrectly outputs `0`.
- **Case 2**: The output should be `1`, but the program incorrectly outputs `0`.
- **Case 3**: The output should be `0`, but the program incorrectly outputs `0`.

To correctly simulate the game, the program needs to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and ensure that each player makes optimal moves. The current implementation does not handle this logic, leading to incorrect results.
