Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using the allowed number of queries. However, the logic in the code is flawed and does not guarantee finding the optimal pair of indices.

Here's why the solution is incorrect:

1. **First Loop**: The first loop tries to find the index `mak` where \(p_{mak}\) is the largest among the first \(n-1\) elements. This is not necessarily correct because it only checks against the current `mak` and doesn't consider the entire permutation.

2. **Second Loop**: The second loop tries to find another index `mak2` that maximizes the XOR with `mak`. It does this by comparing \(p_{mak} \mid p_{i}\) with \(p_{mak2} \mid p_{i}\) for all \(i\). However, this approach does not guarantee finding the optimal pair. For example, if the permutation is such that the highest XOR value involves indices that are not directly compared in this manner, the solution might miss it.

3. **Third Loop**: The third loop further refines the selection but still does not ensure that the optimal pair is found. It compares pairs within the selected set but does not consider the full permutation.

### Correct Approach:
A more effective strategy would involve a divide-and-conquer approach or a more systematic way of querying to ensure that all potential pairs are considered. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. **Divide-and-Conquer**: Divide the array into smaller segments and compare them using the allowed queries to narrow down the indices that could potentially give the maximum XOR.
2. **Systematic Querying**: Ensure that all pairs are systematically queried to avoid missing the optimal pair.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, a more sophisticated algorithm is needed to ensure correctness. The provided solution does not meet these requirements and thus is incorrect.
