Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic used in the program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously based on the given conditions.

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If \(m < a\) and \(m < b\), the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 because the next launch from either installation will occur after \(a\) or \(b\) minutes respectively, which is greater than \(m\).
   - **Case 2**: If \(m < a\) and \(m > b\), the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is \(2 + \frac{m}{b}\). This is because the next launch from the second installation will occur after \(b\) minutes, and the first launch from the first installation will occur after \(a\) minutes, which is greater than \(m\).
   - **Case 3**: If \(m < b\) and \(m > a\), the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is \(2 + \frac{m}{a}\). This is because the next launch from the first installation will occur after \(a\) minutes, and the first launch from the second installation will occur after \(b\) minutes, which is greater than \(m\).
   - **Case 4**: If \(m \geq a\) and \(m \geq b\), the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\). This is because both installations will have multiple launches within the visibility period \(m\), and the additional 2 accounts for the initial launches.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles the first three cases.
   - However, the fourth case is incorrectly handled. The formula \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\) does not account for the fact that the launches from both installations can overlap within the visibility period \(m\). Instead, the correct approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\) and then calculate how many launches fit into the visibility period \(m\).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example input `7 8 56`, the correct answer should be 17, but the program outputs 28645268630, which is incorrect. This indicates an error in the logic for the general case.

Given the above analysis, the program's logic for handling the general case is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
