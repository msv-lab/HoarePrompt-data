Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, a, and m for each test case, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}. For each value of t, it performs some operation using a, b, and m, and returns a result based on the operations.**

Note: The exact nature of the operations using `a`, `b`, and `m` is not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the general processing and return behavior based on the provided constraints.
