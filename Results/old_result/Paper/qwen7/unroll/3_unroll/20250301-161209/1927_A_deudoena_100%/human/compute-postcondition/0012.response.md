Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a string `s` within a predefined context where `t` (an integer between 1 and 10^4) and `n` (an integer between 1 and 10) are given, along with a string `s` consisting of `n` characters ('W' or 'B'). It returns the length of the string `s` minus the position of the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of the string, plus 2.**
