Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. The logic in `func_1` only considers the first and last black cells but does not account for the possibility that there might be multiple segments of black cells that need to be considered.

To fix this, the function should iterate through the string to find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells and then calculate the minimum segment length needed to cover any remaining black cells. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Find the longest segment of consecutive white cells
    max_white_segment = 0
    current_white_segment = 0
    for j in s:
        if j == 'W':
            current_white_segment += 1
        else:
            max_white_segment = max(max_white_segment, current_white_segment)
            current_white_segment = 0
    max_white_segment = max(max_white_segment, current_white_segment)

    # Calculate the minimum segment length needed to cover any remaining black cells
    min_segment_length = float('inf')
    start_black = -1
    end_black = -1
    for j in range(m):
        if s[j] == 'B':
            if start_black == -1:
                start_black = j
            end_black = j
    if start_black != -1:
        min_segment_length = min(min_segment_length, end_black - start_black + 1)
        if end_black < m - 1:
            min_segment_length = min(min_segment_length, m - 1 - start_black + 1)
        if start_black > 0:
            min_segment_length = min(min_segment_length, end_black - (start_black - 1) + 1)

    # Return the maximum of the longest white segment and the minimum segment length needed
    return max(max_white_segment, min_segment_length)
```

This corrected function properly calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.
