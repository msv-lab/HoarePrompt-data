Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `j`: This variable will take on each character from the reversed string `s` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `s`: This is the input string.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s` to iterate over. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `s` is not an empty string.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop will start when `s` is not empty, we need to ensure that `s` is non-empty. The other variables (`ma`, `mi`, `m`, `c`, `d`, and `l`) do not affect the loop's execution and can remain as they are.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `s` must be a non-empty string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list**
