Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Specifically, the program always adds 2 to the difference between `ma` and `mi`, which is incorrect. 

Consider the test case "WBBWBW". According to the problem description, the minimum length of the segment to be repainted white is 4. However, the program calculates `ma - mi + 2` which results in `4 - 1 + 2 = 5`. This is incorrect because painting the segment from the 2nd to the 5th cell (inclusive) is sufficient to make all cells white, so the correct answer should be 4.

To fix this, the program should simply return `ma - mi + 1` instead of `ma - mi + 2`.
