Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the appropriate arguments. Instead, it is called inside a loop where `i` is used as an index, but `i` is not passed as an argument to `func_1()`. This means the function will always receive `None` as its input, which is incorrect.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic in `func_1()` does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment needed to turn all cells white. Specifically:
   - It finds the position of the first 'B' from the start (`mi`) and the last 'B' from the end (`ma`).
   - It calculates `ma - mi + 2`, which is not the correct approach. The correct logic should find the minimum length of the segment starting from the first 'B' to the end of the string or from the beginning of the string to the last 'B'.

3. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input "WBBWBW", the expected output is 4. However, the function incorrectly calculates `len(s) - mi + 2` which results in 6 instead of 4.
   - For the input "BBW", the expected output is 2. The function correctly identifies the first 'B' at position 1 and the last 'B' at position 2, so the correct answer should be 2, but the function's logic does not account for the correct segment length.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
