Output State: **After all iterations, the variable `t` will remain unchanged, and for each input integer `x`, the final state of `s` will be a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The length of `s` will also be printed after processing each input, and it can vary from 30 to 31 based on the conditions inside the loop.**

This means that for each input integer `x`, the program processes its binary representation (padded to 30 bits), applies a series of transformations, and prints the resulting list of bits along with its length. The exact content of `s` and its length depend on the binary representation of `x` and the specific operations performed within the loop.
