Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Binary Representation:**
   - For each test case, it computes the binary representation of `x` using a loop from `0` to `29`.
   - If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, it appends `'1'` to the list `s`, otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting the Array:**
   - The program attempts to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to track if the last element was modified.
   - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it changes it to `'1'` and resets the flag.
   - If the current element and the next element are both `'1'`, it changes the current element to `'-'` and sets the flag.
   - After processing the entire list, it adjusts the last element if necessary to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the length of the array.
   - It prints the array itself.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling of Negative Elements:**
   - The program uses `'-'` to represent `-1`, but this is not a standard character in Python lists for integers. This will cause issues when trying to convert the list back to integers for the summation check.
   
2. **Logic for Ensuring No Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   - The logic for ensuring no consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. Specifically, the part where it changes `'1'` to `'0'` and `'-'` to `'1'` is incorrect because it doesn't maintain the original value of the bit.

3. **Length Calculation:**
   - The length calculation might be incorrect if the program needs to append a new element.

### Corrected Approach:

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, a simpler approach would be:
1. Compute the binary representation of `x`.
2. Ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements by iterating through the binary representation and making adjustments.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        
        # Compute binary representation
        while x > 0:
            s.append(x % 2)
            x //= 2
            length += 1
        
        # Adjust the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        for i in range(length - 1, 0, -1):
            if s[i] == 1 and s[i - 1] == 1:
                s[i] = 0
        
        # Print the length and the array
        print(length)
        print(*s)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
