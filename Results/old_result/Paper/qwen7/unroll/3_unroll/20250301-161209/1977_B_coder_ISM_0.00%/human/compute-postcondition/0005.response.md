Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into a binary representation of 30 bits and modifies this representation according to specific rules. It then prints the modified binary representation along with its length, which can be either 30 or 31. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
