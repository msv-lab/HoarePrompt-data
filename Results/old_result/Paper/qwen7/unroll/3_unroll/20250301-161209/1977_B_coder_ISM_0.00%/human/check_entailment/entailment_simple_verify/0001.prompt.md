You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: After all iterations, the variable `t` will remain unchanged, and for each input integer `x`, the final state of `s` will be a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The length of `s` will also be printed after processing each input, and it can vary from 30 to 31 based on the conditions inside the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Binary Representation:**
   - For each test case, it computes the binary representation of `x` using a loop from `0` to `29`.
   - If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, it appends `'1'` to the list `s`, otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting the Array:**
   - The program attempts to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to track if the last element was modified.
   - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it changes it to `'1'` and resets the flag.
   - If the current element and the next element are both `'1'`, it changes the current element to `'-'` and sets the flag.
   - After processing the entire list, it adjusts the last element if necessary to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the length of the array.
   - It prints the array itself.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling of Negative Elements:**
   - The program uses `'-'` to represent `-1`, but this is not a standard character in Python lists for integers. This will cause issues when trying to convert the list back to integers for the summation check.
   
2. **Logic for Ensuring No Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   - The logic for ensuring no consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. Specifically, the part where it changes `'1'` to `'0'` and `'-'` to `'1'` is incorrect because it doesn't maintain the original value of the bit.

3. **Length Calculation:**
   - The length calculation might be incorrect if the program needs to append a new element.

### Corrected Approach:

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, a simpler approach would be:
1. Compute the binary representation of `x`.
2. Ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements by iterating through the binary representation and making adjustments.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        
        # Compute binary representation
        while x > 0:
            s.append(x % 2)
            x //= 2
            length += 1
        
        # Adjust the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        for i in range(length - 1, 0, -1):
            if s[i] == 1 and s[i - 1] == 1:
                s[i] = 0
        
        # Print the length and the array
        print(length)
        print(*s)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
