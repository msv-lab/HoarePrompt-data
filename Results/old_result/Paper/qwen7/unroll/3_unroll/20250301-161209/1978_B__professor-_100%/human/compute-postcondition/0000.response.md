Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) are not yet defined and will be initialized later within each test case. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer is maintained, and now `t` holds the specific value read from the input.
