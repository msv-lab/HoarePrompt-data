Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Bob's profit. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Binary Search Usage**: The program uses binary search to find the optimal `k`, but the function `func_1` is incorrectly designed. It checks if the total profit (`ans`) is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not relevant to finding the maximum profit.

2. **Profit Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the profit but does not ensure that it maximizes the profit. Instead, it should directly calculate the profit for each `k` and keep track of the maximum profit.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The binary search is unnecessary for this problem since we can simply iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `n` and calculate the profit for each value to find the maximum profit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = 0
            if k > 0:
                profit += sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1))
            profit += (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This version iterates over all possible values of `k` and calculates the profit for each, then finds the maximum profit among them. This approach ensures that the program correctly determines the maximum profit Bob can obtain.
