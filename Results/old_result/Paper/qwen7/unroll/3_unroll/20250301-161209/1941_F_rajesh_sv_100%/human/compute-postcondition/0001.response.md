State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(testcases):`, which means the loop will iterate `testcases` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `testcases` must be greater than 0.
3. No other variables or states outside the loop head (`testcases`) need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `testcases` must be greater than 0.
