Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to her array `c`, then removes it from `a`. Bob picks an element directly from `a` and removes it. The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a`, including duplicates.
   - Bob can only pick elements that are still present in `a`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `cntl`.
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0` immediately, meaning there are no zeros in `a`, so the MEX will be `0`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`, which means Alice can ensure that the first two positions (0 and 1) are covered by her choices initially.
   - It then iterates through the rest of the elements to adjust `c` based on the availability of elements in `a`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice can always ensure that the first two positions (0 and 1) are covered by picking elements strategically.
   - Bob's strategy is to minimize the MEX, but since Alice can always pick elements to cover the first two positions, Bob cannot force the MEX to be greater than 2 unless there are specific constraints not handled by the current logic.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, the output is correct.
   - If `cntl[0]` is non-zero, the code correctly handles the first two positions and then checks the rest of the elements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code correctly implements the optimal strategies for both players based on the problem statement and the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
