Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob to achieve the highest possible MEX for Alice and the lowest possible MEX for Bob.
- The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game or calculate the MEX optimally.
- The logic in the code only considers the counts of elements in the array and does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
- Specifically, the code does not handle the alternating turns properly and does not ensure that the optimal strategy is applied for both players.
- The code assumes that the MEX can be determined solely by the counts of elements without considering the sequence of moves, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
