Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. Here’s why:

1. **Game Rules Not Fully Implemented**: 
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, and then delete it from `a`. However, the code only checks if there are any zeros in `a` and prints `0` if there are no zeros. This is not a complete simulation of the game.
   
2. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**:
   - The game involves strategic choices by both players to maximize or minimize the MEX of `c`. The current implementation does not account for the optimal moves by both players. It simply counts occurrences of elements and makes a few assumptions about the MEX value without considering the sequence of moves.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The logic to calculate the MEX is flawed. The code tries to determine the minimum number of elements needed to ensure a certain MEX value but does not fully simulate the game's turns and strategic choices.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game according to the rules and consider the optimal strategies for both players. Here’s a more accurate approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the occurrences of each element
        cnt = [0] * n
        for i in a:
            cnt[i] += 1
        
        # Determine the optimal MEX
        mex = 0
        while True:
            if cnt[mex] >= (1 + mex) // 2:
                mex += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

This approach considers the optimal moves by both players and calculates the MEX correctly by ensuring that the number of times an element appears in `c` does not exceed half the expected count for that MEX value.
