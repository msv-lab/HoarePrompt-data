### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing \((p_a \mid p_b)\) with \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Strategy Analysis**:
   - The provided solution starts by setting `maxi` to 0 and then iteratively checks if swapping `maxi` with another index `i` increases the result of \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\) compared to \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
   - If \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi}) < (p_i \mid p_i)\), it updates `maxi` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `maxi` holds the index with the highest value of \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\).

3. **Finding Potential Candidates**:
   - After determining the best candidate for `maxi`, the code then finds potential candidates for the second index by checking if \((p_{maxi} \mid p_i) < (p_{maxi} \mid p_j)\) for all \(i \neq j\).
   - It stores these candidates in the list `arr`.

4. **Final Comparison**:
   - The code then compares the potential candidates in `arr` to find the one that gives the maximum XOR value with `maxi`.
   - It prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the result.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The initial loop to find `maxi` uses \(n-1\) queries.
   - The loop to find potential candidates in `arr` uses approximately \(n-1\) queries.
   - The final comparison loop uses up to \(n-2\) queries.
   - Total queries: \( (n-1) + (n-1) + (n-2) = 3n - 4 \), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the permutation might be trivial (e.g., `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`).

However, upon closer inspection, there are issues with the logic used to find the potential candidates and the final comparison:

- **Issue 1**: The code sets `arr` to `[0]` initially and then appends new candidates only if they are equal to `maxi`. This means `arr` will only contain indices that give the same result as `maxi` when OR'ed with themselves. However, we need to consider all indices that maximize the XOR with `maxi`, not just those that give the same OR result.

- **Issue 2**: The final comparison loop only considers indices in `arr` that are greater than `mini` when OR'ed with themselves. This is not sufficient to ensure that the maximum XOR is found. We need to compare all indices in `arr` with `maxi` to find the one that gives the maximum XOR.

### Corrected Approach:
- Instead of setting `arr` to `[0]` and appending only equal OR results, we should store all indices that give a higher OR result.
- We need to compare all indices in `arr` with `maxi` to find the one that gives the maximum XOR.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        maxi = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = []
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', maxi, i, maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>' or res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected approach ensures that all potential candidates are considered and the maximum XOR is accurately found.

**Final: False**
