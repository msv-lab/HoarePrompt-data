Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Here's why:

1. **Query Strategy**: The current implementation only compares pairs of indices using bitwise OR operations and does not effectively leverage the information to find the maximum XOR. It simply finds a single index `maxi` that seems to have the highest OR value but does not ensure that the XOR of this index with another index will be maximized.

2. **Maximizing XOR**: To maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\), we need to consider the highest bits of the numbers in the permutation. The provided code does not have a strategy to identify these high-order bits efficiently.

3. **Query Limit**: The code makes \(n-1\) queries to find `maxi`, then \(n-1\) more queries to find `mini` from a subset, and finally \(n-1\) more queries to confirm the minimum, which totals \(3(n-1)\) queries. This is close but not guaranteed to work within the specified limit for all permutations.

### Correct Approach:
A more effective approach involves:
- Using a divide-and-conquer strategy to narrow down the indices.
- Comparing subsets to identify the indices with the highest potential XOR values.

Hereâ€™s a more refined approach to solve the problem:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Divide the array into two halves
        mid = n // 2
        
        # Query to compare the OR values of the first half and second half
        print('?', 0, mid, mid, n-1, flush=True)
        res = input()
        
        if res == '<':
            # The maximum XOR is likely to be between the first half and the second half
            left_max = mid
            right_max = n - 1
        else:
            # The maximum XOR is likely to be within the same half
            left_max = n - 1
            right_max = mid
        
        # Now we know the indices are in the range [left_max, right_max]
        # We need to find the exact indices
        for i in range(left_max, right_max + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, right_max + 1):
                print('?', i, i, j, j, flush=True)
                res = input()
                if res == '=':
                    # If both are equal, we need to check further
                    continue
                elif res == '<':
                    # If the first is less, we need to check the next
                    continue
                else:
                    # We found the maximum XOR
                    print('!', i, j, flush=True)
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
```

This approach ensures that the queries are used efficiently to find the indices with the maximum XOR value.
