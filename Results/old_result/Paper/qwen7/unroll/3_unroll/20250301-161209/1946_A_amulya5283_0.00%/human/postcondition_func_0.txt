The function accepts two parameters: `t`, the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples containing the length of an array and the array itself. For each test case, it sorts the array, identifies the median, and then performs operations to ensure all elements from the median index onwards are greater than the median. It counts the number of such operations needed for each test case and returns a list of these counts.
