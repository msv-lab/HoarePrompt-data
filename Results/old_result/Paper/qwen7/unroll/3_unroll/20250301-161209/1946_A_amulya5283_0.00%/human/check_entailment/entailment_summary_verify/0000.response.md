### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input into a string and splits it into tokens.
   - It then processes each test case by sorting the array and identifying the median.
   - It uses a min-heap to increment elements starting from the median index until all elements are greater than the median.

2. **Heap Usage:**
   - The program creates a heap from the elements starting from the median index.
   - It repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap.
   - This process continues until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The number of operations performed is counted and returned for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases.
- For each test case, it sorts the array, finds the median, and uses a heap to increment elements until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the median.
- It counts the number of operations needed and returns a list of these counts.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. This is accurate because the current approach does not guarantee the minimum number of operations.
- The provided test case examples demonstrate that the program's output is incorrect. For instance, in the first test case `[2, 2, 8, 2]`, the program incorrectly outputs `2` operations instead of `1`.

#### Correct Approach:
- To find the minimum number of operations, we need to consider the optimal sequence of operations. This involves identifying the elements that need to be incremented and performing the minimum number of operations to make the median greater.
- One efficient approach is to use a greedy strategy where we increment the smallest elements starting from the median index until the median is increased.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Therefore, the final evaluation should reflect this.

### Final:
**False**
