Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case consists of three non-negative integers (a, b, c) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, if the number of introverts (a) is within the range [1, 10^4] and the values of a, b, and c are all within the range [0, 10^9], the function returns information about the distribution of introverts, extroverts, and universals. If any of the constraints are not met, the function indicates an invalid input.**
