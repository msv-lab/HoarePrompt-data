Output State: `max_diff` is the minimum difference found between `left + f` and `D[l] + f` or `right - D[l] - f` for all `f` in `F`, `next_max_diff` remains the same as it was not affected by the loop, `index` remains unchanged as it was not updated within the loop, `left` and `right` remain the same as they were not updated within the loop, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.
