You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three lists: a (sorted list of integers), d, and f. For each test case, it calls another function `func_6()` which is not detailed here. After processing all test cases, it returns no value explicitly, but modifies the state of the lists a, d, and f as side effects.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the minimum imbalance after potentially adding one new problem.
   - The new problem's complexity is calculated as \(d_i + f_j\).
   - The imbalance is defined as the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list of problem complexities.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The program reads input data and processes it through several helper functions.
   - It uses a binary search approach (`bisect`) to efficiently find the optimal position for the new problem.

3. **Analysis of Functions**:
   - `func_1` and `wrapper`: These are unused and do not affect the program's functionality.
   - `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7`: These are utility functions for reading input.
   - `func_6` and `func_7`: These are placeholders and do not contribute to solving the problem directly.
   - `func_5`: Reads a single integer from input.
   - `func_4`: Reads multiple integers separated by spaces.
   - `func_2`: Reads a single line of input.
   - `func_7`: Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is in `func_6`.
   - It reads the number of problems, models, and functions.
   - It reads the list of problem complexities, models, and functions.
   - It calculates the current maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the second-largest difference (`next_max_diff`).
   - It iterates over all possible combinations of models and functions to find the best addition.
   - It uses binary search to find the optimal position for the new problem and updates the answer accordingly.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the current maximum difference and considers all possible additions.
   - The use of binary search ensures efficient computation.
   - The overall structure and logic appear correct based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implemented and follows the problem requirements accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
