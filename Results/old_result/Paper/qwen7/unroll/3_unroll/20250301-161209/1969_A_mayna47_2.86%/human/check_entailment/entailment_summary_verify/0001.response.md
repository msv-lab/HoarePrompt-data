### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Monocarp wants to invite friends to a party such that at least 2 friends come.
- Each friend has a best friend, and a friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
- We need to find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function `func_1()` initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` with all elements set to 0.
- It then maps the input values to this list.
- If `n == 2`, it prints `2`.
- Otherwise, it iterates through the list `v` to check a specific condition.
- If the condition is met, it prints `2` and returns.
- If the condition is not met, it prints `3`.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Input Handling**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `p` representing the best friends.

2. **Function Definition**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Variable Initialization**
   - The variable `v` is initialized with a length of `n + 1` and set to `[0]`, followed by mapping the input values to this list.
   - This step is unnecessary and incorrect. The list `v` should only be of length `n` and should directly map the input values without the initial `[0]`.

4. **Special Case Handling**
   - The special case for `n == 2` is handled correctly, printing `2` as the result.

5. **Main Logic**
   - The logic to check if at least two friends will come to the party is flawed.
     - The condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` checks if the friend `i` and their best friend's best friend's best friend is `i`. This does not necessarily mean that `i` and their best friend will both receive invitations.
     - The logic to print `2` when the condition is met is incorrect. It should check if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and then print `2`.
     - If no such pair is found, the logic incorrectly prints `3` without checking if sending invitations to any two friends would suffice.

6. **Output**
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

#### Corrected Program
Based on the problem description and the intended logic, the corrected program should be:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends
    for i in range(n):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        # If no such pair is found, check if sending invitations to any two friends works
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if v[i] == j and v[j] == i:
                    print(2)
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            print(3)
```

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the main condition. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
