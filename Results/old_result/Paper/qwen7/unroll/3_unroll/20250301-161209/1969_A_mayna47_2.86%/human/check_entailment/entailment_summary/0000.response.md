Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
3. The program initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` with all elements set to 0.
4. If `n` is 2, it directly prints 2, which is correct because both friends need to be invited, and they are each other's best friends.
5. For `n > 2`, the program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and are also best friends with each other. This is done by checking if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If this condition is true for any `i`, it means that inviting these two friends will ensure that both come to the party, and thus only 2 invitations are needed.
6. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, which is also correct because in the worst case, we need to invite three friends to ensure at least two come to the party.

Given the logic and the conditions checked, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
