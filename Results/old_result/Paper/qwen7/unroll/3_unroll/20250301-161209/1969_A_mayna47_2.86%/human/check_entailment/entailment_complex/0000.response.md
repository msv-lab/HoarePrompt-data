Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
3. The function `func_1()` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
4. The function initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` with all elements set to 0.
5. If `n` is 2, it directly prints 2 because both friends are each other's best friends and need to be invited individually.
6. For `n > 2`, it checks if there exists a pair of friends `(i, v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it means inviting both friends in the pair would ensure both come to the party, and thus only 2 invitations are needed. In this case, it prints 2 and returns.
7. If no such pair exists, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

However, the logic in the function is flawed. Specifically:
- The initialization of `v` is unnecessary and incorrect. `v` should be initialized as `v = [0] * n` instead of `v = [0] * (n + 1)`.
- The condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is not correctly checking the required condition for the problem. This condition checks if the friend `i` and their best friend `v[i]` are part of a cycle of length 3, which is not relevant to the problem.
- The logic to handle the case when `n` is 2 is correct, but the rest of the logic is incorrect.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
