Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, and if `n` equals 2, then the first element of `v` is set to the input integer and no 2 is printed; otherwise, no changes are made to `v` and no 2 is printed.**
