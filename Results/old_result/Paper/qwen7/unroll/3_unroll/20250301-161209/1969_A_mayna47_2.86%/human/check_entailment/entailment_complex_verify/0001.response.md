### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `p` representing the best friends.

#### Function Definition
- The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

#### Variable Initialization
- The variable `v` is initialized with a length of `n + 1` and set to `[0]`, followed by mapping the input values to this list.
- This step is unnecessary and incorrect. The list `v` should only be of length `n` and should directly map the input values without the initial `[0]`.

#### Special Case Handling
- The special case for `n == 2` is handled correctly, printing `2` as the result.

#### Main Logic
- The logic to check if at least two friends will come to the party is flawed.
  - The condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` checks if the friend `i` and their best friend's best friend's best friend is `i`. This does not necessarily mean that `i` and their best friend will both receive invitations.
  - The logic to print `2` when the condition is met is incorrect. It should check if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and then print `2`.
  - If no such pair is found, the logic incorrectly prints `3` without checking if sending invitations to any two friends would suffice.

#### Output
- The output is printed correctly for each test case.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends
    for i in range(n):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        # If no such pair is found, check if sending invitations to any two friends works
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if v[i] == j and v[j] == i:
                    print(2)
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            print(3)
```

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the main condition. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided logic does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends come to the party.
