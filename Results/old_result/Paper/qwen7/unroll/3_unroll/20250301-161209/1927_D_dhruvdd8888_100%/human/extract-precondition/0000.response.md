Precondition: **t is a positive integer; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a consists of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range [1, 10^6], q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**
