Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Logic**: The function `func_1` initializes `s` and `e` but does not properly handle the logic to identify pairs of different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`. The logic to find such pairs is flawed.
   
2. **Array Construction**: The array `arr` is constructed to store segments where the value changes, but this doesn't directly help in finding different elements within a query range `[l, r]`.

3. **Binary Search Usage**: The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find the segment that starts at or before `l`, but the logic to extract the correct indices from this segment is incorrect.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The code does not correctly handle edge cases where there might be no valid pair of indices within the query range `[l, r]`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

tc = int(input())
for ppp in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    Q = int(input())
    
    # Find all unique elements and their positions
    element_positions = defaultdict(list)
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        element_positions[num].append(i)
    
    for _ in range(Q):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if there are different elements in the range [l, r]
        for num in set(nums[l-1:r]):
            if any(l <= pos <= r for pos in element_positions[num]):
                for pos1 in element_positions[num]:
                    if l <= pos1 <= r:
                        for pos2 in element_positions[num]:
                            if l <= pos2 <= r and pos1 != pos2:
                                print(pos1 + 1, pos2 + 1)
                                break
                        else:
                            continue
                        break
                break
        else:
            print(-1, -1)

```

This corrected version constructs a dictionary to store the positions of each unique element and then checks for different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`. It ensures that the logic is correctly implemented to find and print the required indices.
