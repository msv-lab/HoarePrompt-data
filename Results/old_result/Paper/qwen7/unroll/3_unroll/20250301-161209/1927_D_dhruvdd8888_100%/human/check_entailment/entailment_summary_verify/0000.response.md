### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description and the given example.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on a given array.
- It first identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array and stores these segments along with their starting and ending indices.
- For each query, it determines the segment that overlaps with the query range `[l, r]` and prints specific information based on the values within that segment.
- If no valid segment is found, it prints `-1 -1`.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- We need to find pairs of different elements within each query range `[l, r]`.
- If no such pair exists, we should output `-1 -1`.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's re-examine the provided example to understand the behavior of the program:

**Input:**
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

From the expected and actual outputs, we can see that the program is indeed failing to handle the case where all elements in the queried range are the same. Specifically, for the query `[1, 2]`, the program outputs `2 3` instead of `-1 -1`.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements and stores them in `arr`.
   - For the given array `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, the segments are identified as:
     - `(1, 2, 1)`
     - `(3, 3, 2)`
     - `(4, 5, 1)`

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For the query `[1, 5]`, the program correctly identifies the segment `(1, 2, 1)` and outputs `2 3` because it finds a different element at index 2 and 3.
   - For the query `[1, 2]`, the program identifies the segment `(1, 2, 1)` but incorrectly outputs `2 3` instead of `-1 -1` because it does not check if the entire range `[1, 2]` contains only one unique element.

3. **Handling Single Unique Element:**
   - The program should check if the entire range `[l, r]` contains only one unique element before outputting `2 3`.
   - If the range contains only one unique element, the program should output `-1 -1`.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program fails to correctly handle the case where all elements in the queried range are the same, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where all elements in the queried range are the same, leading to incorrect outputs.
