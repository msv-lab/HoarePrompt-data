Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a consists of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range [1, 10^6], q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and nums is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, the array `a`, `q`, and the list `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
