Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` consists of n integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and `e` is 0; `num` is equal to `nums[0]`; `arr` is a list containing `-1`; `nums` is a list containing `-1`.**

The code `nums.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
