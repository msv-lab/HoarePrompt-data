Reasoning:

1. The given program `func()` does not match the problem description provided with the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. The two functions have different purposes and do not interact with each other.
2. The `func()` function is designed to process an integer `t`, followed by `t` lines of input, where each line contains a binary string `a`. It counts the number of '1's in each string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions.
3. Since the problem description asks to evaluate the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, and the provided `func()` function is unrelated, we cannot determine the correctness of the `func()` function based on the given problem description.

Given that the question asks about the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, which is not evaluated here due to the mismatch with the provided code snippet, we must conclude that the provided code snippet (the `func()` function) is irrelevant to the problem at hand.

Correctness: **False**
