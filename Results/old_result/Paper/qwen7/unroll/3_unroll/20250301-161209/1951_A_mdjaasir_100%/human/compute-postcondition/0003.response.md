Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration of `i` from `0` to `t-1`. For each iteration, the value of `n` and the string `a` are read from input, and the program checks the number of '1's in `a`. If there are no '1's, it prints 'YES'. If there are more than 2 '1's and their count is even, it also prints 'YES'. If there are exactly 2 '1's, it checks if the second '1' is not immediately following the first '1'; if so, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. For all other cases, it prints 'NO'.
