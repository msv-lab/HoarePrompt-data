### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones.
   - Players take turns removing a number `k` of stones from each non-empty pile, where `k` is at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - We need to determine the winner assuming optimal play.

2. **Analyzing the Given Functions:**
   - **func_1(a):**
     - This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and then modifies the list such that each element is the difference between consecutive elements.
     - This transformation seems unrelated to the game logic. The function `func_1` does not contribute to solving the game problem and is not used in `func_2`.
   - **func_2(a, n):**
     - This function uses recursion to determine the winner based on the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`a`).
     - It handles base cases for `n = 1` and `n = 2`.
     - For `n > 2`, it recursively checks the outcome of the next player's move and determines the current player's winning strategy.
     - The function summary states that `func_2` determines whether the first player has a winning strategy based on the initial configuration of stone piles.

3. **Correctness of the Game Logic:**
   - The game logic in `func_2` attempts to solve the problem using the Sprague-Grundy theorem, which is a standard approach for impartial games like this one.
   - However, the implementation of `func_2` is flawed. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the game state and the Sprague-Grundy theorem.
   - The function `func_2` incorrectly assumes that the game state can be reduced to a simple binary decision (1 or 2), which is not accurate for the game described. The game requires a more complex analysis of the Grundy numbers for each pile.

4. **Validation:**
   - The example test cases provided in the problem statement do not necessarily validate the correctness of `func_2` because the function summary suggests that it should use the Sprague-Grundy theorem, but the implementation does not follow this approach.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly compute the Grundy numbers for each pile, and thus it does not accurately determine the winner based on the game rules.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The function `func_2` does not follow the correct approach for solving the game using the Sprague-Grundy theorem.

**Correctness: False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
