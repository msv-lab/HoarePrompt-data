Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify two things:
1. The logic of `func_1` is correct.
2. The logic of `func_2` is correct and aligns with the game rules.

### Function 1 (`func_1`)
- **Input**: A list `a` of non-negative integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
- **Output**: A new sorted list `a_new` containing unique elements. Each element in `a_new` represents the difference between the corresponding element in a temporary sorted and unique list `a_temp` and the previous element in `a_temp`.

#### Analysis:
- The function first sorts and removes duplicates from the list `a` to create `a_new`.
- Then, it iterates through `a_new` and updates each element to be the difference between itself and the previous element in `a_temp`.

This transformation is not directly related to the game logic but seems to be a preprocessing step. However, the problem statement does not specify the purpose of `func_1`, and the annotated description suggests it is not necessary for determining the winner. Therefore, we should focus on the correctness of `func_2`.

### Function 2 (`func_2`)
- **Input**: A list `a` of `n` non-negative integers and an integer `n`.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy, otherwise returns 2.

#### Analysis:
- For `n == 1`, the first player loses because there is only one pile and they cannot make a move.
- For `n == 2`, the first player wins if the first pile has an even number of stones, otherwise the second player (Bob) wins.
- For `n > 2`, the function recursively checks if the second player can force a win. If the first player can force a win, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 2.

#### Game Logic:
- The game involves removing `k` stones from each non-empty pile where `k` is at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.
- The key insight is that the parity (odd/even nature) of the smallest pile is crucial. If the smallest pile is odd, the first player can always make a move that leaves an even smallest pile, forcing the second player into a losing position.

### Verification:
- The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` are correctly handled.
- For `n > 2`, the recursive check ensures that the first player can force a win if the smallest pile is odd and the second player can force a win if the smallest pile is even.

Given the provided example and the logic, the function `func_2` correctly implements the game logic.

### Conclusion:
Since the logic of `func_2` aligns with the game rules and the provided examples, and `func_1` appears to be unnecessary for solving the problem, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
