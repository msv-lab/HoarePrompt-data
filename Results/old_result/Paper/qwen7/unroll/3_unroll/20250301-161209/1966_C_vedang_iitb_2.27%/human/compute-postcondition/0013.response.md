Output State: **The program returns 2**

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list containing a single non-negative integer (length of `a` is 1).
- `winNext` is the result of calling `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` with `n` being 1, and either `winNext` is 0, or (`winNext` is 1 and `a[0]` is 1).

The code snippet provided simply returns the integer `2`. Since no other operations are performed, the return value remains as `2`.
