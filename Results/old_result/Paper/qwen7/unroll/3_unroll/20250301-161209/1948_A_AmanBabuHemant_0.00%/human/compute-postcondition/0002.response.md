Output State: t is the number of test cases initially given, and for each test case, the value of n is read from input. If n is odd, 'NO' is printed. If n is even and less than 400, 'YES' is printed along with a string consisting of '110' repeated n//2 times, but this string length does not exceed 200. If n is even but the resulting string would be longer than 200, 'NO' is printed. The state of t remains unchanged after the loop executes all iterations.
