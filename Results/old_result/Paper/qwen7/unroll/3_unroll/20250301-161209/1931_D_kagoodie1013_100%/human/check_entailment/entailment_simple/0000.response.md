Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem statement. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the test cases, which are stored in the `test_cases` list. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Function Definition**: The `func_1` function iterates over each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs:
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero for each test case.
   - A dictionary `residue_map` is used to keep track of the occurrences of each pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - For each number in the array `arr`, it calculates these residues and uses them to update the `count` by adding the number of times the same pair of residues has been seen before.
   - It also updates the `residue_map` with the current pair of residues.

3. **Output Generation**: After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of counts, where each count corresponds to the number of beautiful pairs found in the respective test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly compute the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. There are no apparent logical errors or issues in the implementation.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
