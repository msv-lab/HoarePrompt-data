### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into individual components.
   - It processes each test case by reading `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates through each test case and initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store the frequency of residues of the form `(r_x, r_y)` where:
     - `r_x = -num % x`
     - `r_y = num % y`
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates the residues and updates the `count` by adding the frequency of the current residue pair from the `residue_map`.
   - It then updates the `residue_map` with the current residue pair.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `r_x = -num % x` ensures that `r_x` is always non-negative and less than `x`.
   - This is crucial because we need to count pairs where both conditions are satisfied, and using `-num % x` ensures that the residue is within the correct range.

4. **Pair Counting:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs by checking the frequency of the current residue pair in the `residue_map`.
   - This approach ensures that all pairs are counted efficiently without needing to explicitly iterate through all possible pairs.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the result for each test case by appending the count to the `results` list and then printing the results.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The use of residues and the dictionary to count pairs ensures that the program handles all constraints and examples provided in the problem description accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
