Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the count of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` for each array `arr` in `test_cases`. For each array, `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`. The count is incremented based on the occurrences of these residue pairs in the array.
