The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It processes each test case by iterating through the list `arr` and calculating the residues of each element with respect to `x` and `y`. It then counts the number of unique pairs of these residues and appends this count to a list `results`. Finally, it returns the list `results`, where each element represents the count of unique residue pairs `(r_x, r_y)` for each corresponding test case.
