You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), x and y (integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and a list of n integers a (such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = num % x, num % y
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the value of `count` calculated for each corresponding test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, `count` is determined by iterating through the list `arr`, calculating the residues of each element with respect to `x` and `y`, and counting the number of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` that have been seen before.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers named `results` where each integer represents the count of unique residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for each corresponding test case in `test_cases`. Each test case involves iterating through the list `arr`, calculating the residues of each element with respect to `x` and `y`, and counting the number of such unique pairs encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5), `x` and `y` (integers between 1 and 10^9), and a list of `n` integers `a` (each between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a list of integers named `results`, where each integer represents the count of unique residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for each corresponding test case in `test_cases`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers named `results` where each integer represents the count of unique residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for each corresponding test case in `test_cases`. Each test case involves iterating through the list `arr`, calculating the residues of each element with respect to `x` and `y`, and counting the number of such unique pairs encountered.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
