### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description and Constraints:**
   - We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in an array \(a\) such that:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case by iterating through the array and using a dictionary (`residue_map`) to count the number of unique pairs of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) for each element in the array.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Reading Input:** The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into individual components. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
   - **Processing Test Cases:**
     - For each test case, it extracts \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(arr\).
     - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
     - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store the frequency of each residue pair \((r_x, r_y)\).
     - For each element in the array, it calculates the residues \(r_x = -num \% x\) and \(r_y = num \% y\).
     - It updates the count by adding the frequency of the current residue pair from the dictionary.
     - It updates the dictionary with the current residue pair.
     - After processing all elements, it appends the count to the results list.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.
   - The use of the dictionary to store and count residue pairs ensures that the program efficiently finds the number of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic for calculating residues and updating the count is correct.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the program follows the described logic without any apparent errors.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description and the provided examples.
