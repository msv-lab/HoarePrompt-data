Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than the square root of `x`. This can lead to missing optimal solutions.

For example, consider the test case:
- Input: `x = 15`, `n = 5`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Program Output: `2`

In this case, the optimal solution would be to split the problem into difficulties `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, which gives a GCD of `3`. However, the program only checks up to the square root of `x` and does not consider the possibility of dividing `x` evenly among more than the square root number of sub-problems.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it considers all possible divisors of `x` that can be used to divide `x` into `n` parts. This can be done by iterating through all possible values from `1` to `x` and checking if they are valid divisors.
