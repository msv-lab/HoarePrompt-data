Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Defining Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.
   
2. **Defining the Function:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not actually used in the main loop.
   - This function is supposed to calculate the maximum balance of the problemset.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Balance:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program calculates the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` (`isqrt(x)`).
   - For each integer `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` with `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` with `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is not called anywhere in the main loop. Instead, the logic is directly placed inside the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called for each test case.

2. **Logic for Calculating Maximum Balance:**
   - The logic to find the maximum balance is correct. It correctly checks all possible divisors of `x` and ensures that the number of sub-problems `n` is feasible.
   - The logic to update `ans` with the maximum balance is also correct.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The result is printed correctly after calculating the maximum balance for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical error due to the unused function `func_1()`. However, the actual logic for calculating the maximum balance is correct. To fix the program, we need to call `func_1()` within the main loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Final Answer:
Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the unused function. However, the core logic for calculating the maximum balance is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
