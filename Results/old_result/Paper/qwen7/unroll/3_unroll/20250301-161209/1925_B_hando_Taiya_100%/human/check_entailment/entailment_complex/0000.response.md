Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) from the input.
2. It iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.
3. In `func_1()`, the program reads the values of `x` and `n` for each test case.
4. The logic inside `func_1()` aims to find the maximum balance, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems. However, the current implementation attempts to find the maximum value between any divisor `i` of `x` and `x // i` where `n` is less than or equal to either `i` or `x // i`. This approach is flawed because it does not actually compute the GCD but rather the largest divisor or quotient under certain conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum GCD of `x` and `n` possible divisors. The correct approach would be to iterate through possible divisors and check if they can divide `x` evenly while ensuring the number of sub-problems `n` is feasible.

However, the provided solution does not implement this correctly. Instead, it tries to maximize the value between `i` and `x // i` without ensuring that these values are GCDs or that they can form `n` sub-problems.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
