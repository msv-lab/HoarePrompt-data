Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) filled with zeros, `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `dp[n - 2][0]` to 0. This changes the value of one specific element in the 2D list `dp`. All other elements remain zero, and the overall structure of `dp` remains a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) filled with zeros, except for the element `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now explicitly set to 0.
