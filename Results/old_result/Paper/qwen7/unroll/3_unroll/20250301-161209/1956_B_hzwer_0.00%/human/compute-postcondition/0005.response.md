Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n-3`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n-3` down to `i = 0` (inclusive), with a step of `-1`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being `n-3`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range specified by the loop condition. Specifically, `i` should be less than or equal to `n-1` (since the loop runs down to `0`).

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop starts with `i` as `n-3`, we need to ensure that `i` is valid according to the loop condition. This means `n-3` should be less than or equal to `n-1`, which is always true. However, we need to ensure that the initial state of `i` is set correctly.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`, which is `n-3`.

**Final State:**
State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) filled with zeros, `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0, `i` is `n-3`**
