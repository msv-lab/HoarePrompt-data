Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and cards is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `cards = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `cards`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
