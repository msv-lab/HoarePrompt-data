Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by optimally selecting cards during the game.
2. The provided program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. It initializes a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points you can get starting from the `i-th` card with `j` cards in hand.
3. The logic inside the nested loops correctly updates the `dp` table based on the count of each card in the input list `cards`.
   - If a card `j + 1` is not present in the remaining cards (`cards.count(j + 1) == 0`), the value remains the same as the next state.
   - If a card `j + 1` is present only once, the player can either skip it or take it, leading to a decision between the current state and the next state plus one point.
   - If a card `j + 1` is present twice, the player has more flexibility, leading to decisions between skipping it, taking it, or taking the next card.
4. The final answer is obtained from `dp[0][0]`, which represents the maximum points starting from the first card with zero cards in hand.
5. The execution summary indicates that the function correctly calculates and returns the maximum number of cards that can be collected, aligning with the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
