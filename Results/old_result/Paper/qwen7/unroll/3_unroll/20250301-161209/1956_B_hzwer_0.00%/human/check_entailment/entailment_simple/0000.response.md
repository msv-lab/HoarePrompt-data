### Reasoning:

The provided solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` is read as the number of cards each player starts with.
   - `cards` is a list of integers representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`)**:
   - `dp[i][j]` is defined as the maximum number of points you can get starting from index `i` with `j` cards in hand.
   - The table is initialized with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` to cover all possible states.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` are set to 0 because if there are no cards left to process, you can't gain any more points.

4. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The outer loop iterates from `n-3` down to `0`, representing the current position in the list of cards.
   - The inner loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`, representing the number of cards in hand.
   - For each state `(i, j)`, the code checks the count of the current card value `j+1` in the `cards` list.
     - If the card value `j+1` is not present in the `cards` list, you can't use it, so `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i+1][j]`.
     - If the card value `j+1` is present once, you have two choices:
       - Not use the card, which gives `dp[i+1][j]`.
       - Use the card, which gives `dp[i+2][j-1] + 1` (since using this card means you lose one card from your hand).
     - If the card value `j+1` is present twice, you have three choices:
       - Not use the card, which gives `dp[i+1][j]`.
       - Use one card, which gives `dp[i+2][j-1] + 1`.
       - Use both cards, which gives `dp[i+1][j+1]`.

5. **Result**:
   - The final result is stored in `dp[0][0]`, which represents the maximum number of points you can get starting from the beginning of the list with no cards in hand.

Given the logic and the structure of the DP table, the solution correctly models the problem and accounts for all possible moves and their outcomes. The provided example test cases also match the expected outputs.
