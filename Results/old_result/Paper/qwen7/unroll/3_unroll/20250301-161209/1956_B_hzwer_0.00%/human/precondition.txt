t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are a sequence of positive integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
