Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed, where each integer is half of the corresponding input integer \(x\) for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, the value of \(y = x // 2\) will be printed. The number of such printed integers will be equal to the number of test cases specified by \(t\).
