You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of `t` lines, where each line contains the value of `x` divided by 2 (integer division), for each test case provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and prints the result of integer division of `x` by 2. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. The program takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `x`.
3. It calculates `y` as `x // 2`, which means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.
4. It prints `y`.

Now let's consider the problem requirements:

- We need to find an integer `y` such that \(1 \leq y < x\) and \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The program suggests \(y = \frac{x}{2}\), but we need to verify if this always gives the maximum value for \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

### Analysis:
- If \(x\) is even, then \(y = \frac{x}{2}\) is an integer and \(\gcd(x, \frac{x}{2}) = \frac{x}{2}\). So, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = x\).
- If \(x\) is odd, then \(y = \frac{x - 1}{2}\) is an integer and \(\gcd(x, \frac{x - 1}{2}) = 1\). So, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + \frac{x - 1}{2} = \frac{x + 1}{2}\).

However, the program simply uses \(y = \frac{x}{2}\) without considering other potential values of \(y\) that might give a higher \(\gcd(x, y)\).

### Counterexample:
Consider \(x = 10\):
- The program outputs \(y = 5\).
- But \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
- However, \(\gcd(10, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\), which is less than 10.
- Also, \(\gcd(10, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is less than 10.

Thus, the program does not necessarily find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure finding the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
