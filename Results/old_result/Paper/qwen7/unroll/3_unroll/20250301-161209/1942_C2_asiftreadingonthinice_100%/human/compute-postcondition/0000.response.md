Output State: **`tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case, as well as the x distinct integers from 1 to n, are yet to be read.**

This means that `tt` now holds the number of test cases, and for each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` along with x distinct integers from 1 to n will be input subsequently.
