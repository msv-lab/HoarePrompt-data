Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle the scenario where the chosen vertices are consecutive. In such cases, the program might not maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 2 2
1 3
```
Here, `n = 4`, `x = 2`, and `y = 2`. The chosen vertices are `1` and `3`. According to the problem description, we can choose up to `y = 2` additional vertices. To maximize the number of triangular pieces, we should choose vertices `2` and `4`.

The correct solution would yield 2 triangular pieces (formed by vertices `1-2-3` and `3-4-1`). However, the provided program does not account for this scenario and would incorrectly calculate the number of triangular pieces.

To fix this, the program needs to handle cases where the chosen vertices are consecutive or nearly consecutive, ensuring that the maximum number of triangular pieces is calculated correctly.
