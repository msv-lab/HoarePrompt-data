Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `f` which iterates over the list `F`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `F`. 

3. **Determine the initial state of `F`**: The initial state of `F` is that it is a sorted list of unique elements returned by `func_4()`.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `F` must contain at least one element. Since `F` is a list, we need to ensure that `F` is not empty.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `F` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`A` is the return value of `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique elements returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a sorted list of unique elements returned by `func_4()` that must have at least one element, `max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the first element involved in the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`**
