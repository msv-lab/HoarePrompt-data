Functionality: **The function processes three lists: `A`, `D`, and `F`. It calculates the maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the second maximum difference (`next_max_diff`) between consecutive elements in `A`. Then, it iterates through each element in `F` and finds the minimum value by evaluating a specific condition involving elements from `D`. Finally, it prints the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.**
