Based on the initial state provided:

- `A` is the return value of `func_4()`.
- `D` is a sorted list of unique elements returned by `func_4()`.
- `F` is the return value of `func_4()`.
- `max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`.
- `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`.
- `index` is the index of the first element involved in the maximum difference.
- `left` is `A[index - 1]`.
- `right` is `A[index]`.
- `ans` is the minimum value obtained by evaluating `min(max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))` for each `f` in `F` and updating it during the loop iterations.

The expression `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the values of `ans` and `next_max_diff`:

- `ans` is derived from the minimum value of a complex expression involving elements of `D` and `F`.
- `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.

Without the exact values of `A`, `D`, and `F`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the result of a specific computation involving elements of `D` and `F`, and `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the maximum of these two values.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff)**
