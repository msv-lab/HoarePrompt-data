You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function processes multiple test cases, each involving four lists (a, d, f) and three integers (t, n, m, k). It calls another function `func_6` for each test case, but does not modify the input lists or integers. The function returns the result of `func_6` after processing all test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - Functions `func_1`, `wrapper`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7` are defined but not used in the main logic. They seem to be placeholders or helper functions that are not utilized in the solution. This is fine as long as they do not interfere with the intended logic.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is encapsulated in `func_7`.
   - `func_7` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It then reads the complexities of the prepared problems (`A`), the models (`D`), and the functions (`F`).
   - It sorts the set of models `D` to ensure it is in ascending order.
   - It calculates the current maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the next maximum difference (`next_max_diff`) in the sequence of prepared problems.
   - It iterates through each function `f` and uses binary search to find the optimal position to insert a new problem to minimize the imbalance.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum achievable imbalance.

3. **Binary Search Usage**:
   - The binary search is correctly used to find the optimal position for the new problem.
   - The logic ensures that the new problem is inserted such that the imbalance is minimized.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the new problem might be inserted at the beginning or end of the sequence.
   - It also handles cases where the new problem does not change the maximum difference significantly.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints. Sorting and binary searches are efficient operations.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the main logic appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. The use of binary search and the handling of edge cases are appropriate.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
