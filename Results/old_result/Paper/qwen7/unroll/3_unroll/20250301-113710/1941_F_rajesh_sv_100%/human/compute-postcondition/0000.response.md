Output State: **`testcases` is the result of `func_3()` call, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}, `d` is a list of m integers where 1 <= d_i <= 10^9, `f` is a list of k integers where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.**

The code `testcases = func_3()` simply calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return value to the variable `testcases`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `d`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial state.
