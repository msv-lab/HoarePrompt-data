The code assigns the value of `max_diff` to `ans`. This means that `ans` now holds the value of `max_diff`, which was the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is the return value of `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique elements returned by `func_4()`, `F` is the return value of `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the first element involved in the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.**
