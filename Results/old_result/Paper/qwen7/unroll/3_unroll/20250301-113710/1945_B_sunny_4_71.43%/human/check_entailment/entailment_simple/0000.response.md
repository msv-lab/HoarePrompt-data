Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. **Calculation of A and B**:
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`. This represents the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of `m + 1` minutes.
   - `B` is calculated similarly as `int(m / b) + 1`. This represents the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the same period.
4. **Output**: The program prints the sum `A + B` for each test case, which should represent the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

However, there is a logical flaw in the calculation of `A` and `B`. The formula used does not account for the possibility that some fireworks might overlap in their visibility periods. Specifically, the ceiling division (`int(m / a) + 1`) and similar for `b` do not ensure that overlapping fireworks are counted correctly.

To find the correct solution, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the combined launches. The correct approach involves calculating the number of intervals of `m` that fit into the LCM of `a` and `b`.

Given the flawed logic in the current implementation, the provided solution will not always yield the correct result. Therefore, the program as written is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
