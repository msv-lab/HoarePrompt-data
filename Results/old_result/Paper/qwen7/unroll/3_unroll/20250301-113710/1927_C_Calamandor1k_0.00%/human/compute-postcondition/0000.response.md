Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and the value of `t` is updated to the input integer. All other variables (n, m, k, a, b) are not affected by this line of code.
