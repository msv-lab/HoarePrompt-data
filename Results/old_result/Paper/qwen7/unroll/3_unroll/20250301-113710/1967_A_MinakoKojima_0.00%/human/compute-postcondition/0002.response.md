Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}; after executing all iterations of the loop, ans is an integer representing the product of differences between consecutive elements in the modified list a, where the list a is adjusted based on the value of k and the minimum element m in the initial list a.
