Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It correctly reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program constructs an initial permutation `array` using `list(range(1, n + 1))`. This creates a list `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The variable `answer` starts with `[1]`, and `a` is initialized as `[1, -1]`.

3. **Building the K-Level Permutation**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` to fill the `answer` list.
   - The logic inside the loop alternates between selecting elements from the start (`a[0]`) and end (`a[-1]`) of the `array`:
     - If `(-1) ** i == -1`, it appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - Otherwise, it appends `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed `answer` list is printed.

### Verification of K-Level Property

To verify if the constructed permutation is k-level, we need to check the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` and ensure that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is at most 1.

#### Example Verification

Let's manually verify the construction for one of the examples provided:

- **Test Case**: `n = 10`, `k = 4`
- **Initial Array**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
- **Answer Construction**:
  - `a = [1, -1]`
  - Iterations:
    - `i = 1`: `(-1) ** 1 == -1` → `answer = [1, 10]`, `a = [1, -2]`
    - `i = 2`: `(-1) ** 2 == 1` → `answer = [1, 10, 6]`, `a = [3, -2]`
    - `i = 3`: `(-1) ** 3 == -1` → `answer = [1, 10, 6, 7]`, `a = [3, -1]`
    - `i = 4`: `(-1) ** 4 == 1` → `answer = [1, 10, 6, 7, 5]`, `a = [5, -1]`
    - `i = 5`: `(-1) ** 5 == -1` → `answer = [1, 10, 6, 7, 5, 9]`, `a = [5, -2]`
    - `i = 6`: `(-1) ** 6 == 1` → `answer = [1, 10, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8]`, `a = [7, -2]`
    - `i = 7`: `(-1) ** 7 == -1` → `answer = [1, 10, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 3]`, `a = [7, -1]`
    - `i = 8`: `(-1) ** 8 == 1` → `answer = [1, 10, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 3, 4]`, `a = [9, -1]`
    - `i = 9`: `(-1) ** 9 == -1` → `answer = [1, 10, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2]`

- **Sums of Segments**:
  - Segment 1: `1 + 10 + 6 + 7 = 24`
  - Segment 2: `10 + 6 + 7 + 5 = 28`
  - Segment 3: `6 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 27`
  - Segment 4: `7 + 5 + 9 + 8 = 29`
  - Segment 5: `5 + 9 + 8 + 3 = 25`
  - Segment 6: `9 + 8 + 3 + 4 = 24`
  - Segment 7: `8 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 17`

- **Max Sum - Min Sum**: `29 - 17 = 12` (This is incorrect, so let's recheck the logic)

Upon rechecking, the logic seems flawed because it doesn't ensure the k-level property. The approach of alternating between start and end indices does not guarantee that the sums of all segments will be within 1 unit of each other.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
