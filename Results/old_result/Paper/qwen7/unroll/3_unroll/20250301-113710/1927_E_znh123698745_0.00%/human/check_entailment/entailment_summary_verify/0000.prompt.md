You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
For each test case, the function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), constructs an array from 1 to \( n \), and then generates a sequence starting with 1, followed by alternating elements from the beginning and end of the array, until the entire array is traversed. This sequence is printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a k-level permutation for all possible inputs. Specifically, the program generates a permutation by alternating between two indices, which does not guarantee that the sums of continuous segments of length k will differ by no more than 1.

For example, consider the case where \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \):

- The generated permutation using the given logic might look like this: `[1, 6, 3, 7, 2, 5, 4, 10, 8, 9]`.

Let's calculate the sums of continuous segments of length 4:
- \( s_1 = 1 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 17 \)
- \( s_2 = 6 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 18 \)
- \( s_3 = 3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17 \)
- \( s_4 = 7 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 18 \)
- \( s_5 = 2 + 5 + 4 + 10 = 21 \)
- \( s_6 = 5 + 4 + 10 + 8 = 27 \)
- \( s_7 = 4 + 10 + 8 + 9 = 31 \)

Here, the maximum sum is 31 and the minimum sum is 17, so the difference is \( 31 - 17 = 14 \), which is greater than 1. Therefore, the permutation is not k-level.

Hence, the program does not meet the requirement for generating a k-level permutation for all inputs, making it incorrect.
