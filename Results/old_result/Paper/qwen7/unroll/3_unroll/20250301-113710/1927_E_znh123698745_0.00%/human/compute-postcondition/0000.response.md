Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means that the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable in the loop) and the result of `int(input())` are the key elements here.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop condition directly. It's used to iterate over the range produced by `int(input())`.
   - The variable `int(input())` is crucial because it determines how many times the loop will run. The input must be a valid integer that satisfies the condition given in the problem statement.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The input must be an integer.
   - The integer must be within the range specified by the problem statement, i.e., `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` meets the criteria. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input will be a valid integer within the specified range.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

Since `t` is the input that will determine the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`**
