Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) (number of buns sold at the modified price). The profit calculation should consider both the modified price for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: The provided code uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \). However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly calculating the profit.
   - The binary search logic does not seem to be appropriate for this problem since the profit function is not strictly increasing or decreasing with respect to \( k \).
   - The condition in `func_1` is incorrect and does not help in finding the maximum profit.

3. **Correct Approach**: Instead of using binary search, we can directly calculate the profit for different values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n \) and find the maximum profit.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Calculate the profit for \( k = 0 \) to \( k = n \).
   - Return the maximum profit found.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = 0
            if k > 0:
                profit += sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1))
            profit += (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect because it uses an inappropriate method (binary search) and has a flawed profit calculation function.

Correctness: **False**
