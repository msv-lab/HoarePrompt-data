Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input using `input().split()`, and then converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then collected into a list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
