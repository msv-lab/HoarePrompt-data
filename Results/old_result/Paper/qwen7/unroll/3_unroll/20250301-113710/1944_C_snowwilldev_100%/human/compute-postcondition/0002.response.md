Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, N is an input integer, a is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` and no elements added yet.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `cnt` can hold integer values for keys that are not explicitly set, starting with a default value of 0. However, no elements are added to `cnt` in the given code snippet, so it remains empty. All other variables (`t`, `N`, and `a`) retain their initial states.
