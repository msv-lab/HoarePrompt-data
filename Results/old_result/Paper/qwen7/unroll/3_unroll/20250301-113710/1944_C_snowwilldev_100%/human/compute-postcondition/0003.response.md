Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `N` is given as an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < N`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `N` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `N` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `t`: This variable is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). However, this variable is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `a`: This is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. This list is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `cnt`: This is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `int` and no elements added yet. This dictionary is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `N` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `N` must be greater than 0**
