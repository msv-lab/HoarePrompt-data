#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, N is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict where the keys are integers from the list `a` and the values are their respective counts after iterating through the list `a` for `N` times.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict where the keys are integers from the list `a` and the values are their respective counts after iterating through the list `a` for `N` times, the loop has executed all iterations without returning any value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer N, followed by a list of N integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list. After counting, it iterates through the possible integers, checking if the count of any integer is exactly 1 or if the count of any integer becomes zero. If either condition is met, it returns that integer. If no such integer is found after processing all possible integers, it implicitly returns -1 (though this is not explicitly stated in the code).
