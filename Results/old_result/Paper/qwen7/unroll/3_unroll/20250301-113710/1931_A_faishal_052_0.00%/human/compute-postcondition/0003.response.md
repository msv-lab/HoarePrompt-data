Output State: The output state will consist of three lowercase letters printed for each iteration of the outer loop, based on the value of `lex` after processing. Specifically, the first two characters will always be 'a' (1 in the array) and 'z' (26 in the array), and the third character will be the result of `lex % 26` converted to a lowercase letter, plus 'a'. This process is repeated for each case provided by the user.
