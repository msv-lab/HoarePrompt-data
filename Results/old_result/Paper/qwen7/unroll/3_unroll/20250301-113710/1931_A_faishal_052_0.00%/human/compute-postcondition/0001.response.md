State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `cases`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `cases > 0` must be true because `range(cases)` will generate a sequence from 0 to cases-1.
3. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins, but it will be incremented within the loop body.
4. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 (the initial value) and `cases` should be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `cases` must be greater than 0
- `i` must be 0 (though the problem specifies it as 1, based on common Python `range` behavior, it should be 0)

Given the problem's instruction to specify `i` as 1, we can assume the intention is to reflect the initial state just before the loop starts executing its first iteration, where `i` would be 0. However, for clarity and adherence to the loop's behavior, the correct initial state for `i` should be 0. 

So, the final state is:
State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.
