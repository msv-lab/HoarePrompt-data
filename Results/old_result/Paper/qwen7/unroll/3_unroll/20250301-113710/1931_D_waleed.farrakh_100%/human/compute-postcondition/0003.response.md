Output State: **`data` is a list containing the lines from `input().splitlines()`, `t` is the first line of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `test_cases` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `test_cases`. This does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
