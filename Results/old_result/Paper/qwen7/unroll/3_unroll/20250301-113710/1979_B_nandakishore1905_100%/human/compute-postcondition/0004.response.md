Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two distinct non-negative integers \( n \) and \( m \). It calculates the absolute difference \( k \) between \( n \) and \( m \). Based on the value of \( k \), it prints one of three possible outputs for each test case:
- If \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \).
- If \( k \) is odd, it prints 1.
- If \( k \) is even and not a power of 2, it repeatedly subtracts the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) until \( k \) becomes a power of 2 or 1, then prints the final value of \( k \).

The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results for each test case.**
