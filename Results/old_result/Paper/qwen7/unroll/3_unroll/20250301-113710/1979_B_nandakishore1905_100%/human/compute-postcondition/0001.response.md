Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as the result of the conditions evaluated within the loop for each test case. For each test case, the value of `k` (which is `abs(n - m)`) is checked against specific conditions, and based on those conditions, either `k`, `1`, or a calculated value derived from the binary representation of `k` is printed. The exact sequence of integers will depend on the input values for each test case.
