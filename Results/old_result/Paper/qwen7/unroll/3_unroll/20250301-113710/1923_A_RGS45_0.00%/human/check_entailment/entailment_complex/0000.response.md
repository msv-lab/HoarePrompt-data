Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Identification of the Substring**: The code uses `x = arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first '1' and `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last '1' in the reversed string. However, `arr[::-1].find('1')` returns the index of the last '1' from the end of the string, which is not correct for finding the index of the last '1' from the start of the string. Instead, it should be `y = arr.rfind('1')`.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Zeros**: The code then creates a substring `z = arr[x:n - y]` using these indices, but this approach is flawed because `n - y` might not be the correct end index. The correct end index should be `n - y + 1` to include the last '1' in the substring.

3. **Logic Error**: The logic for counting zeros in the substring is also incorrect. The code simply counts the zeros in the substring `z`, but it should count the zeros between the first and last '1' inclusive.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
