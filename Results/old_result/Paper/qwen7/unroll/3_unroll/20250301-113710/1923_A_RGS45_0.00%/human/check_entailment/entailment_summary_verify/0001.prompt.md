You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (the length of the binary string), and a binary string representing the state of \( n \) cells. It then finds the substring between the first and last occurrence of '1' (inclusive) and counts the number of '0's in this substring. The function outputs the count of '0's for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of cells.
   - It then reads a string `arr` which contains `n` characters, where '0' indicates a free cell and '1' indicates a cell with a chip.

2. **Finding Positions of Chips:**
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip.
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip from the right.
   - This gives us the positions of the first and last chips in the array.

3. **Extracting Relevant Part of Array:**
   - The program extracts a substring `z` from `arr` starting from the position of the first chip to the position just before the last chip from the right.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the extracted substring `z`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of free cells.

### Analysis:

- **Objective:** The objective is to move chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required would be equal to the number of free cells between the first and last chip.
- **Current Approach:** The current approach counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which is not necessarily the minimum number of operations required. It only considers the free cells between the first and last chip and does not account for moving chips to the leftmost possible positions.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - First chip at index 1, last chip at index 5.
  - Extracted substring: `1 1 0 1 1`
  - Count of free cells: 1 (Correct)
- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - First chip at index 1, last chip at index 1.
  - Extracted substring: `1`
  - Count of free cells: 0 (Correct)
- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - No free cells, no operations needed.
  - Count of free cells: 0 (Correct)
- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - First chip at index 0, last chip at index 4.
  - Extracted substring: `0 1 0 1`
  - Count of free cells: 2 (Incorrect, should be 2 operations to move both chips to the left)

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips to form a single block. It only counts the free cells between the first and last chip, which is not always the optimal solution.

### Correctness:

**False**
