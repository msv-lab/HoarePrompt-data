### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function constructs an array `arr` that records the start and end indices of segments where the elements change.
   - It then processes each query to find a pair of indices `(s, e+1)` or `(-1, -1)` based on whether the subarray from `l` to `r-1` meets specific criteria.
   - The function should handle cases where all elements in the queried subarray are the same.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments of the array where the elements change.
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts before or at `l`.
   - It then checks if the segment ends within the query range `r`.

3. **Handling Identical Elements:**
   - The program checks if the start index `s` is greater than `l`, indicating a change in the element.
   - If `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if the end index `e` is within the query range.
   - If `e` is less than `r`, it prints the pair `(s, e+1)`.
   - If `e` is outside the query range or `s` is greater than `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the queried subarray consists of identical elements.
   - When `s` is greater than `l` and `e` is outside the query range, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
   - When `s` is greater than `r`, it also prints `(-1, -1)`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same. It ensures that if there is no valid pair of different elements within the queried subarray, it outputs `(-1, -1)`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the program correctly handles the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same, as demonstrated by the edge case handling in the code.
