You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` remains a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `q` remains an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of tuples, `N` remains an integer input from stdin, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `e` is 0, `num` is the last element of `nums`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The output state will consist of a series of pairs of integers (-1, -1) or (s, e+1), depending on the conditions inside the loop. Each pair represents the result of processing one input line given by the user, where each line provides two integers l and r. The actual values of s and e will vary based on the contents of the arr list and the positions determined by bisect_left function.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined set of variables: an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a list `a` of `n` integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and an integer `q` such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The function returns nothing directly but processes these inputs to handle `q` queries, each defined by `l` and `r`, to perform some operation (unspecified in the given information) on the sublist of `a` from index `l` to `r-1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
