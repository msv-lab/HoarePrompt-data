### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of different elements within a specified subarray for multiple queries. If no such pair exists, the output should be `-1 -1`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`N`), the array itself, and the number of queries (`q`).
   - It then processes the array to identify segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that covers the query range and then determines if the segment boundaries cover the query range.
   - The code handles cases where no different elements are found within the query range.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - **Segment Identification**: The code correctly identifies segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - **Query Processing**: The code uses binary search to find the relevant segment and checks if the segment boundaries cover the query range.
   - **Output Handling**: The code handles cases where no different elements are found within the query range.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Segments**: The code correctly handles segments with only one element.
   - **No Different Elements**: The code correctly outputs `-1 -1` when no different elements are found.
   - **Boundary Conditions**: The code correctly handles boundary conditions for the query ranges.

5. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The approach of identifying segments and using binary search to find relevant segments is sound.
   - The handling of edge cases and boundary conditions appears to be correct.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for determining the output. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the case where the identified segment boundaries do not cover the entire query range but still have different elements.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Segment Identification**: The code correctly identifies segments where consecutive elements are the same.
- **Query Processing**: The code uses binary search to find the segment that covers the query range. However, the logic for determining the output is flawed. The code checks if `s > l` and `e >= r` to decide the output, but this does not guarantee that there are different elements within the segment.

### Example Counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

- The array is `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`.
- The segments are identified as `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 4, 1)]`.
- For the query `1 5`, the code correctly identifies the segment `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 4, 1)]` and returns `2 3` because `2` and `3` are different.
- For the query `1 2`, the code incorrectly returns `-1 -1` because `s > l` and `e >= r` are not checked properly.
- For the query `1 3`, the code correctly returns `-1 -1` because the segment `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 4, 1)]` does not fully cover the range `1 3`.

### Corrected Logic:

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the segment boundaries cover the entire query range and check if there are different elements within the segment.

### Corrected Code:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

tc = int(input())
for ppp in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        num = nums[i]
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        (s, e, _) = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            # Check if there are different elements within the segment
            for i in range(s, e + 1):
                if nums[i] != nums[s]:
                    print(s, i)
                    break
            else:
                print(-1, -1)
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the code does not correctly handle the case where the segment boundaries do not cover the entire query range but still have different elements.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
