You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #State: The output state will consist of a series of pairs of integers (-1, -1) or (s, e+1), depending on the conditions inside the loop. Each pair represents the result of processing one input line given by the user, where each line provides two integers l and r. The actual values of s and e will vary based on the contents of the arr list and the positions determined by bisect_left function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a predefined set of variables: an integer `t` within the range 1 to 10^4, an integer `n` within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, a list `a` of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and an integer `q` within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The function constructs an array `arr` that records changes in the elements of `nums`. It then handles `q` queries, each defined by `l` and `r`, to determine the start (`s`) and end (`e`) indices of a subarray within `a` that meets certain conditions. For each query, it outputs either a pair of indices `(s, e+1)` or `(-1, -1)` based on whether the subarray from `l` to `r-1` meets specific criteria.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same. Specifically, in the `func_1` function, when the queried subarray consists of identical elements, the program fails to find a pair of different elements, leading to incorrect output. For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

The expected output would be `-1 -1`, but the program will incorrectly output a valid pair of indices since it does not properly handle the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same.
