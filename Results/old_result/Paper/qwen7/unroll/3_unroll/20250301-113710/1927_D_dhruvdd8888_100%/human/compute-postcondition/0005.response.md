Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `N` is an integer input from stdin, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `e` is 0, `num` is the first element of `nums`.**

In this output state, the variable `num` is updated to be the first element of the list `nums`. All other variables retain their initial states.
