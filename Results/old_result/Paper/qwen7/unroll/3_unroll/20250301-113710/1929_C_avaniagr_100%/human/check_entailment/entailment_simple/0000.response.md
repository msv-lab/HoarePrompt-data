### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `k`, `x`, and `a` from each test case using `map(int, s.split())`.

2. **Conditions Check**:
   - **Case 1**: If `x < k - 1`, the logic checks if `a >= x + 1`. This condition ensures that Sasha can afford to lose up to `x` times in a row and still have enough coins to start a new sequence of bets after each loss. If this condition is met, Sasha can guarantee to have any number of coins by placing the minimum possible bet (`1`) after each loss.
   - **Case 2**: If `x == k - 1`, the logic checks if `a >= x + 2`. This condition ensures that Sasha can afford to lose `x` times in a row and still have enough coins left to place the next bet after each loss. If this condition is met, Sasha can guarantee to have any number of coins by placing the minimum possible bet (`1`) after each loss.
   - **Case 3**: If `x > k - 1`, the logic calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can continue betting without running out of coins even after `x` consecutive losses. The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to iteratively calculate the required number of coins. If `a >= z`, Sasha can guarantee to have any number of coins.

3. **Output**: The program prints `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked. The output format matches the problem statement requirements.

4. **Loop Execution**: The program loops through each test case correctly and prints the result for each one.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem description and the conditions provided.

### Correctness:
**True**
