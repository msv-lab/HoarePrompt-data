Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where `x` (maximum number of consecutive losses) is greater than or equal to `k-1` (number of times the bet is increased in case of a win). 

For example, consider the test case `(k, x, a) = (4, 4, 5)`. According to the problem description, Sasha can lose up to 4 times in a row. However, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' for this case because it does not properly account for the possibility of increasing the bet after a series of losses. 

To illustrate, let's walk through the logic for `k=4`, `x=4`, and `a=5`:
- Sasha starts with 5 coins.
- If Sasha loses 4 times in a row, he will have 0 coins.
- Even if he wins after those 4 losses, he would need to place a bet of 5 coins, which is impossible since he has 0 coins.

The program does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
