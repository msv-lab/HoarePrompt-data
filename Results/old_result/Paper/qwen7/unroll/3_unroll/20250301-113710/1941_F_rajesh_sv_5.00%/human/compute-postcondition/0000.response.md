Output State: **`testcases' is the return value of func_3()`**.

Explanation: The code `testcases = func_3()` assigns the return value of the function `func_3()` to the variable `testcases`. Since the exact return value of `func_3()` is not specified, we represent it as the return value of `func_3()`. All other variables remain in their initial state as per the precondition.
