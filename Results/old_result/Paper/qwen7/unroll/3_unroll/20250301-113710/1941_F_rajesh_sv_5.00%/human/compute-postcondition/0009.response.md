Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in the list `A` starting from index 1 to `n-1`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements under the same condition, `index` remains the index of the element where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, and the states of `D`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `F` remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `max_diff`, while all other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
