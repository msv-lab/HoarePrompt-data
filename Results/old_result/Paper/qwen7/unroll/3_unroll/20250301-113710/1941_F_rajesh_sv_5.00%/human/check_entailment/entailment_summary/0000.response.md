Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum imbalance after potentially adding one new problem to the existing set of problems.
2. The provided functions seem to handle different parts of the solution:
   - `func_2` reads a line from standard input.
   - `func_3` converts the input from `func_2` to an integer.
   - `func_4` splits a string from `func_2` using a specified delimiter and maps the substrings to integers.
   - `func_5` calls `func_2` and seems to be used for reading input.
   - `func_6` calculates the initial imbalance and attempts to minimize it by considering the addition of new problems.
   - `func_7` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each.
3. `func_6` correctly:
   - Reads the necessary inputs.
   - Sorts and processes the complexities of the models and functions.
   - Uses binary search to find the optimal position to add a new problem.
   - Calculates the minimum possible imbalance.
4. The logic in `func_6` appears to be correct for solving the problem as described.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions collectively meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
