Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in the list `A` starting from index 1 to `n-1`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements under the same condition, `index` remains the index of the element where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, and the states of `D`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `F` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns `A[index - 1]` to `left` and `A[index]` to `right`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The values of `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` also remain unchanged as they are not involved in the assignment operations.
