The function calculates and prints the maximum value among the largest difference (`max_diff`) between consecutive elements in the list `A` and the minimum value of `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)` for each `f` in `F` where `l` is determined using binary search. The function does not return any value but prints the result.
