t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The list a contains n strictly increasing integers, each in the range [1, 2 \cdot 10^9]. The lists d and f contain m and k positive integers, respectively, each in the range [1, 10^9].
