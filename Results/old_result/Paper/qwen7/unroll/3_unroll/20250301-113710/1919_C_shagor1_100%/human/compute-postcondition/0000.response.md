Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `pass` does nothing and simply continues to the next line without changing any variable values or performing any operations. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
