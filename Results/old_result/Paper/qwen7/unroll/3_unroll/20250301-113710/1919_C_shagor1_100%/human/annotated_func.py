#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a single test case containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`. It does not return any value but handles the test case internally, ensuring that each `a_i` is within the range 1 to `n`.
