Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program attempts to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences `s` and `t`, but it does not follow the optimal strategy required to achieve the minimum possible penalty.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program tries to minimize the penalty by tracking two variables (`la` and `lb`) and incrementing `ans` when an element is greater than both `la` and `lb`. This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array into two subsequences to minimize the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly handle the splitting of the array into subsequences `s` and `t`. It only keeps track of the smallest and second smallest values seen so far, which does not ensure the minimum penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly involving dynamic programming or a different approach to optimally split the array. The provided solution does not achieve this.

### Correct Approach:
A correct solution would involve sorting the array and then finding the optimal split point to minimize the penalty. However, the provided code does not implement this logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
