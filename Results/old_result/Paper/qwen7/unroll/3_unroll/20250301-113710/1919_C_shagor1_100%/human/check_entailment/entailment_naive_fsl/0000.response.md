Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the penalty is flawed. The program attempts to find the minimum penalty by maintaining two variables `la` and `lb`, but it does not properly account for the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences `s` and `t`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This happens because the program does not correctly count the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences. The program tries to minimize the penalty by merging elements, but it fails to accurately compute the penalty for the optimal split.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and counting the number of inversions, which can help in determining the minimum penalty. The provided solution does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
