The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set consists of an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each set, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`, then calculates the sum of these counts divided by 4, and finally prints this sum for each test case.
