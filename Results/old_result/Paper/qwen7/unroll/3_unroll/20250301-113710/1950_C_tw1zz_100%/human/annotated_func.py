#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM", where "h1" is the hour converted to 12-hour format, "m" is the minute, and "AM/PM" indicates whether it is morning or afternoon. The specific times printed depend on the inputs provided during the loop executions. Each line represents the transformed time from the input "hh:mm" into 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of times provided as input, converting them from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It prints each converted time on a new line. The function does not return any value but outputs the transformed times.
