Reasoning:

1. The program is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. It correctly handles the conversion of hours from 00 to 12 and sets the appropriate AM/PM indicator.
3. However, there are several issues with the implementation:
   - The code uses multiple `if` statements to handle each possible hour, which is inefficient and can be simplified.
   - The code does not account for the case where the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format, which should be "12:00 PM".
   - The code does not handle the case where the hour is 00 in the 24-hour format, which should be "12:00 AM".

Let's analyze the specific issues:

- For hours 01 to 09, the code correctly converts them to 12-hour format but incorrectly appends "AM" without considering that these could also be "PM" in certain contexts.
- For hours 10 to 12, the code correctly converts them to 12-hour format and appends "PM", but it fails to handle the special case of "12:00 PM".
- For hours 13 to 23, the code correctly converts them to 12-hour format and appends "PM", but it fails to handle the special case of "12:00 PM" when the hour is 24 (which should be "12:00 AM").
- For hour 00, the code incorrectly converts it to "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM".

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and will produce incorrect results for some inputs.

Correctness: **False**
