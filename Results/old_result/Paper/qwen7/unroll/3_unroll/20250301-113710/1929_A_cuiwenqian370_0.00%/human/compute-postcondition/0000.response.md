Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial conditions of `n` being an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and each element in `arr` being an integer in the range \(1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9\) remain unchanged. After sorting, the list `arr` contains the same elements but in a sorted order.
