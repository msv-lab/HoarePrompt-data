Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `left` and `right`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `new_arr` is an empty list.
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is n - 1.

4. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `left <= right` must be true.
   - Currently, `left` is 0 and `right` is n - 1.
   - Since `0 <= n - 1` is always true for any valid non-negative integer `n`, no adjustment is necessary for these variables.

Given that the current values of `left` and `right` satisfy the loop condition, no adjustments are needed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is n - 1**
