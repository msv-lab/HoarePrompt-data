Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. After executing the loop, the output consists of either "2" printed for each iteration where `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, or "3" printed for each iteration where this condition does not hold.
