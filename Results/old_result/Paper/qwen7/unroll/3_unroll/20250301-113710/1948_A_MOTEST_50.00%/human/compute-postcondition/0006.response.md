Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. It returns a value based on the relationship between `t` and `n`.**

Given the constraints and the implied processing, the function likely evaluates `t` and `n` and returns a result based on their comparison or some other operation involving these two integers. However, without the exact logic, the core functionality described here focuses on the parameters and the expected range they belong to.
