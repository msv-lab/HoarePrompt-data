Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `os.system('cls')` has been called, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `string.ascii_uppercase` to the variable `s`. This string contains all uppercase letters from A to Z. The values of `t` and the call to `os.system('cls')` remain unchanged.
