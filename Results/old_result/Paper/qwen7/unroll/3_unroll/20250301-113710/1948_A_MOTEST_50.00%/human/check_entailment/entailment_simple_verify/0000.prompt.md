You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The screen is cleared, then for each iteration of the loop, depending on the value of `n`, either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. If `n` is even, `ans` consists of pairs of characters from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' up to half the value of `n`. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of characters from 'C' to 'Z' up to `n-3`. After all iterations, the final state of the screen displays the results of each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd and greater than 1 correctly. According to the problem description, for an odd `n`, the string should have exactly `n` special characters. However, the current implementation does not ensure this condition is met. Specifically, when `n` is odd and greater than 1, the program generates a string with fewer than `n` special characters.

For example, consider `n = 3`. The program will generate the string 'AAA', which has only 2 special characters (positions 1 and 3), instead of 3. This violates the requirement that there must be exactly `n` special characters in the string.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters. One way to achieve this is by generating a string with a pattern that guarantees the required number of special characters. For instance, a pattern like 'AABBA' can be used for `n = 4`, and 'AABBCC' for `n = 6`, and so on.
