Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and the constraints specified in the problem.
2. For even values of `n`, the program generates a string consisting of pairs of different uppercase letters. This ensures that every character except the first and last will have exactly one neighbor that is different, making them special characters. The first and last characters will not be special unless `n` is 2, but since the problem specifies that `n` is at least 1, this edge case is handled by checking if `n` is 1 separately.
3. For odd values of `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' and then adds pairs of different uppercase letters. This also ensures that all characters except possibly the first and last will be special. The first and last characters will not be special unless `n` is 3, but again, this edge case is handled by checking if `n` is 1 separately.
4. The program correctly identifies when `n` is 1 and prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
5. The program ensures that the generated string is of length at most 200, which satisfies the problem constraints.
6. The program clears the screen after processing all test cases, which is not strictly necessary but does not affect the correctness of the output.

Given these points, the program appears to meet all the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
