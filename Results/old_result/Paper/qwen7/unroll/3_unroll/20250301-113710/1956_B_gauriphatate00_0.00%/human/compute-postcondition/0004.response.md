Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings starting from the second element, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, and `a` is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand.**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 1, so after executing the code, `idx` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `data`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
