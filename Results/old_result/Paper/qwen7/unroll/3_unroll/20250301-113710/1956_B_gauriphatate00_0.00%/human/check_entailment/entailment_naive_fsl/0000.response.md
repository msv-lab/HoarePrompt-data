Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game dynamics as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` only considers the number of pairs of cards in the player's hand and returns the minimum of half the number of cards and the number of pairs. However, this approach does not account for Nene's optimal strategy of minimizing the player's score.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4
  1 1 2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  1
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```

In this scenario, the player has two cards with the number 1. According to the rules, Nene will always try to maximize her score while minimizing the player's score. Hereâ€™s how the game would proceed if played optimally:

1. The player selects one of the cards with the number 1.
2. Nene will then select the other card with the number 1, scoring 1 point and placing it on the table.
3. The player now has no more cards to play, and Nene continues her turns.

Thus, the player can only score 1 point at most, not 2. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the player can always score the maximum possible points without considering Nene's optimal strategy.
