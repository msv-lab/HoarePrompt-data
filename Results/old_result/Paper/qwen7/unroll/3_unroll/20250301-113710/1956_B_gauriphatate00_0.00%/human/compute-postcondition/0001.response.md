Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, and `a` is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand.**

Explanation: The line `data = input().split()` reads a single line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
