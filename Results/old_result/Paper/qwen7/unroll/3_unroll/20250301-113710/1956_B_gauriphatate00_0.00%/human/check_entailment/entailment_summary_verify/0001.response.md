### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of points you can get in the game.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
   - You want to maximize your score under this condition.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum of two values:
     1. The number of pairs of cards in your hand (where a pair means two cards with the same number).
     2. Half of the total number of cards you have (`n // 2`).
   - The logic here is flawed. While it is true that Nene can block all but one pair, the function does not account for the fact that Nene will strategically place cards to minimize your points. Specifically, if you have more than `n // 2` pairs, Nene can still block all but one pair, but you might not necessarily get a point for each unblocked pair. The function only returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for maximizing your points.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and outputs the results.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the optimal strategy for Nene. For example, consider the following scenario:
     - You have the cards `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
     - Nene has the cards `[3, 3, 4, 4]`.
     - According to `func_1`, the number of pairs is 2, and `n // 2` is 2, so it returns 2. However, Nene can block both pairs, giving you 0 points.
     - In another scenario, you have the cards `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - Nene has the cards `[2, 2, 3, 3]`.
     - According to `func_1`, the number of pairs is 2, and `n // 2` is 2, so it returns 2. However, Nene can block one pair, giving you 1 point.
   - The function should instead simulate the optimal strategy for Nene, which involves blocking your points whenever possible.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
