Output State: **idx is 2 + 2 * t, t is unchanged, data is unchanged, n is an integer obtained from int(data[0]), a is a list of integers obtained from data starting from idx + t to idx + 2 * t, results is a list of outputs from func_1(n, a) for each iteration, no change in the value of results as the loop only prints the values but does not modify them.**
