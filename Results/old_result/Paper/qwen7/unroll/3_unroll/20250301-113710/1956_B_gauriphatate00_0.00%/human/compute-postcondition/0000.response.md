Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `a` is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list a at most 2 times; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`, nor does it affect any other variables. It just changes how the `input` function is accessed in the program.
