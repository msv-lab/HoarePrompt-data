Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of card values `a`. It then calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine some outcome for each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each case. The final state includes the unchanged `idx`, `t`, and `data`, and `results` containing the outcomes from `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.**
