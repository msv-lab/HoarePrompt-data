### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step-by-step to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The game involves two players, you and Nene, who each receive \( n \) cards from a deck of \( 2n \) cards.
- Each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice in the deck.
- Players take turns selecting one of their cards, scoring 1 point if the card matches a card already on the table.
- Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in the player's hand.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of cards (`pairs`) and returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.
   - This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for Nene's optimal strategy.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading the input and processing multiple test cases but relies on `func_1` for the actual computation.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_2` reads input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` returns the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified that `func_1` does not account for Nene's optimal strategy.
- The provided example demonstrates that `func_1` incorrectly returns 2 points when the expected output should be 1 point.

Given the analysis, the provided solution is indeed incorrect because it fails to simulate the optimal play of Nene, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of points you can get.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for Nene's optimal strategy, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.
