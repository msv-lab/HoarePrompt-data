To determine what will be printed, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Variables and Their Ranges**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).

2. **Objective**:
   - Find the maximum value between any divisor `i` of `x` and `x//i` where `n` is less than or equal to `i` or `x//i`.

3. **Process**:
   - We need to iterate through all divisors of `x` and check if they satisfy the condition \(n \leq i\) or \(n \leq x//i\).
   - For each valid divisor `i`, we calculate `x//i` and compare it with `i`.
   - We keep track of the maximum value found during this process.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Let's assume specific values for `x` and `n` to illustrate the process.
     - Suppose `x = 12` and `n = 3`.
     - Divisors of `12`: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.
     - Check each divisor:
       - For `i = 1`, `x//i = 12` (not valid since \(3 \not\leq 1\)).
       - For `i = 2`, `x//i = 6` (valid since \(3 \leq 2\) is false but \(3 \leq 6\) is true, so max is 6).
       - For `i = 3`, `x//i = 4` (valid since \(3 \leq 3\) is true, so max is 4).
       - For `i = 4`, `x//i = 3` (valid since \(3 \leq 4\) is true, so max is 4).
       - For `i = 6`, `x//i = 2` (not valid since \(3 \not\leq 6\)).
       - For `i = 12`, `x//i = 1` (not valid since \(3 \not\leq 12\)).

   - The maximum value found is 4.

5. **General Case**:
   - Given the constraints, the maximum value of `ans` will be the highest value of `i` or `x//i` where the condition \(n \leq i\) or \(n \leq x//i\) is satisfied.

Based on the above analysis, the value of `ans` will be the maximum value between any divisor `i` of `x` and `x//i` where `n` is less than or equal to `i` or `x//i`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value between any divisor i of x and x//i where n is less than or equal to i or x//i)**
