Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` are taken from the input split, but `ans` is explicitly set to 0 regardless of the input values. Therefore, `ans` remains 0 after executing the given line of code.
