Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of the list satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns 'Alice' if the length of the set of unique elements in arr is even, and 'Bob' if it's odd.**
