State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `t` being an input integer between 1 and 100 does not guarantee that the loop will execute, as `t` could be 0 or negative.
4. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

Hence, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.
