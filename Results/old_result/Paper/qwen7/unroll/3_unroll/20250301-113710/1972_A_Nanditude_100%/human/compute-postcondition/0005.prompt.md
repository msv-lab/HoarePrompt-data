You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. a and b are lists of length n, where a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t`, followed by `t` lines, each containing an integer `cnt`. The integer `cnt` on each line represents the count of times an element in list `b` is found to be less than the corresponding element in list `a` up to the current index `i` during the inner loop execution for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n` where both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a result based on the comparison of elements in lists `a` and `b`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
