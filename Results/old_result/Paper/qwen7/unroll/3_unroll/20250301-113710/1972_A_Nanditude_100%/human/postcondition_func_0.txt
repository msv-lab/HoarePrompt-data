The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (the size of lists \( a \) and \( b \)), and two sorted lists \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n \). It then counts and prints the number of times an element in list \( b \) is less than the corresponding element in list \( a \) for each test case.
