Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX but does not correctly handle the logic for determining the MEX value for each position `i` in the permutation `p`. Specifically, the program uses `minn` and `maxx` to track the minimum and maximum values seen so far, which is not appropriate for calculating the MEX in this context.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program tries to build the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`, but it does not correctly infer the permutation from the MEX values. The MEX calculation should be done based on the current state of the permutation being built, not just the minimum and maximum values seen so far.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iteratively build the permutation `p` while ensuring that the MEX condition is satisfied. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [-1] * n  # Initialize the permutation with -1
    mex = 0  # Start with the smallest possible MEX value

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            p[i] = mex
            mex += 1
        else:
            p[i] = abs(arr[i])
            while p[i] in p[:i]:
                p[i] += 1
            mex = max(mex, p[i] + 1)

    for item in p:
        print(item, end=' ')
    print()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize the permutation `p` with `-1` and start with `mex = 0`.
2. **Building the Permutation**:
   - For each index `i`, if `arr[i]` is non-negative, we set `p[i]` to the current `mex` and increment `mex`.
   - If `arr[i]` is negative, we set `p[i]` to the absolute value of `arr[i]`. We then ensure that `p[i]` is not already used in the prefix of `p` by incrementing it until a valid value is found.
   - Update `mex` to be the maximum of its current value and the next available value after placing `p[i]`.

This approach ensures that the permutation `p` satisfies the given conditions and is constructed correctly.
