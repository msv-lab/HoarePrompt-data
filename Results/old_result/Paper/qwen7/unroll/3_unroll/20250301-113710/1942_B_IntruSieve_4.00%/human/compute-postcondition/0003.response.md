Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `mex` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `minn` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, or `mex`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
