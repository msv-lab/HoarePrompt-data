You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i, and there exists at least one valid permutation p that satisfies the given conditions.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: Output State: `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `mex` is a list containing differences or `minn` based on conditions, `maxx` is the maximum difference found between elements in `arr` and `minn`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `mex` is a list containing the differences or `minn` based on conditions, `maxx` is the maximum difference found between elements in `arr` and `minn`, the loop prints each element of `mex` separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: minn - a1 minn - a2 ... minn - an
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing through a predefined set of constraints where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5. Additionally, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range of -`n` to `n`, and there exists at least one valid permutation `p` that satisfies certain conditions. The function returns a result based on these constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
