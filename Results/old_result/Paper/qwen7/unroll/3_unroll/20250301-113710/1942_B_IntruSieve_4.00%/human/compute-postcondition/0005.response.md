Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function which involves the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will start with `i` being 0 (the default value when no starting value is specified).
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `total` is not involved in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `t` is not involved in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` will start at 0, but since this is the initial state before the loop starts, we don't need to explicitly mention it unless it affects the loop condition.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and the initial value of `i` (which is 0).

**Final State**:
State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is an empty list, `maxx` is 0**
