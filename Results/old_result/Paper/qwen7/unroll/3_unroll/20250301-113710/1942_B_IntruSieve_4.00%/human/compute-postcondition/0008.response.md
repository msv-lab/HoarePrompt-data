Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Objects in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `itm` which iterates over the list `mex`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `itm`**: Since `itm` is iterating over the list `mex`, before the loop starts, `itm` should be set to the first element of `mex`.

3. **Consider the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `mex` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `minn` is already greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, so no adjustment is needed for this.
   - `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged, so no adjustments are needed for these either.
   - `mex` is a list containing differences or `minn` based on conditions, and `itm` will be set to the first element of `mex`.
   - `maxx` is the maximum difference found between elements in `arr` and `minn`, so no adjustment is needed for this.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `itm` being set to the first element of `mex`.

**Final State:**
State: **`itm` is the first element of `mex`, `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `mex` is a list containing differences or `minn` based on conditions, `maxx` is the maximum difference found between elements in `arr` and `minn`**
