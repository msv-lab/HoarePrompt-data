Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `x` < `n` â‰¤ 10^9, `M` is a list containing one element which is `w`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `M` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `M` now contains `[w]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
