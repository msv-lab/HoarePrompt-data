Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: 
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but according to the problem, `y` should be `2 * n - x`. This is because the position `x` is within a cycle of length `2k-2`, and the formula to find the corresponding `k` involves adjusting `x` to fit into a complete cycle.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x-1`. However, the logic for determining valid `k` values needs to be more precise. Specifically, the function should check if `q` (which is `(y-2)//2`) can be expressed as `k-1` or `2k-2-k+1`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is very close to `n` or when `x` is small compared to `n`.

4. **Set Conversion**:
   - Converting the list `L1` to a set and then back to a list is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results due to potential duplicate removal.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    y = 2 * n - x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    y //= 2
    for k in range(x-1, y+1):
        if (2*k - 2) % (2*n - x) == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Calculate `y`**: 
   - `y = 2 * n - x` to correctly align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Loop through Possible `k` Values**:
   - Loop through possible values of `k` starting from `x-1` to `y` (inclusive).
   - Check if `(2*k - 2)` is divisible by `(2*n - x)` to ensure the settling pattern fits.

3. **Count Valid `k` Values**:
   - Increment `ans` for each valid `k`.

This approach ensures that the code correctly identifies all possible values of `k` that satisfy the given constraints.
