Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `x` < `n` â‰¤ 10^9, `M` is a list containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to `w-1` (since `int(w // 1)` is equivalent to `w` for integer `w`). For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `q` is divisible by `i`. If it is, and if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `i` to the list `M`. Similarly, if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `q // i` to the list `M`. This means `M` will contain all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
