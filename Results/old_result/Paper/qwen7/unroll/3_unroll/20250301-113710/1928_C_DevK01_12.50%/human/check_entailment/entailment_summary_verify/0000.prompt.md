You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, `q` (an integer) and `x` (an integer). It calculates the integer square root of `q` and stores it in `w`. If `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `w` to the list `M`. Then, it iterates through all integers from 1 to `w` (excluding `w` itself), checking if they are divisors of `q` and adding them to `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Finally, it returns the list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used correctly, and the logic to determine the valid `k` values is flawed.

Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to generate a list of possible `k` values, but it is not being used correctly. The variable `L1` is supposed to store the results from `func_1`, but the logic to filter and count valid `k` values is missing.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but this calculation is not necessary for determining the valid `k` values. Instead, the modulo operation should be used to find the position within the repeating cycle of `2k - 2`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `x` is close to `n`, the program may not correctly identify the valid `k` values.

To fix the program, the following steps are needed:
- Correctly calculate the position within the repeating cycle using modulo.
- Properly use the `func_1` function to generate the list of valid `k` values.
- Ensure that the logic correctly filters and counts the valid `k` values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    # Calculate the position within the repeating cycle
    pos = (n - 1) % (2 * x - 2)
    if pos < x:
        # Check if the position is valid for the given x
        ans = 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version directly calculates the position within the repeating cycle and checks if it is valid, which simplifies the logic and ensures correctness.
