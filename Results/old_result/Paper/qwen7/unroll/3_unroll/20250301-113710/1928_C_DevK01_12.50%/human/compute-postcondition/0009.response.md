Output State: **The program returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`**.

This means that the program returns a list of all divisors of `q` (where `q` is the number of test cases) that are greater than or equal to `w` (since `w` is defined as the integer square root of `q` and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`).
