Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by splitting the input into `n` and `x`.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `y = n + x` is even. If not, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This condition is necessary because the settling pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions, and `y` must be even for a valid `k` to exist.

3. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to find potential values of `k`. The value `(y - 2) // 2` represents half the length of the repeating segment minus 1, adjusted for the initial offset.

4. **Handling Larger `n`**: If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the program calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to consider the additional segment beyond the initial repeating pattern.

5. **Removing Duplicates**: The program converts the list returned by `func_1` to a set and then back to a list to remove duplicates before calculating its length.

6. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. It first checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Then, it iterates through all possible divisors of `q` and adds those that meet the criteria to the list `M`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for finding the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
