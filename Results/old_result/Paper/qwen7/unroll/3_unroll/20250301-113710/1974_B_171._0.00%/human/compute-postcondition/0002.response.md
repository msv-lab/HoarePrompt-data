Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for char in encoded:`. The objects involved here are `char`, `encoded`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - `mapping` is an empty dictionary (though this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `decoded` is an empty list (also not directly relevant to the loop execution).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in the `encoded` string. For the loop to execute, `encoded` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `encoded`, `encoded` must have at least one character for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `char` will take the value of each character in `encoded` during each iteration, starting from the first character.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `encoded` must have at least one character.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character**.
