Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. It decodes the input string by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter and constructs a new string with these letters in the order they appear in the mapping. If a character in `encoded` has not been mapped yet, it assigns the next available lowercase Latin letter to it.**
