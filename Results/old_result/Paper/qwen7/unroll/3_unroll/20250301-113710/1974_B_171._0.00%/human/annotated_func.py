#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s according to the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():

    #State: Output State: `decoded` is a list containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z', each letter appearing exactly once in the order they were mapped; `mapping` is a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of a unique lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' mapped to the corresponding unique character in the `encoded` string, in the order these mappings were established.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z' in order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. It decodes the input string by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter and constructs a new string with these letters in the order they appear in the mapping. If a character in `encoded` has not been mapped yet, it assigns the next available lowercase Latin letter to it.
