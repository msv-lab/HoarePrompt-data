Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the `func_1` function is trying to create a mapping from characters in the alphabet to characters in the encoded string, but it does not correctly reverse the encoding process. Instead of mapping each character in the encoded string back to its corresponding character in the original string, it attempts to fill in the mapping with the next available character in alphabetical order, which is not what is required for decoding.

To correctly decode, you should first identify the unique characters in the encoded string and sort them to form the auxiliary string `r`. Then, you should map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in `r` from the start to the end of `r`.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create the auxiliary string r with unique characters sorted
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Create a mapping from r to itself in reverse order
    mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

This corrected function will properly decode the encoded string according to the problem statement.
