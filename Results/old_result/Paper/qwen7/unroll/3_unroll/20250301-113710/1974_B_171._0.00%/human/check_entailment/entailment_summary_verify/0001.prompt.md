You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Program:
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
    return ''.join(decoded)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. It decodes the input string by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter and constructs a new string with these letters in the order they appear in the mapping. If a character in `encoded` has not been mapped yet, it assigns the next available lowercase Latin letter to it.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`num_cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string itself (`encoded`).

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for decoding the string.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the reverse mapping of characters.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.

3. **Mapping Characters:**
   - For each character in the encoded string, the function checks if it is already in the `mapping`.
     - If it is, the corresponding decoded character is appended to `decoded`.
     - If it is not, the function tries to find a character in the alphabet ('a' to 'z') that is not yet mapped.
       - It iterates through the alphabet and maps the current character to the first available character in the alphabet that is not yet used.
       - This ensures that each character in the encoded string is mapped to exactly one character in the decoded string.

4. **Returning the Decoded String:**
   - After processing all characters in the encoded string, the function joins the list `decoded` into a single string and returns it.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Encoded string: `serofedsoc`
  - Mapping:
    - `s` -> `c`

    - `c` -> `s`
  - Decoded string: `codeforces`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Encoded string: `ttf`
  - Mapping:
    - `t` -> `f`
    - `t` -> `f`
    - `f` -> `t`

    - `m` -> `g`
    - `a` -> `l`
    - `o` -> `o`
    - `i` -> `t`
  - Decoded string: `algorithm`

  - Encoded string: `w`
  - Mapping:
    - `w` -> `w`
  - Decoded string: `w`

  - Encoded string: `hnndledmnhlttin`
  - Mapping:
    - `h` -> `d`
    - `n` -> `l`
    - `n` -> `l`
    - `d` -> `e`
    - `l` -> `m`
    - `e` -> `h`
    - `d` -> `e`
    - `m` -> `n`
    - `n` -> `l`
    - `h` -> `d`
    - `l` -> `m`
    - `t` -> `i`
    - `t` -> `i`
    - `t` -> `i`
  - Decoded string: `meetinthemiddle`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly decodes the encoded strings by maintaining a reverse mapping of characters and ensuring that each character in the encoded string is mapped to the correct character in the decoded string.
