Output State: **The program returns a list of integers called 'results', where each integer represents the sum of counts of residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for each list of integers 'arr' in 'test_cases'. For each tuple (n, x, y, arr) in 'test_cases', the loop calculates the count of unique pairs of residues (r_x, r_y) for every number 'num' in 'arr', where r_x = -num % x and r_y = num % y, and appends the total count to 'results'.**

This means that the program will take the `test_cases` list, which contains tuples of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, and for each such tuple, it will process the list `arr` of integers. It will compute the residues `r_x` and `r_y` for each number in `arr` using the given formulas, count the unique pairs of these residues, and accumulate these counts. The final result for each `arr` will be appended to the `results` list. The `results` list will contain one integer per `arr` in `test_cases`, representing the total count of unique residue pairs across all numbers in `arr`.
