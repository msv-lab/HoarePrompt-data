Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then processes it. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases with large inputs.
2. **Test Case Parsing**: The program correctly parses each test case from the input string, extracting the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. **Residue Calculation**: For each number `num` in the array, it calculates the residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`. This ensures that both conditions for a beautiful pair are checked.
4. **Counting Pairs**: It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the occurrences of each residue pair `(r_x, r_y)`. When it encounters a new pair, it adds the count of that pair to the total count of beautiful pairs.
5. **Appending Results**: After processing each array, the total count of beautiful pairs is appended to the `results` list.
6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

Given that the logic matches the problem description and the execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
