### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the occurrences of pairs of remainders `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it computes `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it increments the count by the value associated with the pair in `residue_map`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair `(r_x, r_y)` and increments its count.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the count to the `results` list.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `r_x = -num % x` is correct. This ensures that `r_x` is always non-negative and less than `x`.
   - The calculation of `r_y = num % y` is also correct.

4. **Dictionary Usage:**
   - The use of `residue_map` to keep track of the pairs `(r_x, r_y)` is appropriate. This allows efficient counting of pairs without needing to compare each pair explicitly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the results for each test case as required.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
