Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
2. It correctly parses the input for each test case, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. The main logic is implemented in the function `func_1` which calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
4. For each element in the array, it computes the remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.
5. It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of how many times each unique pair of remainders has been seen.
6. If a pair of remainders `(r_x, r_y)` is found again, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
7. The program outputs the results for each test case as required.

Given the explanation, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
