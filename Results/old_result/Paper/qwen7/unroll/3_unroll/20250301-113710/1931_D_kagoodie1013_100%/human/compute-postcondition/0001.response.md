State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, (n, x, y, arr) must be a valid tuple from `test_cases`, n must be at least 1, x and y are integers, and arr is a list of n integers**.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `(n, x, y, arr)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one tuple in `test_cases` that can be unpacked into `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - Each tuple in `test_cases` must contain four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - `n` must be at least 1 because the list `arr` should have at least one element.
   - `x` and `y` are integers.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - Ensure that `test_cases` is a non-empty list containing valid tuples.
   - Ensure that the first tuple in `test_cases` (or any tuple if multiple) has `n` as at least 1.
   - Ensure that `x` and `y` are integers.
   - Ensure that `arr` is a list of `n` integers.

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute is:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
- `results` is an empty list.
- `(n, x, y, arr)` must be a valid tuple from `test_cases`.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers.
