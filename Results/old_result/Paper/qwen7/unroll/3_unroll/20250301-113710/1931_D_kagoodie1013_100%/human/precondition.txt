test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. The size of the array n satisfies 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and x, y satisfy 1 <= x, y <= 10^9. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
