### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Residue Calculation:**
   - For each number `num` in the array, the program calculates two residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x`: This ensures that `r_x` is non-negative and less than `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y`: This is straightforward and ensures `r_y` is non-negative and less than `y`.
   - The program uses these residues to check if there exists another number in the array such that their sum and difference meet the conditions specified in the problem.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - A dictionary `residue_map` is used to keep track of the counts of each pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - For each number `num`, the program checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before in the array. If so, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
   - The program also updates the count of the current residue pair in the `residue_map`.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of a dictionary to store residues allows for efficient counting of pairs.
   - The program iterates through the array only once, making it efficient in terms of time complexity.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement, including when `x` and `y` are large and the array elements are within the specified range.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The use of residues and the dictionary ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all potential cases as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem statement.
