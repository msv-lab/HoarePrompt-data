Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration defined by the variable `t`. For each iteration, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are read from input, and the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether certain conditions are met. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' will vary based on the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` provided during each iteration.
