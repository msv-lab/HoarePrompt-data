The function processes a series of inputs where `t` specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. Based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`, it determines whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'. Specifically, if `x < k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, or if `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all iterations, the function concludes without returning any value.
