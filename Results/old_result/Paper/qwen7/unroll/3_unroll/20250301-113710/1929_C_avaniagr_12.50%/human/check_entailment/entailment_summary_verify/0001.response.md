### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for Winning:**
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k` and `x` to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal of having an unlimited number of coins.

3. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \):**
   - If `x` (maximum number of consecutive losses) is less than `k - 1` (number of times the bet is increased in case of a win minus one), the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - If `a >= x + 1`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - **Analysis:** This condition is correct because if Sasha can afford to lose up to `x` times in a row, and he starts with enough coins to cover these losses plus one additional bet, he can always recover and continue betting. However, the original assessment did not fully consider the implications of this condition. Specifically, the program should ensure that Sasha can always recover from losing `x` times in a row, and the condition `a >= x + 1` is not sufficient for all cases.

4. **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \):**
   - If `x` equals `k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.
   - If `a >= x + 3`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - **Analysis:** This condition is correct because if Sasha can afford to lose `k - 1` times in a row, and he starts with enough coins to cover these losses plus two additional bets, he can always recover and continue betting. However, the original assessment did not fully consider the implications of this condition either. Specifically, the program should ensure that Sasha can always recover from losing `k - 1` times in a row, and the condition `a >= x + 3` is not sufficient for all cases.

5. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \):**
   - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, the program calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row.
   - It uses a loop to calculate `z` as the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations.
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - **Analysis:** This condition is correct because it ensures that Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row, given the constraints of the problem. However, the original assessment did not fully consider the implications of this calculation. Specifically, the program should ensure that Sasha can always recover from losing `x` times in a row, and the calculation of `z` might not be sufficient for all cases.

### Conclusion

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment did not fully consider the implications of the conditions and the calculations in the program. The program's logic is generally correct, but there are edge cases that need to be carefully considered to ensure the program works for all possible inputs.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
