Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**.

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `t`. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input for `t` must be within the range 1 to 1000.
