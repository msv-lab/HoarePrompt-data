Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where it receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each of these t test cases, it receives an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns information based on the given data for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns specific information based on the provided data, without directly accepting any parameters within its function definition.
