Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, ans represents the number of times y was updated (i.e., the number of distinct values in the list a_1, a_2, …, a_n that are greater than both x and y).
