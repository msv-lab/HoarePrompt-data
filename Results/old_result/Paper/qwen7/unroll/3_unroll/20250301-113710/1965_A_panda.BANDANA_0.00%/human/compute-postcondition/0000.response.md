Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the code only updates `t` to be the input integer, the output state remains that `t` is an input integer within the specified range.
