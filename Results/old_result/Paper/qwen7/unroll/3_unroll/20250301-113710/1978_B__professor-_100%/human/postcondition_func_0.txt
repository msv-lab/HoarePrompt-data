The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three positive integers: the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun (b). For each test case, it calculates the total cost of buying n buns under specific pricing conditions. If the price of the first bun (b) is less than or equal to the usual price (a), it calculates the total cost as n times a. If the difference between b and a is greater than or equal to n, it calculates the total cost using the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. Otherwise, it uses the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` to calculate the total cost. The function outputs the calculated total cost for each test case.
