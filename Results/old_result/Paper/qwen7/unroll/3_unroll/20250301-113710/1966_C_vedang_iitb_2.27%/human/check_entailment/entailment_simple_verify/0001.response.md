### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions do not correctly implement the Nim-sum logic, which is crucial for determining the winner in this game. Let's break down the issues and verify the solution step-by-step.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and computes a modified list `a_new`. However, this function does not contribute to the correct solution of the game.
   - The purpose of `func_1` is unclear and does not align with the game logic.

2. **Incorrect Implementation of `func_2`**:
   - The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` are correct but do not cover all necessary scenarios.
   - The recursive case does not correctly apply the Nim-sum logic. Instead, it uses a recursive approach to determine the winner, which is not optimal and does not handle all edge cases.

3. **Nim-Sum Logic Missing**:
   - The game can be solved using the Nim-sum (XOR of the sizes of the piles). If the Nim-sum is zero, the position is a losing position; otherwise, it is a winning position.
   - The provided functions do not compute the Nim-sum and instead rely on a recursive approach, which is not sufficient.

#### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, we should implement the Nim-sum logic as follows:

```python
def nim_sum(piles):
    xor_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        xor_sum ^= pile
    return xor_sum

def determine_winner(piles):
    xor_sum = nim_sum(piles)
    if xor_sum == 0:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        return "Alice"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    print(determine_winner(a))
```

This solution correctly computes the Nim-sum of the piles and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis and the correct solution provided above, the original program is indeed incorrect because it does not implement the Nim-sum logic correctly.

**Final: False**
