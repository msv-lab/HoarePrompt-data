Reasoning:
The provided program seems to follow the problem description accurately. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the list of integers (`test_cases`). This part is handled by the `input()` calls and the list comprehension within the `func_1` function.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates over each `x` in `test_cases`.
   - For each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible `y` values from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd`.
   - It computes the sum of the GCD and `y`.
   - If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`.
   - It breaks out of the loop early once it finds the first such `y` that maximizes the sum, ensuring efficiency.

3. **Output**: The program prints the `best_y` for each `x` in the required format.

Given that the logic inside the `func_1` function matches the problem requirements and the overall structure handles the input and output correctly, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
