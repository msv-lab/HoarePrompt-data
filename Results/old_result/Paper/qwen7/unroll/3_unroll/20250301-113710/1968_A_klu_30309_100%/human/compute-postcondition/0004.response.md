Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' where each element corresponds to the best 'y' value for each 'x' in 'test_cases'. The best 'y' value is the one that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of 'x' and 'y' plus 'y'.**

This means that for each 'x' in 'test_cases', the program finds the 'y' that gives the highest possible value when added to the greatest common divisor of 'x' and 'y'. The list 'results' contains these optimal 'y' values in the same order as their corresponding 'x' values in 'test_cases'.
