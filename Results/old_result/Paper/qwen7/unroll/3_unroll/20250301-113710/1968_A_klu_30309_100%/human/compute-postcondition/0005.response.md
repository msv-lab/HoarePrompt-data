Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it calculates the best `y` value that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y`. It then returns a list named 'results' containing these best `y` values for each `x` in `test_cases`.**
