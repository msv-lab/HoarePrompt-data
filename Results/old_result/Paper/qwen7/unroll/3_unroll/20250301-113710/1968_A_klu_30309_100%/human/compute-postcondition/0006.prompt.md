You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`, where the best `y` is determined as the value that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' where each element corresponds to the best 'y' value for each 'x' in 'test_cases'. The best 'y' value is the one that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of 'x' and 'y' plus 'y'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it calculates the best `y` value that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y`. It then returns a list named 'results' containing these best `y` values for each `x` in `test_cases`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'results' where each element corresponds to the best 'y' value for each 'x' in 'test_cases'. The best 'y' value is the one that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of 'x' and 'y' plus 'y'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
