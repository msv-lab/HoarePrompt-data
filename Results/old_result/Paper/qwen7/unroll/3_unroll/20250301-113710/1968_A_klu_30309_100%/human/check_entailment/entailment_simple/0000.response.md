Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the values of `x` for each test case from the input.
2. The `func_1` function iterates through each test case and finds the value of `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x`.
3. The logic inside the function is sound:
   - It initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
   - It checks if the current sum of GCD and `y` is greater than the previously recorded maximum sum.
   - If it is, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current `y`, then breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary further calculations.
   - This ensures that the first `y` that gives the maximum sum is found and stored.
   - After processing all `y` values for a given `x`, it appends the `best_y` to the `results` list.
4. The function returns the `results` list, which contains the optimal `y` values for each `x`.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be logically correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
