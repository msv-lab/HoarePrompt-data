Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied. This involves checking the balance of residents (0s and 1s) on the left and right sides of the chosen position.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the number of houses `n` and the binary string `a`.
   - It initializes a list `S` to keep track of the cumulative counts of 0s and 1s up to each house.
   - For each house, it updates the counts of 0s and 1s and stores them in `S`.
   - It then iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road there satisfies the conditions:
     - At least half of the residents on the left side (`left * 2 < lsum`) should be 0s.
     - At least half of the residents on the right side (`right * 2 < rsum`) should be 1s.
   - If these conditions are met, it checks if this position is closer to the center of the village than the current best position `ans`. If it is, it updates `ans`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for updating `S` correctly accumulates the counts of 0s and 1s.
   - The conditions for satisfaction are correctly checked.
   - The logic for choosing the closest valid position is also correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the entire village might be on one side (all 0s or all 1s).
   - It correctly identifies the smallest valid position that minimizes the distance from the center.

5. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function runs `func_1` for each test case, which is necessary given the multiple test cases.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
