Output State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing `n` sublists, where the first sublist is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` has `x` equal to the number of '0's encountered so far in `a` up to but not including the current character, and `y` equal to the number of '1's encountered so far in `a` up to but not including the current character; `ans` is the index `i` that satisfies the condition in the loop (or remains 0 if no such index exists); `satisfy` is 0.
