Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the outcome of the game between Alice and Bob based on the given rules. Let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem statement and the expected outputs.

1. **Initial Conditions Check**: 
   - If `x_a > x_b` or if `h == 1`, the game is a draw (`Draw`).
   - This condition is correctly implemented.

2. **Parity Check**:
   - If both `x_a` and `x_b` are even or both are odd, we need to further check the relative positions of `y_a` and `y_b`.
   - The program checks if `y_a` and `y_b` are equal. If they are, Bob wins (`Bob`). This is correct.
   - If `y_a < y_b`, the program checks if the absolute difference between `y_a` and `y_b` is greater than 1. If so, the game is a draw. Otherwise, Bob wins. This part is also correct.
   - If `y_a > y_b`, similar checks are performed. This is also correct.

3. **Unequal Y Positions**:
   - If `y_a` and `y_b` are not equal, Alice wins (`Alice`). This is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the differences in coordinates might affect the outcome. These checks seem to cover most scenarios, but there could be some edge cases that are not fully covered.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case as expected.

Given the detailed analysis, the program seems to follow the rules and logic described in the problem statement. The provided examples and the expected outputs match the logic implemented in the code.

Correctness: **True**
