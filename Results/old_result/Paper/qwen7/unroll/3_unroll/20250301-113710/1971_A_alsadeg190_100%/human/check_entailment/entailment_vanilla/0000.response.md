Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func()` is defined but not called. This is irrelevant for determining the correctness of the logic since we are focusing on the logic inside the function.

2. **Reading Input Count**: 
   ```python
   x = int(input())
   ```
   This line reads an integer from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   ```python
   for i in range(x):
       (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   - The loop runs `x` times, where `x` is the number of test cases.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers and splits them into a list, then unpacks the list into `x` and `y`.

4. **Determine Minimum and Maximum**:
   ```python
   if x < y:
       print(x, y)
   else:
       print(y, x)
   ```
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

### Testing the Logic:

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- For the first test case: `1 9`
  - `x = 1` and `y = 9`
  - Since `1 < 9`, it should print `1 9`.

- For the second test case: `8 4`
  - `x = 8` and `y = 4`
  - Since `4 < 8`, it should print `4 8`.

- For the third test case: `1 4`
  - `x = 1` and `y = 4`
  - Since `1 < 4`, it should print `1 4`.

- For the fourth test case: `3 4`
  - `x = 3` and `y = 4`
  - Since `3 < 4`, it should print `3 4`.

- For the fifth test case: `2 0`
  - `x = 2` and `y = 0`
  - Since `0 < 2`, it should print `0 2`.

- For the sixth test case: `2 4`
  - `x = 2` and `y = 4`
  - Since `2 < 4`, it should print `2 4`.

- For the seventh test case: `6 9`
  - `x = 6` and `y = 9`
  - Since `6 < 9`, it should print `6 9`.

- For the eighth test case: `3 3`
  - `x = 3` and `y = 3`
  - Since `3 == 3`, it should print `3 3`.

- For the ninth test case: `0 0`
  - `x = 0` and `y = 0`
  - Since `0 == 0`, it should print `0 0`.

- For the tenth test case: `9 9`
  - `x = 9` and `y = 9`
  - Since `9 == 9`, it should print `9 9`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers and prints them in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
