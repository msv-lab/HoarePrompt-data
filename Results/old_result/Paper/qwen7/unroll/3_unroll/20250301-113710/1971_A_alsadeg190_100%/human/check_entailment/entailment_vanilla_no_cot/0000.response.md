Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem statement. The issue lies in how the program processes the test cases. Specifically:

- The program reads `x` at the beginning but then uses `x` and `y` within the loop without reassigning them.
- It should read `t` (the number of test cases) first, then process each test case individually.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the pair of integers for each test case
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This corrected version will properly read the number of test cases first (`t`) and then process each test case individually, ensuring that the program behaves as expected according to the problem statement.
