Output State: The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged, and the output consists of pairs of integers printed on separate lines based on the condition given in the loop. Specifically, for each iteration `i` in the range of `x`, if the first number entered is less than the second number, those numbers are printed in ascending order; otherwise, they are printed in descending order.
