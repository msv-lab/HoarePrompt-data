Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Segment Identification**: The program identifies segments within the array `nums` where consecutive elements are identical. For each such segment, it stores the start index (`s`), end index (`e`), and the value of the segment in the list `arr`. This ensures that each segment is uniquely identifiable by its start and end indices.

2. **Query Processing**: For each query defined by the pair of indices `(l, r)`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr` that covers the query interval `[l, r)`. If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the segment fully covers the query interval. If the segment ends before `r`, it prints the start and end indices of the segment. Otherwise, it prints `-1, -1`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the segment starts at the beginning of the query interval or when the segment ends at the end of the query interval. It also handles the case where no suitable segment is found.

4. **Input/Output Handling**: The program reads input from standard input and writes output to standard output, as required by the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
