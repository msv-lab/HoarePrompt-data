### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the logic to find distinct elements within the queried ranges. Let's break down the key points to ensure the program is indeed correct:

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments where consecutive elements are the same using a loop. This is done by iterating through the array and appending segments to `arr` whenever a new unique element is encountered.
   - The segments are stored as tuples containing the start index (adjusted by 1), the end index, and the value of the segment.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary `l`.
   - Based on the position of the segment relative to the query boundaries, the program determines whether there are two distinct elements within the queried range:
     - If the segment starts before the query range but ends after, it means there are distinct elements.
     - If the segment starts after the query range, there are no distinct elements.
     - If the segment ends before the query range, there are no distinct elements.
     - If the segment ends exactly at the query range, it depends on the exact positions.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly:
     - If the segment starts at the beginning of the query range, it checks if the segment extends beyond the query range.
     - If the segment ends at the end of the query range, it ensures the segment is fully within the query range.
     - If the segment is completely within the query range, it provides the correct indices.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the correct indices for distinct elements or `-1 -1` if no such elements exist.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct handling of all aspects of the problem, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct and implements the required functionality accurately.
