Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and N is the integer input from `sys.stdin.readline`.**

In this output state, the variable `N` is assigned the value of the integer input from `sys.stdin.readline`, while all other variables retain their initial conditions.
