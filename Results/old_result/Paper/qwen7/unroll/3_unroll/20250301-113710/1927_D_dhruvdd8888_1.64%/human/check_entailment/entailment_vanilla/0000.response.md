Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then processes each query.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the array `nums` is processed to identify segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - These segments are stored in the list `arr` along with their start (`s`) and end (`e`) indices and the value (`num`).

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary `l`.
   - Based on the position of the segment relative to the query boundaries, it determines whether there are two distinct elements within the queried range.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The code correctly identifies segments where consecutive elements are the same and stores them in `arr`.
   - This helps in quickly finding segments that might contain distinct elements within the queried range.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find the appropriate segment.
   - The logic for determining the result based on the segment positions is correct:
     - If the segment starts before the query range but ends after, it means there are distinct elements.
     - If the segment starts after the query range, there are no distinct elements.
     - If the segment ends before the query range, there are no distinct elements.
     - If the segment ends exactly at the query range, it depends on the exact positions.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when the segment starts at the beginning or end of the query range correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the segment is completely within the query range and provides the correct indices.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to find distinct elements within the queried ranges. The handling of segments and the binary search are appropriately implemented.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
