You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of queries on an input array `nums`. It first identifies segments within the array where consecutive elements are identical, storing the start and end indices of these segments along with the value. Then, for each query defined by a pair of indices `(l, r)`, it determines whether the interval `[l, r)` falls entirely within any of the identified segments. If so, it prints the start and end indices of the segment; otherwise, it prints `-1, -1`. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then processes each query.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the array `nums` is processed to identify segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - These segments are stored in the list `arr` along with their start (`s`) and end (`e`) indices and the value (`num`).

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary `l`.
   - Based on the position of the segment relative to the query boundaries, it determines whether there are two distinct elements within the queried range.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The code correctly identifies segments where consecutive elements are the same and stores them in `arr`.
   - This helps in quickly finding segments that might contain distinct elements within the queried range.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find the appropriate segment.
   - The logic for determining the result based on the segment positions is correct:
     - If the segment starts before the query range but ends after, it means there are distinct elements.
     - If the segment starts after the query range, there are no distinct elements.
     - If the segment ends before the query range, there are no distinct elements.
     - If the segment ends exactly at the query range, it depends on the exact positions.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when the segment starts at the beginning or end of the query range correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the segment is completely within the query range and provides the correct indices.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to find distinct elements within the queried ranges. The handling of segments and the binary search are appropriately implemented.
