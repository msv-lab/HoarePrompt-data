Reasoning:

1. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants based on their preferences.
2. The given program correctly handles the conditions specified:
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone, contributing \(a\) tents.
   - Extroverts prefer to share a tent with two others, which can be accommodated by dividing \(b + c\) by 3.
   - Universals can adjust to any situation, helping to fill incomplete tents.
3. The program checks if it's possible to accommodate extroverts and universals in groups of three. If not, it prints \(-1\).
4. The logic for calculating the number of tents is correct:
   - `k += a` accounts for introverts needing individual tents.
   - `(b + c) // 3` accounts for complete groups of three people.
   - If there are leftover people after forming complete groups (i.e., `(b + c) % 3 != 0`), an additional tent is needed.
5. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the conditions for printing \(-1\) are met.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
