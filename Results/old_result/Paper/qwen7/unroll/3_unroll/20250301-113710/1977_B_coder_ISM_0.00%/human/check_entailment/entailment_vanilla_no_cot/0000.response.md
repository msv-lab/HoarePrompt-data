Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Initial Binary Representation Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the binary representation of `x` but does not ensure that the resulting array adheres to the constraints (no two consecutive non-zero elements).

2. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
   - The logic to handle consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. It tries to replace `-1` with `0` and vice versa, but this does not guarantee that no two consecutive non-zero elements will exist.

3. **Incorrect Length Calculation**:
   - The length of the array is fixed at 30, but the problem allows for lengths up to 32. This means the code will fail for numbers that require more than 30 bits to represent.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Ensuring No Two Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
   - The logic for ensuring no two consecutive non-zero elements is overly complex and does not correctly handle all edge cases.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        # Convert x to its binary representation and pad with leading zeros
        binary_representation = format(x, '032b')
        
        # Convert binary string to list of integers
        a = [int(bit) for bit in binary_representation]
        
        # Ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] != 0 and a[i-1] != 0:
                a[i] = 0
        
        # Output the length and the array
        print(len(a))
        print(" ".join(map(str, a)))

func()
```

This solution:
1. Converts the integer `x` to its binary representation using `format(x, '032b')`.
2. Converts the binary string to a list of integers.
3. Ensures no two consecutive non-zero elements by iterating through the list and setting consecutive non-zero elements to zero.
4. Outputs the length and the array.
