Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), where for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks are provided. The function returns information based on these inputs.**
