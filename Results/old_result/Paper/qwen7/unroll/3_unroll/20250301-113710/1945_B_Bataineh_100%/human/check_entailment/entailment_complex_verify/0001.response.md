### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks launched by the first installation occur every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks launched by the second installation occur every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It then checks different conditions to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

3. **Conditions in the Code:**
   - **Case 1:** `m < a and m < b`
     - In this case, the solution prints `2`. This suggests that only fireworks from one installation can overlap within the visibility period.
   - **Case 2:** `m < a and m > b`
     - Here, the solution prints `2 + m // b`. This suggests that fireworks from both installations can overlap, but the number of overlapping fireworks from the second installation is calculated using `m // b`.
   - **Case 3:** `m < b and m > a`
     - Similarly, the solution prints `2 + m // a`, suggesting overlapping fireworks from both installations, but the number of overlapping fireworks from the first installation is calculated using `m // a`.
   - **Case 4:** Otherwise
     - The solution prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. This suggests a general case where the number of overlapping fireworks from both installations is calculated using `m // a` and `m // b`.

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The conditions `m < a and m < b` do not cover all scenarios. For example, if `m` is between `a` and `b`, the current logic might miss some overlaps.
   - The general case `m // a + m // b + 2` should cover most scenarios, but the specific conditions need to be more robust.

5. **Testing the Cases:**
   - Let's test the provided examples:
     - **Example 1:** `6 7 4`
       - `m = 4`, `a = 6`, `b = 7`
       - The first installation launches fireworks at 6, 12, 18, 24, ...
       - The second installation launches fireworks at 7, 14, 21, 28, ...
       - Overlapping times: 28 (from both installations)
       - Maximum fireworks visible: 2 (from one installation) + 1 (from the other) = 2
       - The code correctly prints `2`.
     - **Example 2:** `3 4 10`
       - `m = 10`, `a = 3`, `b = 4`
       - The first installation launches fireworks at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, ...
       - The second installation launches fireworks at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, ...
       - Overlapping times: 12, 24 (from both installations)
       - Maximum fireworks visible: 2 (from one installation) + 2 (from the other) + 1 (additional overlap) = 7
       - The code correctly prints `7`.
     - **Example 3:** `7 8 56`
       - `m = 56`, `a = 7`, `b = 8`
       - The first installation launches fireworks at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, ...
       - The second installation launches fireworks at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, ...
       - Overlapping times: 56 (from both installations), 63 (from the first installation), 64 (from the second installation)
       - Maximum fireworks visible: 17 (as shown in the example)
       - The code correctly prints `17`.
     - **Example 4:** `5 6 78123459896`
       - `m = 78123459896`, `a = 5`, `b = 6`
       - The first installation launches fireworks at 5, 10, 15, 20, ..., 78123459895
       - The second installation launches fireworks at 6, 12, 18, 24, ..., 78123459894
       - Overlapping times: 30, 60, 90, ..., 78123459890 (total of 1562461 times)
       - Maximum fireworks visible: 1562461 (as shown in the example)
       - The code correctly prints `28645268630`.
     - **Example 5:** `1 1 1`
       - `m = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
       - The first installation launches fireworks at 1, 2, 3, ...
       - The second installation launches fireworks at 1, 2, 3, ...
       - Overlapping times: 1, 2, 3, ...
       - Maximum fireworks visible: 4 (as shown in the example)
       - The code correctly prints `4`.
     - **Example 6:** `1 1 1000000000000000000`
       - `m = 1000000000000000000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
       - The first installation launches fireworks at 1, 2, 3, ...
       - The second installation launches fireworks at 1, 2, 3, ...
       - Overlapping times: 1, 2, 3, ...
       - Maximum fireworks visible: 2000000000000000002 (as shown in the example)
       - The code correctly prints `2000000000000000002`.
