Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four integers: t, a, b, and m. It verifies that t is within the range 1 to 10^4 and that a, b, and m are within the range 1 to 10^18. For each test case, it prints an integer based on the comparison between m, a, and b. Specifically, it prints 2 if m is less than both a and b, 2 + m // b if m is less than a but greater than b, 2 + m // a if m is less than b but greater than a, and m // a + m // b + 2 otherwise.**
