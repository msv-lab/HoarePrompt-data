Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that each extrovert requires a tent with two others, and it does not properly distribute the remaining universals after assigning tents to introverts and extroverts. 

Consider the following test case:
```
1
1 2 2
```

According to the problem description:
- 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
- 2 extroverts need 1 tent (since 2 extroverts can share a tent).
- 2 universals can share the remaining space.

The correct answer should be 2 tents (1 for the introvert and 1 for the 2 extroverts and 1 universal).

However, the program outputs -1 because it checks if `(b + c) % 3 != 0` and prints -1 without considering the distribution of universals correctly. This means the program fails to handle this specific case correctly.
