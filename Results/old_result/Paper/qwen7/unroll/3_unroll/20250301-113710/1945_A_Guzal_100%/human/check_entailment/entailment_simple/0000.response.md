Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The logic to calculate the minimum number of tents is as follows:
   - Each introvert (`a`) requires 1 tent.
   - Extroverts (`b`) prefer to share a tent with 2 others, but if this is not possible, they will take a separate tent.
   - Universals (`c`) can share a tent with anyone.
4. The program checks if the remaining participants after assigning tents to introverts can be accommodated based on the preferences of extroverts and universals.
5. The formula used to calculate the number of tents is:
   - `k += a + (b + c) // 3`: This accounts for the introverts and the maximum number of groups of 3 people that can be formed from the remaining participants.
   - If there are any remaining participants after forming complete groups of 3, an additional tent is required: `if (b + c) % 3 != 0: k += 1`.
6. The program correctly handles the edge case where it's impossible to form a group of 3 with the remaining extroverts and universals, which results in printing `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
