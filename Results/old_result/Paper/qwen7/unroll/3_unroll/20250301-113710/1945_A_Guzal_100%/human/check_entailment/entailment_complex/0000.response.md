Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
3. The program checks if it's possible to accommodate the extroverts and remaining participants using the given constraints:
   - If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means there are leftover extroverts that cannot form a group of 3, making it impossible to accommodate everyone. Hence, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents required:
     - `a` introverts need individual tents, contributing `a` to `k`.
     - Extroverts and universals can share tents. Each group of 3 people occupies one tent, so `(b + c) // 3` tents are needed for these groups.
     - If there are leftover people (`(b + c) % 3 != 0`), one more tent is needed for them.
4. The program correctly updates and prints the value of `k` for each test case.
5. The overall logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
