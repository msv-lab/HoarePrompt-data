You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        s = list(string)
        n = len(s)
        done = False
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        x = s[0]
        if x != s[-1]:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information when appropriate. If the conditions are met, it also prints indices or substrings of `s`. The final output consists of all printed lines for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a string of length 1 cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO". However, the program does not handle this case uniformly. Specifically, it checks `if n == 1:` and prints "NO" without considering whether the single character is a palindrome. This check should be sufficient, but the program's logic around it is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Non-Palindromic Strings**: The program attempts to check if the first character is different from the last character and considers this as a valid partition. However, this approach is overly simplistic and fails in certain cases. For example, consider the string "aab". The program would incorrectly identify this as a valid partition because 'a' is not equal to 'b', but the entire string "aab" is not a palindrome. A more robust approach is needed to ensure that no substring is a palindrome.

3. **Incomplete Partitioning Logic**: The program's logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings is incomplete. It only checks for the first mismatch and does not explore other possible partitions. For instance, in the string "aab", the program should recognize that "aa" and "b" are valid partitions, but it fails to do so.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle cases where the string consists of repeated characters in a way that makes it impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings. For example, the string "aaaaa" should result in "NO" because any partition will include palindromic substrings.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
