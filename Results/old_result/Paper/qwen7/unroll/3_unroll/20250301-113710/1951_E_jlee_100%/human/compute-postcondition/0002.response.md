Output State: The output state depends on the input integer `t` and the strings provided as input within each iteration of the loop. For each input string, the program checks various conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if 'YES' is printed. The final output state will consist of multiple lines, each representing the output of one iteration of the loop, either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by the appropriate details if applicable.
