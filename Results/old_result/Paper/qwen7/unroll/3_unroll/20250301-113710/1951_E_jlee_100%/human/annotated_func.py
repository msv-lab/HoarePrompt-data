#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input integer `t` and the strings provided in each iteration of the loop. For each input string, the program checks specific conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if 'YES' is printed. The final output state will consist of all the printed lines from each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information when appropriate. If the conditions are met, it also prints indices or substrings of `s`. The final output consists of all printed lines for each test case.
