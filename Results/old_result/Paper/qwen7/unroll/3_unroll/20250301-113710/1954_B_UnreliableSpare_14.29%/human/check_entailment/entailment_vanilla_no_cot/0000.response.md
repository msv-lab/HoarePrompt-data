Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not properly defined**: The function `func_1` is called in the main loop but is never defined before use. This will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for determining if the array is beautiful**: The logic to check if the array is beautiful is flawed. It only checks if all elements are the same, which is not sufficient. The problem specifies that you can perform a specific operation to make the array beautiful, and the code does not account for this.

3. **Counting the minimum removals**: The logic to count the minimum number of elements to remove is also incorrect. The current implementation assumes that the array is already beautiful and tries to find the minimum number of consecutive non-identical elements, which is not the correct approach.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest segment where all elements are the same
        max_same_segment = 0
        current_same_count = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                current_same_count += 1
            else:
                max_same_segment = max(max_same_segment, current_same_count)
                current_same_count = 1
        
        max_same_segment = max(max_same_segment, current_same_count)
        
        # If the entire array is the same, it cannot be made un-beautiful
        if max_same_segment == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The minimum number of elements to remove is the total length minus the longest segment
            print(n - max_same_segment)
```

This corrected version:
1. Determines the longest segment where all elements are the same.
2. If the entire array is the same, it outputs `-1`.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove as the total length of the array minus the length of the longest segment of identical elements.
