Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to distribute the purchases across the stalls does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Instead, it tries to find a way to distribute the coins among the stalls such that the number of jewels bought is close to `k`, but it does not guarantee that the exact number of jewels `k` will be bought.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  255 8
  ```

The expected output should be:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```

However, the provided program might not produce this output because it does not correctly handle the distribution of coins to ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. For instance, if the program calculates the number of jewels to buy from each stall in a way that does not align with the exact requirement of buying 8 jewels, it will fail to meet the criteria.

A correct solution would involve setting up stalls with specific prices that force Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels, regardless of the initial number of coins `n`. The current implementation does not guarantee this behavior.
