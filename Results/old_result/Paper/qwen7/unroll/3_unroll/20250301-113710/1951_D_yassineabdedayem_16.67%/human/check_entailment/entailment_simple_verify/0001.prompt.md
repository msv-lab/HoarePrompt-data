You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

    #State: The output state depends on the input values of `n` and `k` for each iteration. If `n` becomes zero before `k` reaches zero or `rep` reaches 60, it prints 'YES' followed by the length of `tab` and the elements in `tab`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The value of `t` will be the number of such iterations performed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, which represent the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Variables `rep` (representing the number of stalls) and `number` (representing the number of jewels Alice buys from the current stall) are initialized.
   - An empty list `tab` is used to store the prices of the stalls.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, the number of stalls `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It calculates `Min` and `Max` values:
       - `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
       - `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
     - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and reduces `k` by `Max`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`.
     - Appends `number` to `tab` and updates `n` by subtracting `Min * Max`.
     - Increments the stall count `rep`.

4. **Checking if `k` is Zero:**
   - After the loop, if `k` is zero, it prints "YES", the number of stalls `len(tab)`, and the prices stored in `tab`.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than `k` by breaking out of the loop early.
   - The loop ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.

2. **Price Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating `Min` and `Max` values seems correct. It ensures that Alice buys the maximum possible number of jewels from each stall without exceeding her budget.
   - The program correctly updates `n` and `k` after each iteration.

3. **Output Validation:**
   - The output format matches the problem requirements. It prints "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of stalls and the prices if applicable.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It handles all the specified constraints and produces the correct output based on the problem description.
