### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any subsequence of consecutive identical elements.
   - It initializes `same` to count the length of the current sequence of identical elements and `minn` to store the minimum length found.
   - If a different element is encountered, it updates `num` to the new element and resets `same`.
   - After the loop, it prints `-1` if no sequences of identical elements were found, otherwise, it prints the minimum length of such sequences.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array consists entirely of identical elements, the algorithm correctly identifies this and outputs `-1` because removing any element would not make the array non-beautiful.
   - If there are subsequences of identical elements, the algorithm correctly finds the shortest one and outputs its length minus one (since removing one element from this subsequence will break the beauty).

4. **Input Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the input size is manageable, and the array is guaranteed to be beautiful, simplifying the logic.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the problem statement requirements. For arrays that cannot be broken into non-beautiful ones, `-1` is correctly returned. For others, the minimum number of removals needed is calculated accurately.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and input constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
