You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, minn is an integer representing the minimum value of consecutive identical elements in the array a, or -1 if no such sequence exists. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and outputs the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array `a`. If no such sequence exists, it outputs `-1`. The function reads inputs from standard input and prints the results to standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of elements `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence length (`same`), the current number (`num`), and the minimum sequence length found (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array to find sequences of consecutive identical elements.
   - For each sequence, it updates `minn` to be the minimum of itself and the length of the current sequence.
   - After processing the entire array, it prints `-1` if no sequence was found (`minn` is still `inf`), otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of finding sequences of consecutive identical elements is correct.
   - However, the solution does not correctly handle the condition to ensure the array remains beautiful after removing elements.
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty property, but the current implementation only finds the minimum sequence length without considering removals.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the second test case `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the solution correctly identifies the minimum sequence length as 1 but does not account for the fact that removing one element (e.g., the second element) would break the beauty property.
   - For the fourth test case `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the solution incorrectly outputs `3` instead of `2` because it only considers the minimum sequence length without accounting for the removal of elements.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not properly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty property of the array.
