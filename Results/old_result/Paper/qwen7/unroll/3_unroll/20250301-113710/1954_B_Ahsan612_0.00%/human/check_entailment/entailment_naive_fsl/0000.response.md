Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where removing elements is necessary to break the beauty condition.

Let's consider the following example:

Input:
```
5
3
1 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs `-1` because it incorrectly calculates `minn` without properly identifying that removing one element (the middle element `2`) would make the array stop being beautiful.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to `ar[0]`.
2. It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are the same.
3. When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum length of the sequence of identical elements found so far.
4. Finally, it prints `-1` if `minn` remains `inf`, indicating no sequence was found.

This logic fails to correctly identify cases where removing one element is sufficient to break the beauty condition. For instance, in the example `[1, 2, 1]`, the program incorrectly determines that no removal is needed, whereas removing the middle element `2` would make the array stop being beautiful.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify sequences of elements that can be broken by removing a single element and calculate the minimum number of such removals needed.
