Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Minimum Removals**: The current implementation only counts consecutive elements that are the same and finds the minimum length of such sequences. However, this does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that breaks the beauty condition without just counting consecutive elements.

2. **Misunderstanding the Operation**: The problem requires us to find the minimum number of removals such that the array cannot be made uniform through the specified operation. The current code does not handle this requirement properly.

To correctly solve the problem, one approach could be to identify the longest subsequence where the array remains beautiful and subtract this from the total length of the array. If the entire array can be made uniform without any removals, then the answer should be `-1`.

Here is a revised version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest subsequence where the array remains beautiful
        max_beautiful_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if ar[i-1] == ar[i+1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_beautiful_length = max(max_beautiful_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        # If the entire array can be made uniform, return -1
        if max_beautiful_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # Otherwise, the minimum number of removals is the difference between the total length and the max beautiful length
            print(n - max_beautiful_length)

func()
```

This revised solution correctly identifies the longest subsequence that maintains the beauty condition and calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break this condition.
