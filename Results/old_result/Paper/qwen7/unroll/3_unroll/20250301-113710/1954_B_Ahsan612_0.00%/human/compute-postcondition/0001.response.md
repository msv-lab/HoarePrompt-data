Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, minn is an integer representing the minimum value of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array a, or -1 if no such sequence exists.
