Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and outputs the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array `a`. If no such sequence exists, it outputs `-1`. The function reads inputs from standard input and prints the results to standard output.**
