You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each `i` from `0` to `n_cases-1`, the program processes an input `n` and prints either `1`, `2 ** power` where `power` is the smallest integer such that `2 ** power >= n` and `power - 1` otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_cases` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Single Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - If `n` is 1, it directly prints 1 because the array will remain `[1]` with no swaps needed.

3. **Handling Larger `n`**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` using the logarithm base 2.
   - It increments `power` until `power` is at least `log2(n)`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `power` equals `n`. If so, it prints \(2^n\).
   - Otherwise, it decrements `power` by 1 and prints \(2^{power}\).

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Largest Divisor**:
   - The program does not actually implement the swap operation as described in the problem statement. Instead, it attempts to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and prints a result based on that.
   - This approach does not correctly simulate the swap operations described.

2. **Logic for Finding Position of 1**:
   - The logic for finding the position of 1 after all swaps is flawed. The program does not perform the actual swaps but rather tries to infer the final position based on powers of 2, which is not accurate.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement to see why the program is incorrect:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`
  - Output: `1` (correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`
  - Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - After `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4]`
  - After `swap(3)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4] -> [2, 1, 4, 3]`
  - After `swap(4)`: `[2, 1, 4, 3] -> [2, 4, 3, 1]`
  - Final array: `[2, 4, 3, 1]`
  - Position of 1: `4` (correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`
  - Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - After `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`
  - After `swap(3)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5] -> [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`
  - After `swap(4)`: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5] -> [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`
  - After `swap(5)`: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5] -> [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`
  - Final array: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`
  - Position of 1: `2` (incorrect, should be `2`)

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 120240229`
  - The program incorrectly prints `2^27 = 134217728` (incorrect)

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the swap operations as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
