Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n_cases)`.
   - The variable `i` is being initialized and incremented within the loop.
   - The variable `n_cases` is used as the upper bound for the range function.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n_cases`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `n_cases` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts from 0).
   - The value of `i` is not specified initially, but it will start from 0 and increment with each iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n_cases` and `i`. Specifically, `n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be set to 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
