You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It sorts these integers, calculates a value `ans` based on specific conditions, and adjusts `ans` using a temporary list `tmp`. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `ans` and `n-2` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of `x` chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This accounts for the triangles formed by the initial `x` chosen vertices plus the additional `y` vertices.
   - It checks for consecutive pairs of vertices with a gap of 2 (indicating a potential triangle). If found, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - It also checks the gap between the first and last chosen vertices, adding to `ans` if the gap is 2 or even.

3. **Handling Gaps:**
   - The gaps between the chosen vertices are stored in the list `tmp`.
   - These gaps are sorted and iteratively checked to see if they can contribute additional triangles.
   - For each gap `i` in `tmp`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, it adds `i` to `ans` and reduces `y` by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is insufficient, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - Finally, it adds any remaining `y` to `ans`.
   - The result is capped at `n - 2` to ensure it doesn't exceed the total number of possible triangles in an `n`-sided polygon.

### Analysis:

- **Initial Triangle Count:** 
  - The initial calculation `x + y - 2` correctly accounts for the basic triangles formed by the initial `x` vertices plus the additional `y` vertices.
- **Handling Consecutive Pairs:**
  - Checking for gaps of 2 and even gaps ensures that potential triangles are identified.
- **Gaps Handling:**
  - Sorting and iterating through the gaps allows the program to maximize the number of triangles by leveraging the available `y` vertices.
- **Final Adjustment:**
  - Adding the remaining `y` vertices and capping at `n - 2` ensures the result is valid.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
