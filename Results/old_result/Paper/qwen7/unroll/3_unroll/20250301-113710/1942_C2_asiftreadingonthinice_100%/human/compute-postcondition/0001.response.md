Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ii` and `tt`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `tt` is an integer input from the user.
   - `ii` is the loop counter that starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `tt` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `tt-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `tt` is determined by user input, we need to ensure that `tt` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `ii` is 0, as the loop starts with `ii = 0`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `tt` (it must be greater than 0) and `ii` (it is 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
