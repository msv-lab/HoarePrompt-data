Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), where the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, it calculates a sum and a value `r`, then prints the sum and `n + r`. It also prints a sequence of lines where the first line contains numbers from 1 to `n`, and subsequent lines alternate between printing numbers from 1 to `n` and repeating the first number based on the modulo operation with `n`. This process repeats `t` times.**
