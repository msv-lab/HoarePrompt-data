Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the list `a` without duplicates, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.
