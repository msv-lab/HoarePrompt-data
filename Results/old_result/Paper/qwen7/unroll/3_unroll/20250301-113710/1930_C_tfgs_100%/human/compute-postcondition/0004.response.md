Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, and the list a is a list of integers where each element a[i] is increased by (i + 1) for every iteration i in the range of n.

In more detail: After the loop executes all the iterations, each element a[i] in the list a will be incremented by (i + 1), where i ranges from 0 to n-1.
