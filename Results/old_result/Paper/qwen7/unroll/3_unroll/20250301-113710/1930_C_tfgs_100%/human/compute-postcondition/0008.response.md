Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the list `a` without duplicates, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `cur` is 0; the list `a` is sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `counter`, `t`, `n`, or `cur`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is that the list `a` is now sorted in descending order.
