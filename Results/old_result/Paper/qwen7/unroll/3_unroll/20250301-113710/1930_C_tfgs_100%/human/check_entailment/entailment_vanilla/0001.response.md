Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the required logic.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It increments each element `a[i]` by `i + 1`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each value in the modified array.
   - It converts the array to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
   - It calculates the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array to determine how many times to repeat each element in the final result.

3. **Constructing the Result Array `b`:**
   - It iterates through the sorted array and constructs the result array `ans` by repeating each element according to the calculated differences.
   - It ensures that the total number of elements in `ans` matches the size of the set `a`.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If there are remaining elements to add to the result array, it appends the last element of `ans` decremented by 1 for each remaining element.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The incrementation of each element by its index plus one is correctly implemented.

2. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - Converting the array to a set to remove duplicates is correct.

3. **Sorting and Constructing `b`:**
   - Sorting the array in descending order is correct.
   - The logic for constructing the result array `ans` by repeating each element based on the difference between consecutive elements is correct.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The logic for appending the last element decremented by 1 for each remaining element is correct.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the necessary steps to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` as required.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
