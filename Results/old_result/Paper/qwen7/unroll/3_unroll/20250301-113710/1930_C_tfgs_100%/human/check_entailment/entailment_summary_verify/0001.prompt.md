You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It first increments each element in the list by its index plus one. Then, it creates a list `ans` by sorting the unique elements of the modified list in descending order, filling in gaps between consecutive elements based on certain conditions, and appending `cnt` consecutive decreasing elements to the end of `ans`. Finally, it prints the resulting list `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the required logic.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It increments each element `a[i]` by `i + 1`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each value in the modified array.
   - It converts the array to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
   - It calculates the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array to determine how many times to repeat each element in the final result.

3. **Constructing the Result Array `b`:**
   - It iterates through the sorted array and constructs the result array `ans` by repeating each element according to the calculated differences.
   - It ensures that the total number of elements in `ans` matches the size of the set `a`.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If there are remaining elements to add to the result array, it appends the last element of `ans` decremented by 1 for each remaining element.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The incrementation of each element by its index plus one is correctly implemented.

2. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - Converting the array to a set to remove duplicates is correct.

3. **Sorting and Constructing `b`:**
   - Sorting the array in descending order is correct.
   - The logic for constructing the result array `ans` by repeating each element based on the difference between consecutive elements is correct.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The logic for appending the last element decremented by 1 for each remaining element is correct.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the necessary steps to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` as required.

Correctness: **True**
