Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the list `a` without duplicates, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `cur` is 0.**

The code `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicate elements from the list `a` and assigns it to `a`. The `counter` variable remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `cur` remains 0.
