You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, and the list a is a list of integers where each element a[i] is increased by (i + 1) for every iteration i in the range of n.
    #
    #In more detail: After the loop executes all the iterations, each element a[i] in the list a will be incremented by (i + 1), where i ranges from 0 to n-1.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `ans` is a list containing elements from `a` with gaps filled based on the differences between consecutive elements and the value of `cnt` and `cur`. `counter` is updated to reflect the remaining counts of each element in `a`. `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `cur` are unchanged.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is a list containing `cnt` consecutive elements where each element is 1 less than the previous element (starting from the last element of the initial `ans`). `counter` is updated to reflect the remaining counts of each element in `a`. `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `cur` are unchanged.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 3 2 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of inputs. Each group includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each group, the function processes the list of integers and returns a result based on the specified conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
