Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` (an underscore), which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the index itself is not needed.
   - There are no other variables directly involved in the loop head.

2. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `cnt` iterations, as specified by `range(cnt)`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop runs for `cnt` iterations, the variable `cnt` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at all.
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

4. **Consider the Given Program State:**
   - `ans` is a list containing elements from `a` with gaps filled based on the differences between consecutive elements and the value of `cnt` and `cur`.
   - `counter` is updated to reflect the remaining counts of each element in `a`.
   - `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `cur` are unchanged.

5. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `cnt` being greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0**
