Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**: The function `func_1(n, k)` aims to generate a sequence of `n` integers such that their sum equals `k` and the bitwise OR of the sequence maximizes the number of 1s in its binary representation. The logic in the function is flawed because it sets each element of the list `nums` to `k-1` regardless of the actual value of `k`. This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Bitwise OR Maximization**: To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence, the optimal strategy is to use numbers that contribute the highest possible number of 1s in their binary representation while ensuring their sum equals `k`. The correct approach would involve using powers of 2 to fill up the sum `k` and adjust the last element accordingly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Use the largest powers of 2 that fit into `k` to fill the sequence.
   - Subtract the used values from `k` and adjust the last element to ensure the sum is `k`.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the correct output should be `[3, 0]` because `3 | 0 = 3` (binary `11`), which maximizes the number of 1s.
   - For `n=2` and `k=5`, the correct output should be `[4, 1]` because `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`), which maximizes the number of 1s.

5. **Current Function Output**:
   - If `k` is a small number, the current function will produce a list where each element is `k-1`, which does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

Conclusion:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as it does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
