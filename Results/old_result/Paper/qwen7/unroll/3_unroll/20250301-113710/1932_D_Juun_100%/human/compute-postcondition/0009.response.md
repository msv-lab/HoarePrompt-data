Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input string from `input()`, `answers` is a list containing strings where each string represents a pair of ranks and suits that were compared, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None. The loop iterates over each suit in `suits`. If the rank for a suit is not None and `trumps` is not an empty list, it appends a formatted string to `answers` by popping an element from `trumps`. If the rank for a suit is not None but `trumps` is an empty list, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns, thus breaking out of the loop.
