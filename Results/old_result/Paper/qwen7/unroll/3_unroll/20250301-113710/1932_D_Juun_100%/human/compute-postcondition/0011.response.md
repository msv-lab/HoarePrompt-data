Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted list of its original elements in descending order, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit remains the input string from `input()`, `answers` is a list containing strings where each string represents a pair of ranks and suits that were compared, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None.**

Explanation: The code `trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)` sorts the list `trumps` in descending order. All other variables (`t`, `n`, the trump suit, `answers`, and `suits`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
