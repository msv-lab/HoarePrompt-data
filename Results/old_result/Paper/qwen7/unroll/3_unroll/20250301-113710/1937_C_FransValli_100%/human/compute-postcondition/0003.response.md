Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It aims to find two indices i and j in a secret permutation p such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The permutation p is a sequence of unique integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer within the range 2 to 10^4. The function returns the indices i and j that achieve the maximum XOR value.**
