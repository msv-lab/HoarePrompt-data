The function finds two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in a secret permutation \(p\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. It first identifies an index \(maxi\) with a high value, then determines an index \(mini\) with a low value among those compared to \(maxi\). Finally, it outputs these two indices \(maxi\) and \(mini\).
