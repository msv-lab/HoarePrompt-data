Output State: The output state is the result of finding two indices \( i \) and \( j \) in a secret permutation \( p \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most 3n queries. After executing the loop, the values of \( maxi \) and \( mini \) are printed as the result, where \( maxi \) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation and \( mini \) is the index of the minimum value in the permutation found through the comparison process described in the loop.
