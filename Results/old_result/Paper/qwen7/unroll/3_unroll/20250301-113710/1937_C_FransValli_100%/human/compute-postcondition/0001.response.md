Output State: The output state will consist of two indices, `maxi` and `mini`, which are determined by the process described in the loop. Specifically, `maxi` is the index that maximizes the bitwise XOR with any other index, and `mini` is the index among those that give the same result as `maxi` when XORed with `maxi`. The exact values of `maxi` and `mini` depend on the secret permutation `p`, but they are chosen to satisfy the conditions specified in the loop.
