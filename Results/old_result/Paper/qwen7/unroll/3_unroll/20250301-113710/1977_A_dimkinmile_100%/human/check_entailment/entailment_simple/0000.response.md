Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. It checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
4. If the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is satisfied, it prints "Yes".
5. Otherwise, it prints "No".

Given the problem statement and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative for the result to be "Yes". This matches the requirements of the problem perfectly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
