### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and then iterates over each test case using a loop.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. This function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
3. **Logic for Determining Validity**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Let's analyze the logic:
- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes must remain consistent with the parity of the number of moves.
- **Condition `n - m >= 0`**: This condition ensures that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which makes sense because you cannot have more cubes removed than added.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic. Let's consider the following scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: `n = 3` and `m = 3`
  - `(n - m) = 0`, which is even, and `0 >= 0`. So, the program prints 'Yes'.
  - This is correct because adding 3 cubes is possible in 3 moves.

- **Scenario 2**: `n = 2` and `m = 4`
  - `(n - m) = -2`, which is not even, and `-2 < 0`. So, the program prints 'No'.
  - This is correct because removing 2 cubes and adding 4 cubes is not possible in 2 moves.

- **Scenario 3**: `n = 5` and `m = 3`
  - `(n - m) = 2`, which is even, and `2 >= 0`. So, the program prints 'Yes'.
  - This is correct because adding 3 cubes and removing 2 cubes is possible in 5 moves.

- **Scenario 4**: `n = 4` and `m = 6`
  - `(n - m) = -2`, which is not even, and `-2 < 0`. So, the program prints 'No'.
  - This is incorrect because removing 2 cubes and adding 6 cubes is possible in 4 moves. The correct logic should check if the absolute value of `(n - m)` is even and less than or equal to `n`.

The current logic only checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, but it should also ensure that the absolute value of `(n - m)` is even and less than or equal to `n`.

### Corrected Logic:
```python
if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0 and abs(n - m) <= n:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the current logic does not account for the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m`. The corrected logic should use `abs(n - m)` to ensure the absolute value is even and within the bounds of `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the missing consideration of the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m`.
