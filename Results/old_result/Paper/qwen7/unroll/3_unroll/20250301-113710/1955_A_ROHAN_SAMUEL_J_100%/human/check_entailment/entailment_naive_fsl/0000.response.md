Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where buying in pairs (at the promotion price) is more advantageous even when `n` is even. 

Consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to buy all four yogurts at the promotion price since `2 * a (10) < b (11)`. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a`, which results in `2 * 11 + 5 = 27` instead of `4 * 5 = 20`.

To fix this, the program should check the condition `2 * a < b` before deciding whether to buy in pairs or individually. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)

func()
```

This version ensures that the program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and chooses the minimum cost strategy.
