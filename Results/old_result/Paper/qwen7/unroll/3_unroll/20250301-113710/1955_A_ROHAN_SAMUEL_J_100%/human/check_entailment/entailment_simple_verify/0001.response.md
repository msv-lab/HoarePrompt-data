### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the annotated code and the provided example inputs.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd (`n % 2`).
     - If `n` is odd, it further checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buying the remaining yogurt individually).
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all pairs at the promotional price).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic handles both odd and even values of `n` correctly.
   - It also correctly compares the costs between individual prices and promotional prices.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification with Example Input:

Let's verify the logic with the provided example input:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `2 5 9`
- Calculation:
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
  - Therefore, use the promotional price: `2 // 2 * 9 = 9`
- Output: `9` (Correct)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `3 5 9`
- Calculation:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
  - Therefore, use the individual price: `3 * 5 = 15`
- Output: `15` (Incorrect, should be `14`)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `3 5 11`
- Calculation:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
  - Therefore, use the promotional price for two and individual price for one: `1 * 5 + 1 * 11 / 2 = 15`
- Output: `15` (Correct)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `4 5 11`
- Calculation:
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
  - Therefore, use the promotional price: `4 // 2 * 11 = 22`
- Output: `22` (Incorrect, should be `20`)

Upon closer inspection, we see that the program is not handling the case where `n` is odd and `2 * a < b` correctly. Specifically, it should calculate the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` instead of just `n // 2 * b`.

### Corrected Logic:
For the odd `n` case where `2 * a < b`, the correct calculation should be:
```python
if n % 2:
    if 2 * a < b:
        print(n // 2 * b + a)
    else:
        print(a * n)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`. The corrected logic should be applied to ensure the minimum cost is calculated accurately.

**Final: False**
