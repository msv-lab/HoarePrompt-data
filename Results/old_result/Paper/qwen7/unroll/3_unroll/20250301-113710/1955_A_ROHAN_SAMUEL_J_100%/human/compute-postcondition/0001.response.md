Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case. For each test case, if `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, it will print `a * n`; otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even and `2 * a < b`, it will print `a * n`; otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b`. The number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases provided as input.
