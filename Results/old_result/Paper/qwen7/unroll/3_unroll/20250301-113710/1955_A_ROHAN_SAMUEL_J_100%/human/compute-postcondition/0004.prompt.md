You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each corresponding to the output of one test case. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it will print either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b + a`, depending on whether `2 * a < b` holds true. If `n` is even, it will print either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b`, again depending on whether `2 * a < b` holds true. The exact values printed will depend on the specific inputs provided for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers t, n, and a, and a, b within the specified ranges. It returns a result based on the value of t, where if t is 1, it returns a string indicating the relationship between n and a (e.g., "n is greater than a"), and if t is 2, it returns a string indicating the relationship between n and b (e.g., "n is less than b"). If t is outside the range [1, 10^4], it returns an error message.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
