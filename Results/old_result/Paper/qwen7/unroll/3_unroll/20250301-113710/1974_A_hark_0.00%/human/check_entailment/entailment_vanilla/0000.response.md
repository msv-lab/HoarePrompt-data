Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used in the main logic of the program, so we can ignore it for now.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes input values `x` and `y`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is complex and involves several calculations:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates how many 2x2 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing the maximum possible 2x2 icons.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the count of 1x1 icons based on the placement of 2x2 icons.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using `func_2`.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them.

### Detailed Analysis of Logic

- **Case 1**: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
  - The calculation `math.ceil(y / 2)` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen.
  - The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` ensures that the remaining 1x1 icons are recalculated after placing the 2x2 icons.
  - The final calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is correct for determining the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

- **Case 2**: Only `y` is greater than 0.
  - The logic `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

- **Case 3**: Only `x` is greater than 0.
  - The logic `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` is correct because each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

- **Case 4**: Both `x` and `y` are 0.
  - The logic `print(0)` is correct because no icons need to be placed.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic, it appears that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for different combinations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The calculations and conditions are handled appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
