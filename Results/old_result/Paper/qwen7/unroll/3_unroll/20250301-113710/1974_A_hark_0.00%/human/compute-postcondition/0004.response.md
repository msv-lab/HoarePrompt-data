Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, x and y are integers between 0 and 99 inclusive. The function does not return any specific value but seems to process these test cases based on given constraints.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not include the logic for processing the test cases, only the constraints. Therefore, the description focuses on the input constraints rather than the return value, as the return value is not specified in the given information.
