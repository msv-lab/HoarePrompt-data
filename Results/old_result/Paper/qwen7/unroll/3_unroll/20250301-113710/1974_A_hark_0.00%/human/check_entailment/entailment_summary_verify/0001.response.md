### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to place icons on a grid where each screen is 5x3 (15 cells).
- Icons can be either 1x1 or 2x2 (4 cells).
- We need to minimize the number of screens required.

#### Function Summaries Recap
- `func_1` is unused and irrelevant to our analysis.
- `func_2` processes a single test case and calculates the minimum number of screens needed.
- `func_3` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_2` for each.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`

1. **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` correctly calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit.
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the count of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` correctly calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The final result is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

2. **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0**
   - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

3. **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0**
   - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` is correct because each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

4. **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**
   - `print(0)` is correct because no icons need to be placed.

#### Potential Issues

1. **Adjustment Calculation**:
   - The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` seems incorrect. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4 + y * 4` since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 15.

2. **Screen Calculation**:
   - The final screen calculation should consider the total number of cells occupied by both types of icons and divide by 15.

#### Corrected Logic

Here is the corrected logic for `func_2`:

```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 4 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)
```

#### Final Evaluation

Given the corrected logic, the original assessment was inaccurate due to the incorrect adjustment calculation in the `func_2` function. However, the overall structure and handling of different cases were mostly correct.

**Final: False**
