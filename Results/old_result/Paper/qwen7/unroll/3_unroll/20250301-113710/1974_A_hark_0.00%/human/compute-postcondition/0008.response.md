Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `y` is a non-negative integer greater than 0. This means `y` can be any positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet is `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`.

3. **Explanation**:
   - `math.ceil(y / 2)` will take the value of `y`, divide it by 2, and then round up to the nearest integer if the result is not already an integer.
   - Since `y` is a positive integer, dividing it by 2 and then applying `math.ceil` will result in either `y // 2` (if `y` is even) or `y // 2 + 1` (if `y` is odd).

4. **Output**:
   - The exact output depends on the specific value of `y`, but it will always be an integer.

Given the above steps, the output will be the ceiling value of `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0)**
