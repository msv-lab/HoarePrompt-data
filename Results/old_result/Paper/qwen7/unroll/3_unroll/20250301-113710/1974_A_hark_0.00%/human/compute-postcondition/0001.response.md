Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input from the user.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop will execute if and only if `t` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The initial value of `t` is determined by the user input, but we need to make sure it meets the condition for the loop to execute.

5. **Final State**: Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
