Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. According to the problem description, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is given by the formula \( \text{gcd}(a, b) + 1 \), where gcd is the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\). However, the program incorrectly calculates the result using the formula \( \frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2 \).

To illustrate, let's consider the first test case: \(a = 6\), \(b = 7\), and \(m = 4\).

- The correct approach would be to find the gcd of 6 and 7, which is 1. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(1 + 1 = 2\).
- However, the program calculates \( \frac{4}{6} + \frac{4}{7} + 2 \approx 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 \), which seems correct in this specific case but fails in other scenarios.

Let's consider another test case: \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), and \(m = 10\).

- The correct approach would be to find the gcd of 3 and 4, which is 1. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(1 + 1 = 2\).
- However, the program calculates \( \frac{10}{3} + \frac{10}{4} + 2 \approx 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 \), which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, making it incorrect.
