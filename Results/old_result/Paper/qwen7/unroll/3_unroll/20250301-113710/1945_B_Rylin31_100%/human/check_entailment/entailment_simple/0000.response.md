Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula used in the program is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula is derived from the principle that the number of fireworks from the first installation that can be seen at any given time is `m // a`, and the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be seen at the same time is `m // b`. Adding these together gives the total number of fireworks from both installations that can be seen at the same time, plus 2 to account for the possibility of fireworks being launched at the exact same time from both installations.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Specifically, the term `+ 2` is unnecessary and incorrect because it overcounts the scenario where fireworks from both installations are launched at the same time. The correct approach should be to use the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the time intervals when fireworks from both installations coincide, but the given solution does not implement this correctly.

Given the problem statement and the example outputs, the correct formula should be `math.gcd(a, b) + m // lcm(a, b)`, where `lcm(a, b)` is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`, and `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

Since the provided solution does not correctly implement this logic, it will not produce the correct results for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
