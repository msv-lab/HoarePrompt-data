Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where Anna and Sasha take turns modifying a list of integers. Anna reverses the digits of chosen elements, and Sasha concatenates two elements. The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, and the winner is determined based on whether the remaining number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the length of the list (`list_len`) and the parameter `max_power`.
   - It reads the list of integers and reverses each integer.
   - It sorts the reversed integers.
   - It constructs a new string by alternating between non-same-length and same-length reversed integers.
   - It compares \(10^{max_power}\) with the constructed string and prints 'Sasha' if the string is greater, otherwise it prints 'Anna'.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program correctly handles the reversal of digits.
   - The sorting and construction of the new string follow the rules of the game.
   - The comparison with \(10^{max_power}\) is done correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles different lengths of reversed integers correctly.
   - The alternation logic ensures that the constructed string respects the game rules.
   - The comparison logic is straightforward and accurate.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program logic aligns with the problem statement and execution summary.
   - There are no logical errors or omissions in the program.

Correctness: **True**
