Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for y in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `y`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `y`**: The loop will start with `y` being 0 because `range(int(input()))` generates a sequence starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input will always be a positive integer.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `y` starts from 0 and that the input value is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`y` is 0, and the input must be greater than 0**
