Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program instead calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the maximum possible beauty.

To achieve the maximum beauty, the elements should be arranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The given solution does not consider this arrangement and thus fails to provide the correct result for many cases. For example, in the input:

```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

The correct maximum beauty would be achieved by arranging the array as `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, resulting in a beauty of `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`. However, the program outputs `57 - 43 = 14`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is hence incorrect.
