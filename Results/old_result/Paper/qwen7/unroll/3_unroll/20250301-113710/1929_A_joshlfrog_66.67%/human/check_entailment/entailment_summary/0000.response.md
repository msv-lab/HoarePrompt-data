Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to find the maximum difference between the largest and smallest numbers in each test case's array. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The problem requires maximizing the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). 

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Sorting ensures that the largest elements are paired with the smallest ones, maximizing each individual difference.

Given the execution summary, the program only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. This will not yield the correct result because it does not account for the arrangement of elements to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
