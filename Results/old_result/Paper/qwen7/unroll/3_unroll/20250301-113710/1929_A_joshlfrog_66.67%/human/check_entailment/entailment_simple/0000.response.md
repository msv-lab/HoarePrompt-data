Reasoning:
The given program attempts to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty. The program instead calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This ensures that the differences are maximized.

Here's why the current program is incorrect:

1. The program initializes `x` to 100000000 and `y` to 100000000. These values are then updated to the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively. This only gives the range of the array but does not account for the arrangement of elements to maximize the beauty.

2. The program prints `x - y` after processing each test case, which is simply the range of the array, not the maximum beauty.

Given the correct approach, the program should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])
        
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, l):
            beauty += nums[i] - nums[i-1]
        
        print(beauty)
```

Since the provided program does not implement the correct logic, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
