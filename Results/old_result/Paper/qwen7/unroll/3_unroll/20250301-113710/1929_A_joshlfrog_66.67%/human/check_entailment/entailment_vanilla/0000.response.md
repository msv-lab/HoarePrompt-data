Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
- To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.
- The best strategy would be to sort the array and then calculate the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This ensures that the largest possible positive differences are used.

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `l` is read as the length of the array.
   - The array `nums` is read and split into individual integers.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Variables `x` and `y` are initialized. 
     - `x` is set to 0, which will store the maximum value in the array.
     - `y` is set to a large value (100000000), which will store the minimum value in the array.

3. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - A loop iterates through the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values.
   - This approach only finds the maximum and minimum values but does not sort the array.

4. **Output:**
   - The difference `x - y` is printed, which represents the maximum possible difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference.
- This approach does not ensure that the array is sorted or that the maximum beauty is achieved.
- For example, consider the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. Sorting the array gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the maximum beauty is calculated as `(100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 43) = 57`.
- However, the program calculates `100 - 43 = 57`, which is not the full beauty since it misses the positive differences between other pairs.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it only finds the maximum and minimum values without ensuring the maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array.

**Correctness: False**
