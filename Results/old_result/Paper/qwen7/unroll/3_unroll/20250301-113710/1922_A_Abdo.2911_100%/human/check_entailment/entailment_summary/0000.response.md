Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. The goal is to determine if there exists a template such that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Reading String Length and Strings**: It reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Checking Conditions**: For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` for the strings `a` and `b` to match the template and `c` to not match.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, `c[i]` can be either `a[i]` or `b[i]` without violating the conditions.
4. **Setting `possible` Flag**: The flag `possible` is set to `True` if `c[i]` violates the condition with respect to `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `possible` remains `False` after checking all positions, it means no such template exists.
5. **Printing Result**: Based on the value of `possible`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic in the program aligns with the requirements. The program correctly identifies whether a template exists that satisfies the conditions for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
