### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \(\text{? } a \ b \ c \ d\) to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - After finding the indices, we need to print \(\text{! } i \ j\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `mak` to 0 and iterates from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - It prints a query to compare \((p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak}})\) and \((p_i \mid p_i)\), and updates `mak` if the result is `<`.
   - This process ensures that `mak` is set to the index with the highest single-bit OR value.
   - Then, it initializes `mak2` to `mak` and iterates through all indices to find those with the same OR value as `mak`.
   - It prints a series of queries to identify the index with the highest OR value among the candidates.
   - Finally, it prints the answer.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the initial `mak` seems correct. It ensures that `mak` is the index with the highest single-bit OR value.
   - The logic for finding the final answer (`mak2` and `mak`) also seems correct. It ensures that the final answer is the pair with the highest XOR value.

4. **Query Count:**
   - The code makes \(2n + 1\) queries in the worst case (one for each index to find the initial `mak`, and then one for each candidate to find the final answer).
   - Since \(2n + 1 \leq 3n\) for \(n \geq 2\), the query limit is respected.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where the permutation is trivial (e.g., \([0, 1]\) or \([1, 0]\)) correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within the allowed query limit.

### Correctness:
**True**
