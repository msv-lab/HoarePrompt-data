Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space, representing the final values of `mak2` and `mak` after all iterations of the loop have completed. These values are determined by the comparisons made within the loop and represent the indices of elements in the permutation that satisfy certain conditions.

In more detail, `mak2` is set to the value of `mak` at the end of the first part of the loop, and `mak` is updated through a series of comparisons and assignments based on user inputs indicating the relative order of elements. The final values of `mak2` and `mak` reflect the result of these comparisons across all test cases and permutations.
