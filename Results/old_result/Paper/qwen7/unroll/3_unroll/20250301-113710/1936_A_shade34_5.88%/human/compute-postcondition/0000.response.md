Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop to iterate over the range of input values.

2. **Determine the Input Source**: The loop iterates based on the input provided by the user. Specifically, it reads an integer from the input using `int(input())`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `int(input())` provides a valid integer value. The loop will stop when the input is no longer a valid integer or the input stream ends.

4. **Initial State Before the Loop**: According to the problem description:
   - `t` (the number of test cases) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - For each test case, `n` (the size of the permutation) is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - The permutation \(p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\) is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\).

5. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop depends on the input from the user, the initial state before the loop should reflect the conditions under which the loop will execute. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as there are valid test cases to process.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the condition that ensures the loop will continue to execute. This means the loop will continue as long as there are more test cases to process.

**State:**
- `t` (number of test cases) must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
