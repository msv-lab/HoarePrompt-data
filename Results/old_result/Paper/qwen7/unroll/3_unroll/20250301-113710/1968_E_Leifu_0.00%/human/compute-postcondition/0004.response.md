Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two values, t and n, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^3. It does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over t test cases, each involving an integer n, but since no specific return value is mentioned, it implies the function might perform some operations or validations on t and n without returning anything directly.
