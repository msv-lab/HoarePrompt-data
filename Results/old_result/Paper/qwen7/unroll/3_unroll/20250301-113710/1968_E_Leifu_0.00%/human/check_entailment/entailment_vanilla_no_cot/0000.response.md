Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program only works for \(n = 3\) and \(n = 4\) based on the hardcoded values. For other values of \(n\), the Manhattan distances do not cover the maximum possible set of unique values.

To illustrate, let's consider \(n = 5\) and \(n = 6\):

- For \(n = 5\), the program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  2 4
  4 4
  5 5
  ```

  This does not maximize \(\mathcal{H}\). A better arrangement would be:
  ```
  1 1
  1 3
  4 3
  4 4
  5 5
  ```

- For \(n = 6\), the program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  2 4
  4 4
  5 5
  6 1
  ```

  Again, this does not maximize \(\mathcal{H}\). A better arrangement would be:
  ```
  1 4
  1 5
  1 6
  5 2
  5 5
  6 1
  ```

The program needs to be revised to generate a configuration that maximizes the set of unique Manhattan distances for any \(n\).
