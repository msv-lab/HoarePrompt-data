Output State: The value of `t` is printed as the number of times the outer loop runs. For each `i` in the range of `t`, the following outputs are produced:
- '1 1'
- '1 2'
- If `n` (input for the current iteration) is 3, then '2 3' is printed.
- Otherwise, '2 4' is printed, followed by lines from '4' to `n` (inclusive), each printed as 'j j', where `j` ranges from 4 to `n`.
