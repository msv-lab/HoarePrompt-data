Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to place `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which will always be part of the solution.
   - If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `(2, 3)`. This is a valid configuration for `n=3` as it maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(1, 4)` and `(2, 4)`, and then for each subsequent row from 4 to `n`, it prints `(j, j)`.
   
3. **Verification**:
   - For `n=2`: The solution prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, resulting in Manhattan distances `{0, 1}`. This is correct.
   - For `n=3`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`, resulting in Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3}`. This is correct.
   - For `n=4`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(4, 4)`, `(3, 3)`, `(5, 5)`, etc., which results in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances. This is correct.
   - For `n=5`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, etc., which is a valid configuration.
   - For `n=6`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(6, 6)`, etc., which is also a valid configuration.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all tested values of `n`.

Correctness: **True**
