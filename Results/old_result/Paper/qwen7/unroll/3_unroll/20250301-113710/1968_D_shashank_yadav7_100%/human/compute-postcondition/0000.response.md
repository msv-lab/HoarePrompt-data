Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and we are ready to read more inputs for n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input for `t`. The initial conditions for `t` (that it is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) remain valid, but the specific value of `t` is now known and stored in the variable. The program is now expecting further inputs for `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`.
