Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issue lies in how the `defaultdict` is being used and initialized. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of `defaultdict`:**
   - The code initializes `d` using `defaultdict(default_value)`, but `default_value` is not defined anywhere in the code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Problems Needed:**
   - The logic to calculate the minimum number of problems needed is flawed. It assumes that the count of each difficulty level in the dictionary `d` should be compared against `m` directly, which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach would be to check how many of each difficulty level are missing to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.

3. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The program processes each test case within the while loop, which is fine, but the way it calculates the answer is incorrect.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic and does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is irrelevant to the problem at hand.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
