Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya fit the settling pattern described.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program iterates over \( t \) test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the possible values of \( k \) using two conditions:
     - When \( n + x - 2 \) is even.
     - When \( n - x \) is even.
   - It uses a helper function `func_1` to get all divisors of the calculated value.
   - It checks if each divisor satisfies the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the list of possible \( k \) values.

3. **Checking the Helper Function**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It splits the divisors into two lists and ensures they are returned in the correct order.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic in the main part of the program is correct for finding the possible values of \( k \).
   - The conditions used to filter the divisors are also correct based on the problem statement.

Given the execution summary and the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
