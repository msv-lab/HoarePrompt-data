Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `output2` as an empty list. Since `x` and `n` are unchanged and `output1` was already an empty list, their states remain the same. Therefore, `output2` becomes a new empty list, while `x`, `n`, and `output1` retain their initial states.
