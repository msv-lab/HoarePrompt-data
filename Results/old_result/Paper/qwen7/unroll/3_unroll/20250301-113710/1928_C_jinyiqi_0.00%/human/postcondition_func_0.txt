The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x` (including `x` itself). The divisors are first collected in two separate lists: `output1` for those less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` for their corresponding quotient divisors. After reversing `output1`, the function concatenates and returns `output2` followed by `output1`.
