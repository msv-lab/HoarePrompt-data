Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( x \) and number \( x \) can be obtained following the "first-k-th" position rule. The rule dictates that the sequence repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The sequence repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - The position \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions to fit within the repeating pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of a number, which helps in determining the possible values of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly finds all divisors of \( x \).
   - It returns these divisors in a specific order, ensuring all divisors are included.

4. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program correctly checks two conditions:
     1. When \( (n + x - 2) \) is even.
     2. When \( (n - x) \) is even.
   - For each condition, it uses `func_1` to find divisors and filters them based on the condition that \( \frac{s+2}{2} \geq x \).
   - The results are stored in a set to ensure uniqueness before returning the count.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) are handled correctly.
   - The logic for filtering divisors ensures that only valid \( k \) values are considered.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
