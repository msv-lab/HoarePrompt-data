The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n`, an integer `q`, an array `a` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `x` and `y`. For each query, the function checks whether the subarray of `a` from index `x-1` to `y-1` meets the condition `a[y] - a[x-1] >= b[y] - b[x-1]` and `x != y`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
