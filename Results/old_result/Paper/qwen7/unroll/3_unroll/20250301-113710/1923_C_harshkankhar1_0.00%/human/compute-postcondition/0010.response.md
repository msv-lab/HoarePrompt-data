Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list `a`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 1`, then `x = 1`, otherwise `x = 2`), starting from `b[0] = 0`, the loop iterates `q` times, each time reading two integers `x` and `y` from input, and printing 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise printing 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the loop executes all iterations.
