Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `t` and `n`, followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers. It then generates a string `ans` by iterating through the list, converting each index value to a corresponding character in the alphabet (starting from 'a'), and increments the value at that index by 1 after each use. Finally, it prints the generated string `ans` for each test case.**
