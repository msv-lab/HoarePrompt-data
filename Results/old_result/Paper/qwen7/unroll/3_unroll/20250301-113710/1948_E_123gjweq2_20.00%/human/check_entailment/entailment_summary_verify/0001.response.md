### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to confirm the correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)`, which is a heuristic approach but not necessarily optimal.
   - It initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It calls the `make_array` function to fill these arrays.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It divides the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns elements sequentially.
   - However, this division does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)` within the same clique.

### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Number of Cliques**:
   - The calculation `ceil(n / k)` is a heuristic and might not always yield the minimum number of cliques. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, `ceil(5 / 3) = 2`, but a better solution could be 3 cliques. This heuristic might not always be optimal.

2. **Filling the Array**:
   - The `make_array` function divides the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns elements sequentially. This approach does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)` within the same clique. For instance, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the current implementation might assign `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to the array, which does not satisfy the condition for all pairs.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the array `arr` directly without ensuring that the assigned values satisfy the condition for forming cliques.
   - The output format does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed evaluation, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated because it does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)` within the same clique. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
