Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices of a graph such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The key condition for adding an edge between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) is \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
     - This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.
     - The function calls `make_array` for each clique index from `0` to `cliques - 1`.
     - `make_array` fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in a specific pattern to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
     - The `arr` array is filled with the value `1` repeated `n` times, and the `cliquess` array is filled with the corresponding clique identifiers.
   - **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - This function fills a portion of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the given range `[left, right]` and the current clique identifier.
     - It ensures that the elements in `arr` are assigned values in a symmetric manner around the midpoint of the range, and the corresponding elements in `cliquess` are set to the clique identifier.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The `make_array` function correctly fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays to satisfy the conditions of the problem.
   - The output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
