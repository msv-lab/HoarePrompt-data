Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `n` and `k` as input.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of size `n` with zeros.
   - The main logic is in the loop where it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on `left` and `right`.
   - It then divides the range `[left, right]` into two parts and fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cliques**:
   - The calculation of the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)` might not always result in the minimum possible number of cliques. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, `ceil(5 / 3) = 2`, but a better solution could be 3 cliques.

2. **Filling the Array**:
   - The `make_array` function does not correctly handle the assignment of elements to ensure the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)` within the same clique.
   - The current implementation simply divides the range `[left, right]` into two halves and assigns elements sequentially, which may not satisfy the condition for all pairs.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the array `arr` directly without ensuring that the assigned values satisfy the condition for forming cliques.
   - The output format does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
