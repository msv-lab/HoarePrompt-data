The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` within specified ranges, calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n` divided by `k`, and uses the `make_array` function to fill an array `arr` with the value `1` repeated `n` times. It then prints the filled array, the calculated number of cliques, and an array of `n` zeros.
