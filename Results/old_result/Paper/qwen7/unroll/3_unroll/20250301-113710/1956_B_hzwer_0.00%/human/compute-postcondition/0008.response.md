Output State: **dp[0][0], which is the maximum value obtained by the given logic, considering the constraints and operations within the loop.**

This means that the program returns the value stored in `dp[0][0]`, which represents the maximum value achieved through the specified logic, constraints, and operations within the loop as defined in the initial state.
