The function calculates and returns the maximum value obtained by a given logic involving dynamic programming. This logic iterates over a list of integers, considering specific constraints on the values of `t` and `n`. The function does not accept any parameters directly but uses input values for `n` and a list of integers `cards`. It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` to find the maximum value based on the count of each integer in the list and updates this table in reverse order. The final result, stored in `dp[0][0]`, represents the maximum value achievable under the given conditions.
