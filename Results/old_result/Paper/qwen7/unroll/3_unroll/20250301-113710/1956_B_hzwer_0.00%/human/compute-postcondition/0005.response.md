Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i`, which is initialized to `n - 3` and decremented by 1 until it reaches -1.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 3`.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `i` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `dp[n - 1][0]` is set to 0
- `dp[n - 2][0]` is set to 0
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `cards` is a list containing integers from the input split by spaces, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is `n - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 0**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `n - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 0**
