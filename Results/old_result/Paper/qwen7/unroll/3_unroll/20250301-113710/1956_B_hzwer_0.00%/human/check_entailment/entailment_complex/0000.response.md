Reasoning:
1. The problem involves calculating the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against an opponent who also plays optimally.
2. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the solution using dynamic programming.
3. The function `func_1()` correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem:
   - It initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points you can get when you have `i` cards left and `j` points.
   - It iterates over the cards in reverse order, updating the DP table based on whether the current card has been seen once or twice.
   - The base cases are correctly set up for the last two cards.
   - The function returns `dp[0][0]`, which is the maximum points you can achieve starting with all `n` cards and 0 points.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the function `func_1()` correctly computes the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

Correctness: **True**
