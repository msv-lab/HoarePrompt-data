Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, but the logic within the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically, the way the dynamic programming table (`dp`) is filled does not correctly simulate the game's rules and Nene's optimal strategy.

Here’s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Initialization**: The initial values for `dp` should consider the starting state where no cards are placed yet, and the first two turns are handled separately.
2. **Incorrect Transition Logic**: The transitions in the DP table do not accurately reflect the game's rules. For instance, when a card is placed on the table, Nene will try to maximize her score, which means she would place a card that hasn't been seen yet if possible. This is not correctly handled in the current implementation.
3. **Counting Cards**: The `cards.count(j + 1)` approach is inefficient and does not correctly simulate the game's state changes.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the game properly, considering Nene's optimal strategy. Here’s a corrected approach:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count occurrences of each card
    card_count = [0] * (n + 1)
    for card in cards:
        card_count[card] += 1
    
    # Sort cards to facilitate optimal play
    sorted_cards = sorted(cards)
    
    points = 0
    for i in range(n):
        # Nene will play optimally to minimize your score
        if card_count[sorted_cards[i]] == 2:
            # Nene will place a card that hasn't been seen yet if possible
            if card_count[sorted_cards[i]] == 2 and card_count[sorted_cards[i] + 1] > 0:
                card_count[sorted_cards[i] + 1] -= 1
            else:
                card_count[sorted_cards[i]] -= 1
        else:
            # You can play any card
            points += 1
            card_count[sorted_cards[i]] -= 1
    
    return points

for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

This corrected version simulates the game more accurately by ensuring that Nene plays optimally to minimize your score while you play to maximize your score.
