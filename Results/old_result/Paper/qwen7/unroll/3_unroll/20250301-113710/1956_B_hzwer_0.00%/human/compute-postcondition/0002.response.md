Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the list `cards` contains integers from the input split by spaces, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), where each element is initialized to 0.**

The code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is set to 0. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `cards` also remains unchanged.
