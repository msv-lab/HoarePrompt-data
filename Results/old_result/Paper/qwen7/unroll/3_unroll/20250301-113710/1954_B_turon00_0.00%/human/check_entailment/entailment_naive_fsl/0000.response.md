Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program checks if all elements are the same and prints `-1` if they are, but it does not correctly handle cases where removing elements is necessary.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program should output `1` because removing the second element (which is `2`) will make the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, and it is no longer beautiful. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly and will likely output an incorrect result.
