Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. If all elements in the list `a` are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number in the list `a`.**
