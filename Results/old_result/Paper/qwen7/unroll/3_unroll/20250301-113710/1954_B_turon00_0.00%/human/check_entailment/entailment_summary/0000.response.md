Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the first condition where if all elements in the list `a` are the same, it prints `-1`.
2. The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty of the array is flawed. The current implementation checks for consecutive segments of the same number and finds the minimum length of such segments. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
3. The program should identify the longest segment of consecutive identical elements and remove all but one element from that segment to ensure the array is no longer beautiful. The minimum number of elements to remove would then be the length of that segment minus one.
4. The current implementation does not account for the possibility of removing elements from different segments to achieve the goal.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not provide the correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
