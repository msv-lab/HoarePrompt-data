Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted list, `t` remains the same as the initial value, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `trump` remains the same as the initial value, `answers` is a list containing strings formatted as 'rank1suit rank2suit', where `rank1` and `rank2` are ranks of cards that were previously unpaired for each suit except `trump`, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None.**

Explanation: The code `trumps = sorted(trumps)` sorts the list `trumps` in ascending order. Since `trumps` was initially an empty list, sorting an empty list does not change its content. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump`, `suits`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
