The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) and a list of `n` integers `a` (the array `a`). After processing each test case, it sorts the array, determines the median, and then performs operations to increment elements in the second half of the array until all elements are greater than the median. The function returns a list named 'results', where each element corresponds to the number of operations required for each test case.
