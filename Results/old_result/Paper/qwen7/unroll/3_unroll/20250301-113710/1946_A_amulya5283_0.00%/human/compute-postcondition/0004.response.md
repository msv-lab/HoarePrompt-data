Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' containing the number of operations required to ensure that all elements in the second half of each array are greater than the median of the array after sorting. Each element in 'results' corresponds to one of the test cases.**

This means that the program will return a list where each element represents the number of operations needed for a specific test case to make all elements in the second half of the sorted array greater than the median. The exact values within the list depend on the input data for each test case.
