#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) and a list of n integers a (the array a).
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the number of operations required to ensure that all elements in the second half of each array are greater than the median of the array after sorting. Each element in `results` corresponds to one of the test cases.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' containing the number of operations required to ensure that all elements in the second half of each array are greater than the median of the array after sorting. Each element in 'results' corresponds to one of the test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) and a list of `n` integers `a` (the array `a`). After processing each test case, it sorts the array, determines the median, and then performs operations to increment elements in the second half of the array until all elements are greater than the median. The function returns a list named 'results', where each element corresponds to the number of operations required for each test case.
