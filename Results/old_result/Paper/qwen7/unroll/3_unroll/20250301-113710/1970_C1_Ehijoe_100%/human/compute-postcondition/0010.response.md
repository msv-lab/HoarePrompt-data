Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of (u, v) pairs representing the edges of an undirected graph, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `ends` is a list containing all the nodes that have exactly one adjacent node in the graph.
