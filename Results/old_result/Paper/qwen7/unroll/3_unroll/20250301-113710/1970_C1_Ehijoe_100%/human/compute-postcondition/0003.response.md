Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, edges is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` where all values are lists. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `edges`, or `empty`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
