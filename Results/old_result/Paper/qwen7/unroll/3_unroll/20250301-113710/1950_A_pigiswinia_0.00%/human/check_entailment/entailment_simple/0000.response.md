Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if the digits satisfy the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If the conditions are met, it prints the corresponding string ("STAIRS" or "PEAK").
5. If the conditions are not met, it prints "NONE".
6. The program handles all possible input cases as per the problem statement.

Given the annotations and the logic within the function, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
