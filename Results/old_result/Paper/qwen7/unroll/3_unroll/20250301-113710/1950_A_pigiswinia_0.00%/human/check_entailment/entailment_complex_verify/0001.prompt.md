You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The exact sequence of these outputs cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs provided during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9, and an integer \(t\) indicating the number of test cases (with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)). For each test case, it prints either 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the relative values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is true.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is true.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.
4. **Output Format**: The program outputs the results in the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

Given that the logic implemented in the function matches the problem requirements exactly, there are no errors in the provided code.

### Correctness:
**True**
