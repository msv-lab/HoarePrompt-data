Output State: `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to n where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to n where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `xx` is a list of length `n` containing the input strings received at each iteration of the loop, `a` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is the count of 'F' received from all inputs at the corresponding index, `b` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is the count of 'S' received from all inputs at the corresponding index.
