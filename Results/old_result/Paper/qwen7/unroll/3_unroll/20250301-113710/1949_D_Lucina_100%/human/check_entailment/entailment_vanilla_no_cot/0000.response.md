Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Transition Videos**:
   - The logic for determining the type of transition videos (funny or scary) is flawed. The program attempts to place 'F' or 'S' based on the count of already decided videos (`a` and `b`), but it does not ensure that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Incomplete Logic**:
   - The program does not fully consider all permutations of scenarios and their impact on the transition video sequence. It only partially handles the placement of 'F' and 'S' based on the initial counts, which is insufficient to guarantee the required constraint.

3. **Logic for Deciding Video Types**:
   - The logic for deciding whether to place 'F' or 'S' when encountering '?' is overly simplistic and does not account for the global constraint across all permutations of scenarios.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the distribution of already decided videos might lead to an invalid solution if not carefully managed.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach, possibly using graph theory or dynamic programming to ensure that the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios. The provided program does not achieve this.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve a more detailed algorithm to ensure that the constraint is met. This could include:
- Constructing a graph where nodes represent scenarios and edges represent transition videos.
- Using a backtracking or constraint satisfaction approach to assign types to undecided videos while ensuring the constraint is met.
- Verifying the solution by checking all permutations of scenarios.

Given the complexity, a correct implementation would likely require a more detailed and rigorous approach than the one provided.
