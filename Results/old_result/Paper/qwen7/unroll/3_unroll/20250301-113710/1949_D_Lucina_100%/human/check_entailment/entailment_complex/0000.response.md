Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first counting the number of 'F' and 'S' decisions for each scenario. Based on these counts, it tries to decide the type of transition videos for the undecided positions ('?') by ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of scenarios.

However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Values**: The program uses `sa` and `sb` to store indices of scenarios with more 'F' and 'S' decisions, respectively. It then tries to assign 'F' or 'S' to undecided values based on these lists. However, the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to undecided values is flawed. Specifically, the condition `i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]` and `i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]` is overly restrictive and does not correctly ensure the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Quarters**: The program uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine the first quarter of `sa` and `sb`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be based on the total number of undecided values and the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

3. **Lack of Proper Constraints Handling**: The program does not properly handle the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. Instead, it relies on a simplistic check that does not guarantee the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
