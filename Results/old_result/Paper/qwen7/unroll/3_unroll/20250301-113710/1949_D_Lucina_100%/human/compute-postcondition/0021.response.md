Postcondition: `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `xx` is a list of `n` strings received during each iteration of the loop, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n+1` with their original counts of 'F' and 'S' respectively, `n` is the original input integer, and `sa` has at least as many elements as `sb`. Additionally, `sb` is no longer an empty list.
