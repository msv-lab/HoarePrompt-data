Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**: The program correctly parses the input and initializes the necessary data structures (`a`, `b`, and `xx`). This part ensures that the counts of 'F' and 'S' are correctly accumulated.

2. **Separation of 'F' and 'S' Indices**: The program correctly separates the indices into `sa` (indices with 'F') and `sb` (indices with 'S'). This separation is crucial for determining the distribution of 'F' and 'S'.

3. **Decision Logic**: 
   - If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the program appends indices where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero to `sa`.
   - If the length of `sb` is greater than the length of `sa`, the program appends indices where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero to `sb`.

4. **Output Construction**:
   - For each scenario, the program constructs a string `nx` based on the existing values in `xx` and the rules defined.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', it takes the value directly.
   - If `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4 - 1` elements of `sb`, it appends 'S'.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'F'.

5. **Handling '?' Values**: The program ensures that '?' values are filled according to the rules, ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' are present in any permutation of scenarios.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles the input and produces a valid output that meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
