You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
def func():
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for t in range(int(input())):
        b = [0] * 26
        n = int(input())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        r = ''
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        print(r)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers `s`. It then maps each integer in `s` to a corresponding character in the alphabet (starting from 'a') based on the count of occurrences of each integer in `s`. Finally, it prints a string composed of these characters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `s`.

2. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - A string `a` containing all lowercase English letters is defined.
   - An array `b` of size 26 (corresponding to the 26 letters of the alphabet) is initialized with zeros. This array will be used to keep track of how many times each letter has appeared so far.

3. **Building the String:**
   - For each index `i` in the trace array `s`, the program finds the corresponding letter in the string `a` using the value at `s[i]` as the index.
   - The letter found is appended to the result string `r`.
   - The count of the chosen letter in the array `b` is incremented to reflect that this letter has now been used.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all indices in the trace array, the constructed string `r` is printed.

### Correctness Check:

- **Trace Interpretation:**
  - The trace array `s` indicates the number of previous occurrences of each character up to that point.
  - The program correctly maps these counts to the appropriate letters in the alphabet.

- **Handling of Multiple Valid Strings:**
  - Since the problem guarantees that there is always a valid string for the given trace, the program should produce one valid string for each test case.
  - The logic of choosing the next letter based on the current count in `b` ensures that the resulting string matches the trace.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where the string length is 1 (e.g., "a") correctly by just printing 'a'.
  - The program also handles cases where the trace array is all zeros (e.g., "aaaaaaa") correctly by repeating the same letter.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to construct a string from its trace. It handles all specified constraints and guarantees, and the implementation is logically sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
