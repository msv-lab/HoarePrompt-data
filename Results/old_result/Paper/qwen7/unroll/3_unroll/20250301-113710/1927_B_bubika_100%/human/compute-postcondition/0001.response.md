Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `t` since the loop iterates over the range of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem states that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the input mechanism**: The loop will iterate based on the user input, which means `t` will take the value of `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid input that falls within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided by the user is within this range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is a valid input within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
