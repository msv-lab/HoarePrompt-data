### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in front of Kirill (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
   - It then reads the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.

2. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - The variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` are adjusted by subtracting 1, which is correct since indexing starts from 0 in Python.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate backward through the queue from `na_frente` to 0.
   - It maintains a variable `best` to keep track of the minimum cost to achieve the desired position.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly handles the conditions for swapping positions and passing through positions:
     - If the current position `v` is within the allowed final position (`v <= pos_final`), it updates `best` and `total` based on whether swapping or passing is cheaper.
     - If the current position `v` is outside the allowed final position, it directly adds the cost of passing through to `total`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `best`, which represents the minimum cost to achieve the desired position.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions.

### Correctness:
