Output State: The output state will consist of `cases` lines, each containing the minimum cost (`best`) found for each test case after executing the given loop. Each test case's result is determined by the logic inside the loop, which calculates the minimum cost to reach `pos_final` from `na_frente` by either swapping or passing, based on the given costs.
