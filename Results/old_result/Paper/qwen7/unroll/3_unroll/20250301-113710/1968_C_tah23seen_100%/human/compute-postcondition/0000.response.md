Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, ans is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `ans` with `n` elements, each set to the value `10 ** 9`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it.
