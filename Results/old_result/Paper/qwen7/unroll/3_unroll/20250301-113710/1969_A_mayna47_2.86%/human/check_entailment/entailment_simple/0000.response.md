Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly handles the input format and constraints specified in the problem statement.
2. For \( n = 2 \), the program directly prints 2, which is correct because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
3. For \( n > 2 \), the program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends' best friends. If such a pair exists, it prints 2, which is correct because inviting both of them ensures at least 2 friends come to the party.
4. If no such pair exists, the program prints 3, which is also correct because inviting any 3 friends will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party (since each friend needs their best friend's best friend to also be invited).

Given this analysis, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
