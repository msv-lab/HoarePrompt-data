Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is an integer read from input and the first element is 0. If `n` is 2, then `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 2, `p` is a list of 2 integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length 3 where each element is an integer read from input and the first element is 0. Otherwise, the value printed is either 2 or nothing, depending on whether the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is met for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`. If the condition is met for at least one `i`, then 2 is printed; otherwise, nothing is printed.
