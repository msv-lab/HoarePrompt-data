Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied. The satisfaction is determined by the number of residents wanting to live on the left (`0`) or right (`1`).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function processes a single test case.
     - It reads the number of houses `n` and the binary string `a`.
     - It calculates the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s up to each house using a list `S`.
     - It iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road there satisfies the conditions.
     - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of unsatisfied residents on the left and right sides.
     - If the conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position is closer to the middle of the village.
   - **func_2()**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Initialization and Cumulative Counts**: The code correctly initializes the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s.
   - **Condition Checking**: The conditions for satisfaction are correctly checked using the cumulative counts.
   - **Optimization**: The function correctly updates the answer `ans` to be the position closest to the middle of the village while satisfying the conditions.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when the entire village is on one side (`000` or `111`), ensuring the road is placed optimally.

Given the analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
