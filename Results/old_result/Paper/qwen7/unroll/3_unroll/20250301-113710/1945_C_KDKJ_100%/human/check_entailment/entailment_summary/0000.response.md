Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the optimal position \( i \) to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied with their side of the street.
2. Function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position \( i \):
   - It iterates through the string `a`, maintaining a running count of '0's and '1's.
   - For each position \( i \), it checks if placing the road there would satisfy the condition for both sides.
   - It keeps track of the position \( i \) that minimizes the absolute difference from \( \frac{n}{2} \).
3. Function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the solution is applied to each test case as required.
4. Both functions handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Given the execution summaries and the code provided, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
