Output State: **`a` is an input string consisting only of '0' and '1', and `n` is the length of the input string `a`; `S` is a list containing sublists where each sublist contains two integers, with the first integer representing the count of '0's encountered in `a` up to the current character, and the second integer representing the count of '1's encountered up to the current character; `ans` is -1.**

The code simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the initial state. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, and `S` remain unchanged, and `ans` is set to `-1`.
