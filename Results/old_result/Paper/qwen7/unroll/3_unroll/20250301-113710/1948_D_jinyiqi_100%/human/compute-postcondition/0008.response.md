Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It searches for the longest substring within `s` where each character either matches the corresponding character in the mirrored position or is a question mark. If such a substring exists, it prints twice the length of this substring; otherwise, it prints 0.**
