Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

The code calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` and the content of the list `s` remain unchanged.
