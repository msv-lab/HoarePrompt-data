Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to find the longest substring that forms a tandem repeat by replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter. However, there are a few issues with the logic in the `func_1()` function that need to be addressed:

1. The function does not actually perform any replacements of question marks (`'?'`). Instead, it checks if a substring could potentially form a tandem repeat without considering the possibility of replacing question marks with appropriate characters.
2. The logic for counting potential tandem repeats is flawed. The variable `count` is incremented regardless of whether the characters match or not, which does not correctly simulate the process of replacing question marks.
3. The function should iterate through all possible replacements of question marks and check for the longest tandem repeat substring after each replacement.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
