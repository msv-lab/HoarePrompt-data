Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value between 1 and 1000. The variable `s` now holds a list of characters from the input string, which can include lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
