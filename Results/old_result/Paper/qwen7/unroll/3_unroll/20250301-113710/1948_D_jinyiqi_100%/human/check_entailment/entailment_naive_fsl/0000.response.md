Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic inside `func_1` does not ensure that all question marks are replaced to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Instead, it checks for the presence of question marks or matching characters without ensuring the optimal replacement of question marks.

For example, consider the input `"code?????s"`. The program will output `10`, but the optimal solution would be to replace the question marks to form `"codessssssas"`, which results in a tandem repeat substring of length `10`. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this optimal replacement.

To fix this, the program needs to attempt different replacements of question marks and keep track of the maximum tandem repeat length found. This involves generating all possible valid strings by replacing question marks and checking each one for the longest tandem repeat substring.
