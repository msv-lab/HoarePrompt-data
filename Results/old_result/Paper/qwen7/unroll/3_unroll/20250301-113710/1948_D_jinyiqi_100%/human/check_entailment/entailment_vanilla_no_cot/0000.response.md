Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to handle the problem requirements:**
   - The function `func_1` does not actually replace the question marks with lowercase Latin letters.
   - It checks for tandem repeats without considering the replacement of question marks.

2. **Logic for finding tandem repeats is flawed:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly identify the longest possible tandem repeat after replacing question marks with appropriate lowercase letters.

3. **No attempt to maximize the length of the tandem repeat:**
   - The program does not attempt to find the best way to replace question marks to maximize the length of the tandem repeat.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to:
- Replace each '?' with a lowercase letter to form the longest possible tandem repeat.
- Check all possible replacements to ensure the longest tandem repeat is found.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    
    def is_tandem_repeat(s):
        for i in range(n // 2):
            if s[i] != '?' and s[i] != s[n - i - 1]:
                return False
        return True
    
    max_length = 0
    for combination in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', repeat=n):
        replaced_s = ''.join(combination)
        for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            if is_tandem_repeat(replaced_s[:i]):
                max_length = max(max_length, i * 2)
                break
    
    print(max_length)
```

This corrected version:
- Uses a helper function `is_tandem_repeat` to check if a given string is a tandem repeat.
- Iterates over all possible combinations of lowercase letters to replace the question marks.
- Finds the longest possible tandem repeat by checking each combination.
