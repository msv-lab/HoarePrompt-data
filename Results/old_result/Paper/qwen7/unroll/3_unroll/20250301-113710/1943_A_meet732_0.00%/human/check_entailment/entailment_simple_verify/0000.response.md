### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the game rules and calculates the MEX value optimally.

#### Problem Analysis
- **Alice's Turn**: Alice picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`, then removes it from `a`.
- **Bob's Turn**: Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
- **Game Ends**: When `a` is empty.
- **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - Create a count array `cntl` to keep track of how many times each element appears in `a`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, the MEX is `0` because `0` cannot be in `c`.
   - Otherwise, initialize `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`.
   - Iterate through the elements from `1` to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, decrement `c`.
     - If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, print `j` and break.

#### Key Issues
1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - The program does not simulate Alice's optimal strategy. Alice should always pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX value.
   
2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - The program does not simulate Bob's optimal strategy. Bob should always pick the smallest available element to minimize the MEX value.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX value after each player's turn. It only checks the count array once and prints the result without simulating the game.

#### Example Test Case
Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Program Execution**:
- Alice picks `0` (cntl[0] becomes 1).
- Bob picks `0` (cntl[0] becomes 0).
- Alice picks `1` (cntl[1] becomes 1).
- Bob picks `1` (cntl[1] becomes 0).

At the end, `cntl` is `[0, 0, 1]`. The MEX of `[1]` is `0`, but the correct MEX should be `2` based on the optimal play.

The program incorrectly calculates the MEX without considering the optimal moves for both players. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the game rules and the calculation of the MEX value. It fails to simulate the optimal strategies of both players and does not accurately compute the MEX value after each turn.
