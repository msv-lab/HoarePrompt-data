Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` with all zeros.
   - It counts the occurrences of each element in the array `a` using `cntl`.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If there are no zeros (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX must be `0` because `0` is not present in the array.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the MEX as follows:
     - Initialize `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0`s.
     - For each index `j` from `1` to `n`, if the count of `j` is less than `2`, decrement `c` by `1`.
     - If `c` becomes `0` or the loop reaches the end of the array, the MEX is `j`.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case 1: `0 0 1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `2`, `c` is set to `2`.
- Loop through `j` from `1` to `2`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1]` is `2`, so `c` remains `2`.
  - `j = 2`: `cntl[2]` is `0`, so `c` becomes `1`.
- The output is `1`, which is correct.

#### Test Case 2: `0 1 2 3`
- `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `1`, `c` is set to `1`.
- Loop through `j` from `1` to `4`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1]` is `1`, so `c` becomes `0`.
- The output is `1`, which is incorrect. The correct MEX should be `0`.

#### Test Case 3: `1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `0`, the output is `0`, which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the first and third test cases but fails to produce the correct MEX for the second test case. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
