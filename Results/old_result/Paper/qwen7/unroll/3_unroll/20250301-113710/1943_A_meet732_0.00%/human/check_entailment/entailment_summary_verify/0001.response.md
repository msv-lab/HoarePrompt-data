### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` with all zeros.
   - It correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the array `a` using `cntl`.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If there are no zeros (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX must be `0` because `0` is not present in the array.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the MEX as follows:
     - Initialize `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0`s.
     - For each index `j` from `1` to `n`, if the count of `j` is less than `2`, decrement `c` by `1`.
     - If `c` becomes `0` or the loop reaches the end of the array, the MEX is `j`.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case 1: `0 0 1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `2`, `c` is set to `2`.
- Loop through `j` from `1` to `2`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1]` is `2`, so `c` remains `2`.
  - `j = 2`: `cntl[2]` is `0`, so `c` becomes `1`.
- The output is `1`, which is correct.

#### Test Case 2: `0 1 2 3`
- `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `1`, `c` is set to `1`.
- Loop through `j` from `1` to `4`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1]` is `1`, so `c` becomes `0`.
- The output is `1`, which is incorrect. The correct MEX should be `0`.

#### Test Case 3: `1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`.
- Since `cntl[0]` is `0`, the output is `0`, which is correct.

### Analysis of the Given Program

The program logic is flawed in the second test case. Specifically, the logic to calculate the MEX is incorrect. The program should handle the optimal strategy for both players, ensuring that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

### Correct Solution

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the optimal moves for both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        # Alice's turn: pick 0 if available
        if cntl[0] > 0:
            cntl[0] -= 1
            c = 0
        else:
            c = 1
        
        # Bob's turn: pick 1 if available, otherwise 2, and so on
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] > 0:
                cntl[j] -= 1
                c = j
                break
        
        print(c)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Final Evaluation

The original program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for both players. The corrected solution ensures that Alice picks `0` if available and Bob picks the smallest available number that minimizes the MEX.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
