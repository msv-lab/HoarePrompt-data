Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. After executing the loop, if cntl[0] is not zero, then c is the minimum value between 2 and cntl[0], and for each j from 1 to n, if cntl[j] is less than 2, c is decremented by 1. If c becomes 0 or j reaches n, the program prints j and breaks the loop.
