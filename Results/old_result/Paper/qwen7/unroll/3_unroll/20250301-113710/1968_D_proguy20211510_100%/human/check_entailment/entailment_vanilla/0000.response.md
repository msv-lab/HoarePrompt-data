### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
2. **Permutation and Array Input**: The program correctly reads and stores the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
3. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**:
   - The program initializes two lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - For Bodya, it starts from `pb-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - Similarly, for Sasha, it starts from `ps-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha using the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
   - It updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha accordingly.
5. **Output Determination**:
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares them and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Analysis:

- The logic for parsing and storing the permutation and array is correct.
- The path calculation for both players is implemented correctly.
- The score calculation logic is also correct, considering the remaining turns and the accumulated scores.
- The output determination is handled correctly based on the comparison of the final scores.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: **True**
