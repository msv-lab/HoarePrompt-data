Output State: **The output will be determined based on the maximum value between `resb` and `ress` for each iteration. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, "Bodya" will be printed; if `ress` is greater than `resb`, "Sasha" will be printed; otherwise, "Draw" will be printed. The specific values of `resb` and `ress` depend on the input values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a`.**
