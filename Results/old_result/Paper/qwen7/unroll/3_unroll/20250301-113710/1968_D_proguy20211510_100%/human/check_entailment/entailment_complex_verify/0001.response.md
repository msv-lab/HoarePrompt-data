### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - This part is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Permutation and Array Input**:
   - The program correctly reads and stores the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - This part is also correct and handles the input as expected.

3. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**:
   - The program initializes two lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - For Bodya, it starts from `pb-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - Similarly, for Sasha, it starts from `ps-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - This part is correct and ensures that the paths are calculated correctly without revisiting positions.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha using the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
   - It updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha accordingly.
   - However, the score calculation logic has a flaw. The formula used to calculate the score is incorrect. Specifically, the formula should consider the total score accumulated up to the current position plus the remaining turns' scores, but the current implementation only considers the remaining turns' scores without accumulating the previous scores correctly.
   - For example, if `k = 5` and the path is `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25]`, the correct score should be the sum of the entire path, not just the last few elements.

5. **Output Determination**:
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares them and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
   - The output determination is handled correctly based on the comparison of the final scores, but the scores themselves are incorrect due to the flawed score calculation logic.

### Analysis:

- The logic for parsing and storing the permutation and array is correct.
- The path calculation for both players is implemented correctly.
- The score calculation logic is incorrect, leading to wrong scores being computed.
- The output determination is based on incorrect scores, leading to wrong results.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is correct because it did not identify the flaw in the score calculation logic. The program fails to accumulate the scores correctly, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
