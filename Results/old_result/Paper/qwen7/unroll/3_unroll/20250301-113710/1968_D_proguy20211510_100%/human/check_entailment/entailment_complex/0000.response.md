Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for each test case, including \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), the permutation \( p \), and the array \( a \).
2. It initializes two paths for Bodya and Sasha, ensuring that each path respects the rules of moving according to the permutation \( p \) and accumulating scores based on the array \( a \).
3. The program calculates the maximum possible sum of \( k \) consecutive elements for each path using a loop that iterates up to \( k \) times.
4. The logic for determining the winner (or if it's a draw) is correct. It compares the maximum sums for both paths and prints the appropriate result based on the comparison.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem statement accurately and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
