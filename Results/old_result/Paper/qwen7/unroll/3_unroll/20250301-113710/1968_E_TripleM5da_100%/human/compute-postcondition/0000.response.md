Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state of `t`**: Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is within this range. This ensures that the loop can execute at least once.

5. **Adjust the state of `i`**: We know that `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is within the valid range for `t`, and `i` starts at 0.

**State after adjustment**:
- `t` should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 50\) to ensure the loop can execute at least once.
- `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

So, the final state is:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 0**.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 0**.
