Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as a subsequence in `s`.
- The provided solution constructs a string `s` by repeating the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, which contains the first 20 lowercase English alphabets.
- This approach will not work correctly for all cases because:
  - If `k > 20`, the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` does not contain all required characters.
  - Even if `k <= 20`, the constructed string `s` might not have the minimal length required to include all subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
