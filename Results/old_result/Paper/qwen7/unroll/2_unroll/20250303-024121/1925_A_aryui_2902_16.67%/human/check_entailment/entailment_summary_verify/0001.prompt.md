You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
import collections
from collections import Counter
from collections import defaultdict
import math
from math import log

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 26\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 26\). It then constructs and returns a string consisting of the first \(k\) characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw', repeated \(n\) times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a potential issue because the function is not being called with the correct parameters for each test case.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The string `s` is defined as `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, which contains the first 20 lowercase English alphabets.
   - The function returns `s[:k] * n`, which repeats the substring `s[:k]` exactly `n` times.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Function Not Called:**
   - The main loop calls `res = func_1()`, but `func_1()` does not use the values of `n` and `k` provided in the input. Instead, it always returns the same string, regardless of `n` and `k`.

2. **Incorrect String Generation:**
   - The string `s` only contains 20 characters, but the problem states that `k` can be up to 26. Therefore, if `k > 20`, the program will fail to generate the required string.

3. **Output Requirement:**
   - The problem requires the generated string to include all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The current implementation does not meet this requirement.

### Correct Implementation:

To meet the requirements, we need to construct a string that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. One way to achieve this is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def de_bruijn(k, n):
    def db(t, p):
        if len(p) == n:
            result.append(''.join(p))
            return
        for c in range(k):
            db(t+1, p + [c])
    
    result = []
    db(0, [])
    return result

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    subsequences = de_bruijn(k, n)
    # Generate the shortest string that contains all subsequences
    # as a subsequence
    s = subsequences[0]
    for seq in subsequences[1:]:
        i = s.find(seq)
        while i != -1:
            s = s[:i+1] + seq[i:] + s[i+1:]
            i = s.find(seq, i+1)
    return s

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **De Bruijn Sequence Generation:**
   - The `de_bruijn` function generates all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   
2. **String Construction:**
   - The `func_1` function constructs the shortest string that contains all these subsequences as a subsequence by merging them efficiently.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop reads the test cases and prints the result of `func_1()` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned. The corrected program meets the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the original program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
