Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 676. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the specified range, while `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers.
