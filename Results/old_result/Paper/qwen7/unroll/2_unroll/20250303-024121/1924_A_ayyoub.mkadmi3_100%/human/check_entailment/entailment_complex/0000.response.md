Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` to create two strings `s1` and `s2`.
   - `s1` contains all characters from `s` that are in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `s2` contains a single character from `s` if there is exactly one character in the first `k` alphabets that is present in `s`.
   - The function then calculates a value `r` based on the length of `s1` and returns a tuple consisting of a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates through each test case, calls `func_1`, and checks the returned values.
   - If the boolean value in the returned tuple is `False`, it means that the length of `s1` is less than `n * k`, indicating that not all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - In such a case, the program constructs a string `be9i` that is not a subsequence of `s` and appends both 'No' and `be9i` to the output list `OUT`.
   - If the boolean value is `True`, it means that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`, and the program appends 'Yes' to the output list `OUT`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `s1` might be shorter than `n * k`.
   - The construction of `be9i` ensures that a string of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not a subsequence of `s` is generated and appended to the output list `OUT`.

Given the analysis, the program logic matches the problem statement and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
