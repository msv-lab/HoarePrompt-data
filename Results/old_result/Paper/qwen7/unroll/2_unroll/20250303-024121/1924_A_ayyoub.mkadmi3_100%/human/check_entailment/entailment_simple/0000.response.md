Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` and checks if it contains all necessary characters to form all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It maintains two strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` accumulates characters from `s` that are in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `s2` stores the last character encountered if `len(alphabet)` becomes 1.
   - After processing `s`, it checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. If so, it returns `True` and the relevant substrings. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates over each test case, calls `func_1`, and processes the output.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it constructs a string `be9i` that represents a sequence of characters not found in `s1` and appends it to `s2` to form a string of length `n`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".

3. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `len(alphabet)` becomes 1, storing the single character in `s2`.
   - The logic for constructing `be9i` ensures that a string of length `n` is formed using characters not present in `s1` when necessary.
   - The main program correctly formats and prints the results based on the output of `func_1`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and handles all specified cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
