Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` and `s2`.
   - It uses a set `alphabet` to keep track of the characters needed.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if each character is in the `alphabet`.
     - If the character is in the `alphabet`, it removes the character from the `alphabet` if more than one character is needed.
     - Otherwise, it appends the character to `s1` and resets the `alphabet` to the full set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - It also appends the character to `s2` if it is the last character needed to form a valid sequence.
   - Finally, it returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)` where `r` is the quotient when `len(s1)` is divided by `k`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result in `OUT`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it means not all required subsequences exist in `s`.
     - It appends 'No' to `OUT`.
     - It constructs a string `be9i` by repeating the first unused character `n - len(s2)` times and appends `s2 + be9i` to `OUT`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it appends 'Yes' to `OUT`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints each element of `OUT`.

### Verification:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters, the program should output 'YES'.
  - If `s` does not contain all possible subsequences, the program should output 'NO' followed by a counterexample string of length `n`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The logic in `func_1` seems correct in terms of identifying missing subsequences. However, there are a few points to verify:
    - The removal of characters from `alphabet` might not be necessary if we only need to check the presence of all subsequences.
    - The construction of `s1` and `s2` ensures that all required characters are tracked.

- **Overall Logic:**
  - The main logic in the main part of the program correctly handles the output based on the results of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It checks for the presence of all possible subsequences and outputs the appropriate result.

**Correctness: True**
