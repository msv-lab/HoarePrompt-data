Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` to extract characters that belong to the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `s1` is constructed by appending characters from `s` that are within the first `k` alphabets.
   - `s2` is set to an empty string unless there is exactly one character in the first `k` alphabets present in `s`, in which case it is set to that character.
   - The variable `r` is calculated as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - The function returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks the returned boolean value.
   - If the boolean value is `False`, it prints "No" and constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using the first `k` alphabets, which is not present in `s1`.
   - If the boolean value is `True`, it prints "Yes".

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - The main program correctly handles the output based on the result of `func_1`.
   - The construction of `be9i` ensures that a string not present in `s` is generated when needed.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
