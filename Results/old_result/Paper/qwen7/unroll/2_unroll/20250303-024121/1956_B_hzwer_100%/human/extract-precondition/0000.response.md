Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the input consists of t test cases. For each test case, n is the number of cards you and Nene receive initially, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times in the sequence.**
