Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes t test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n as input. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

- Each test case is defined by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is provided, representing the number of cards.
- A list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) is also provided, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice.

The function processes each test case and returns a result accordingly.
