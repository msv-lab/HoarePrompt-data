Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and calculates the maximum number of pairs of identical numbers that can be formed by decrementing each element by one until no two elements are the same. Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the total count of such pairs.**
