Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the loop counter, which is `_`. However, since we typically use a meaningful variable name like `t` for this purpose, we can infer that the loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is read from the input using `int(input())`. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should include the condition that `t` is a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

3. **Consider the Input**: The input is read from `sys.stdin.readline`, but this does not affect the initial state before the loop starts. It is the value of `t` that determines how many times the loop will run.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a valid integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
