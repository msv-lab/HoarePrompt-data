Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the input consists of t test cases. For each test case, n is the number of cards you and Nene receive initially, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times in the sequence. The function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

Explanation: The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`, which changes how input is read from the standard input. However, this does not affect the values of `t` and `n` or the structure of the input data. Therefore, the conditions and structure of the initial state remain unchanged, and only the method of reading input is updated.
