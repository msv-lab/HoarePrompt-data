Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and strictly increasing; and `b`, a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. It returns a new list based on a specific condition. If the length of list `a` is less than or equal to the length of list `b`, it returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in list `a`. Otherwise, it returns list `b` unchanged.**
