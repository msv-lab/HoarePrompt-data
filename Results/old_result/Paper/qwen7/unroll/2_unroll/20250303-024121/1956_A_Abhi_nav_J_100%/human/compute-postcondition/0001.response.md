Output State: **The program returns a list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'**

This means that for each integer `a_i` in the list `a`, the program returns `a_i - 1`. Since `a` is a list of `k` integers and `1 ≤ k ≤ 100`, the output will be a list of `k` integers, each being the original value minus one.
