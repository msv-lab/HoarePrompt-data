#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100. b is a list of q integers representing the values n_i where 1 ≤ q ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list 'b' which contains q integers representing the values n_i where 1 ≤ q ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and strictly increasing; and `b`, a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. It returns a new list based on a specific condition. If the length of list `a` is less than or equal to the length of list `b`, it returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in list `a`. Otherwise, it returns list `b` unchanged.
