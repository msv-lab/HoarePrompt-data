Output State: The output state consists of two integers, `mak2` and `pans[mak]`, which represent the result of the loop's operations. Specifically, `mak2` is the result of the first part of the loop where the goal is to find a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The second part of the loop aims to find the index `pans[mak]` that maximizes the XOR operation with `mak2`. The final output is these two values.
