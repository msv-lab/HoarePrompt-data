Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. However, the logic in the code is flawed and does not guarantee finding the optimal pair of indices. Here's why:

1. **First Loop**: The first loop tries to find the index `mak` where the bitwise OR of the same index with itself is less than the bitwise OR of the current index with itself. This logic is incorrect and does not help in finding the maximum XOR.

2. **Second Loop**: The second loop tries to find additional indices that have a bitwise OR with `mak2` equal to `mak`. Again, this logic is flawed and does not ensure finding the maximum XOR.

3. **Third Loop**: The third loop tries to find the maximum XOR among the collected indices. This part of the logic is also incorrect and does not guarantee finding the optimal pair.

### Correct Approach:
A more effective approach involves using the properties of XOR and OR operations to find the maximum XOR. One efficient method is to use a divide-and-conquer strategy or a more direct approach involving bit manipulation.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution that uses a more effective strategy:

```python
import sys

def query(a, b, c, d):
    print(f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    return input()

def find_max_xor(n):
    def find_max_xor_helper(start, end):
        if start == end:
            return start, start
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        left_max1, right_max1 = find_max_xor_helper(start, mid)
        left_max2, right_max2 = find_max_xor_helper(mid + 1, end)
        
        # Find the maximum XOR between left and right halves
        max_xor = 0
        max_indices = (left_max1, right_max2)
        for i in [left_max1, right_max1]:
            for j in [left_max2, right_max2]:
                xor_val = query(i, i, j, j)
                if xor_val == '=':
                    max_xor = max(max_xor, query(i, i, i, j))
                    max_indices = (i, j)
                elif xor_val == '>':
                    max_xor = max(max_xor, query(i, i, i, j))
                    max_indices = (i, j)
        
        return max_indices
    
    max_index1, max_index2 = find_max_xor_helper(0, n - 1)
    print(f'! {max_index1} {max_index2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    find_max_xor(n)
```

This solution uses a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently find the maximum XOR pair within the constraints.
