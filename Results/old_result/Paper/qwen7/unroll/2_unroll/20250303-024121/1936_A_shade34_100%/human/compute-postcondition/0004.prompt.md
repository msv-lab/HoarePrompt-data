You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires the function to interact with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. The variable n is an integer representing the length of the permutation, and the permutation itself is fixed but unknown. The function must make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of two integers, `mak2` and `pans[mak]`, which represent the result of the loop's operations. Specifically, `mak2` is the result of the first part of the loop where the goal is to find a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The second part of the loop aims to find the index `pans[mak]` that maximizes the XOR operation with `mak2`. The final output is these two values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and interacts with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. It aims to find a pair of indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of elements at these indices (p_i ⊕ p_j) is maximized, by making at most 3n queries where n is the length of the permutation.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
