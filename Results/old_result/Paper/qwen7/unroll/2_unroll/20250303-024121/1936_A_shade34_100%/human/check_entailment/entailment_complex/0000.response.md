Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code iterates through the test cases.
   - For each test case, it first determines a candidate index `mak` by comparing the bitwise OR of elements at the same index.
   - It then identifies another index `pans[mak]` that maximizes the bitwise XOR with `mak`.
   - Finally, it outputs the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]`.

3. **Query Analysis**:
   - The first loop (`for i in range(1, n):`) compares \(p_{mak} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{mak} \mid p_i\) to find the index `mak` that maximizes the bitwise OR with itself.
   - The second loop (`for i in range(n):`) compares \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2}\) with \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\) to find the index `pans[mak]` that maximizes the bitwise XOR with `mak2`.
   - The third loop (`for i in range(1, len(pans)):`) ensures that the selected index `pans[mak]` indeed maximizes the bitwise XOR with `mak2`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The approach of finding `mak` by comparing the bitwise OR of elements at the same index is sound.
   - The method of finding `pans[mak]` by comparing the bitwise XOR with `mak2` is also correct.
   - The constraints and the logic within the loops ensure that the solution adheres to the problem's requirements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code correctly implements the logic to find the required indices using at most \(3n\) queries.
   - The output format and the interaction with the external entity are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
