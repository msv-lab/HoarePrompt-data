Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the function validates the values of n and k (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), and returns a result based on these values.**
