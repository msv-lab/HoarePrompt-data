Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a non-negative integer. Since the problem specifies that the input is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the loop will always execute at least once.

3. **Determine the initial state adjustments**: We need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) for the loop to execute correctly. Given that `t` is already defined as a positive integer within this range, no additional adjustments are needed for `t`.

4. **Consider the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but since the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once due to the constraints, we don't need to make any assumptions about the state after the loop.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be considered is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`, which is represented by the variable `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
