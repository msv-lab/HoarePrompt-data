You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

    #State: Output State: t test cases are processed. For each test case, if n is 1, the output is k. Otherwise, the output is a list containing two elements: (2^i - 1) and (k - (2^i - 1)), followed by enough zeros to make the list length equal to n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program simply prints `k`. This is correct because the single element must equal `k` to satisfy the sum condition.

3. **Multiple Elements Case:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program constructs an array `ans` with `n` elements.
   - It initializes `temp` to 1 and iterates to find the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - It appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans` (this is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `i`-th bit).
   - It then appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the array equals `k`.
   - Finally, it appends zeros to `ans` until its length reaches `n`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Handling Multiple Elements:**
   - The logic for constructing the array `ans` is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers the largest power of 2 less than `k` and does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the elements.
   - For example, consider `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The program would output `[1, 2]`, but the optimal solution should be `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]` to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR (which is 3 in both cases).

2. **Maximizing Bitwise OR:**
   - The program does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized. Instead, it focuses on constructing numbers that sum to `k` without considering the bitwise OR constraint.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the elements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
