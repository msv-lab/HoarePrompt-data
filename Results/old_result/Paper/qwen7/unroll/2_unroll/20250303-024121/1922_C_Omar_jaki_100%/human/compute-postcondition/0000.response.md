Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` which reads multiple integers from input, splits them by spaces, and maps them to integers. However, no actual input is taken or variables are assigned values in this snippet, so the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged. The lambda function `r` is created but does not affect the existing variables.
