You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

    2 2
    
    2 3
    
    5 0
    
    0 1 2 2 1

Output

    2
    2
    1
    2
    3
    -1
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

    #State: Output State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is 14.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from 29 down to 0. The key logic in the loop involves checking bits of a list `a` and updating `ans` based on certain conditions. Since the loop iterates over each bit position and the final value of `ans` is set to the maximum count of consecutive zeros found in any bit position, and given the range of iteration (29 to 0), the maximum possible value for `ans` is half of the number of iterations, which is 14. The list `t` remains empty as no elements are appended to it during the loop's execution.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns 14, which is the maximum count of consecutive zeros found in any bit position of the list `a`. The list `t` remains empty as no elements are appended to it during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `a` of `n` integers (each less than \(2^{30}\)) and an integer `x` (though `x` is not used in the function). It iterates through each bit position from 29 down to 0, checking for consecutive zeros in the bit positions of the integers in list `a`. It updates the variable `ans` to store the maximum count of consecutive zeros found across all integers in the list. The function ensures that a list `t` remains empty, as no elements are appended to it during the loop's execution. Finally, it returns the maximum count of consecutive zeros (`ans`).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array `a` is empty or when `n` is 1 but `x` is not 0. Here’s an example that demonstrates the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
1 1
0
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `1` because we can select the segment `[1, 1]` and the XOR result is `0`, which is less than or equal to `1`.

However, the current implementation will return `-1` because it does not handle the case where `n` is 1 and `x` is not 0. The program checks the bits from 29 down to 0, and since `n` is 1, the loop will not execute, leading to the default value of `-1`.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `n` is 1 explicitly. Here is a modified version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_4():
    (n, x) = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    
    if n == 1:
        if x >= a[0]:
            return 1
        else:
            return -1
    
    (t, ans) = ([], -1)
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        (u, v) = (x >> i & 1, sum([val >> i & 1 for val in a]))
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                (a, t) = (t, [])
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
    return max(ans, len(a))
```

This modification ensures that the program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, thus making the solution complete and correct according to the problem description.
