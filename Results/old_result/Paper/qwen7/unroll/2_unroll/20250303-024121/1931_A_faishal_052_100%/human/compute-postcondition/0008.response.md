Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer t where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 for each test case, and for each test case, n is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**

However, since the function definition itself does not take any parameters (`def func():`), the description should clarify that the function is designed to handle a series of test cases with specific constraints on `t` and `n`, but the function itself does not directly accept or return these values. Instead, it seems to generate or process values within the given ranges.
