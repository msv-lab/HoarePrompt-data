You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: Output State: `info` is a list of lists where each inner list contains four elements. The first two elements are either 1 or 26 depending on the value of `lex` after processing, and the last element is the remaining value of `lex` after it has been reduced by multiples of 26 or 1. Each inner list is sorted. The exact contents of `info` depend on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: Output State: After executing the loop, the output state will consist of a series of strings printed to the console. Each string is formed by converting the third element of each inner list in `info` (after reducing `lex` by multiples of 26 or 1) into characters using the formula `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `cases-1` and `j` ranges from `0` to `2`. These characters are then concatenated to form a string for each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer t where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 for each test case, and for each test case, n is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
