You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())

                arr.append(1)

            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)

        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: Output State: `info` is a list of lists where each inner list contains four elements. The first two elements are either 1 or 26 depending on the value of `lex` after processing, and the last element is the remaining value of `lex` after it has been reduced by multiples of 26 or 1. Each inner list is sorted. The exact contents of `info` depend on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: Output State: After executing the loop, the output state will consist of a series of strings printed to the console. Each string is formed by converting the third element of each inner list in `info` (after reducing `lex` by multiples of 26 or 1) into characters using the formula `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `cases-1` and `j` ranges from `0` to `2`. These characters are then concatenated to form a string for each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each case consists of an integer `lex`. For each case, it processes `lex` to determine its value relative to 28 and 52, appends the result to a list, sorts the list, and then converts specific elements of the list into characters. It prints a series of strings formed by these characters for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. For example, consider the encoded value `55`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"czz"`, but the program outputs `"azz"` instead. This happens because the program logic does not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining value after assigning the maximum possible value to the last character. Here's a breakdown of why it fails:

- For `n = 55`:
  - The program assigns `26` to the second character, leaving `29` for the third character.
  - It then incorrectly assigns `1` to the first character, resulting in `"azz"`.
  - The correct assignment should be `"czz"`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the first character is assigned the smallest possible value while still allowing the remaining value to be distributed correctly among the other two characters.
