Output State: **`cases` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ cases ≤ 100, and `info` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `info`. This does not change the value of `cases` or provide any new information about its value. Therefore, `cases` remains an input integer within the specified range, and `info` is now an empty list.
