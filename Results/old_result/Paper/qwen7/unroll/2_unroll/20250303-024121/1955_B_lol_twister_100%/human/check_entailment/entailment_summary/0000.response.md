Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies the minimum value in the input list `l` and uses this minimum value to construct a new list `li` that represents the expected order of values in a progressive square.
2. The construction of `li` ensures that each element is calculated as \(a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h\), where \(a\) is the minimum value in `l`, and \(k\) and \(h\) are the row and column indices, respectively.
3. The program then sorts both `l` and `li` and checks if they are equal. This comparison is correct because if the original list `l` contained the elements of a progressive square in some permutation, sorting them should yield the same result as sorting the constructed list `li`.
4. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if the given list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\).

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
