### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. A progressive square is defined such that each element can be calculated using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d` and the array `l`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to check if the array `l` can form a progressive square.
   - In `func_1`, the minimum value in `l` is identified as `a_{1,1}`.
   - A list `li` is generated containing all possible values of the progressive square using the formula \(a + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\) for all positions in the \(n \times n\) matrix.
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted and compared. If they match, it means the array `l` can form a progressive square, and "yes" is returned; otherwise, "no" is returned.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the starting value (`a_{1,1}`) and generates all possible values of the progressive square.
   - Sorting both lists ensures that the order of elements is irrelevant, only their presence and correctness matter.
   - The comparison of sorted lists correctly determines if the array `l` can form a progressive square.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. Specifically, the formula used to generate the values in `li` is incorrect. The formula should be \(a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d\) instead of \(a + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\), where `k` and `h` are the row and column indices, respectively. This means that the current implementation will not generate the correct sequence of values for the progressive square.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
```

- The correct progressive square for \(n = 3\), \(c = 2\), and \(d = 3\) would be:
  ```
  3  9  12
  5  11 14
  7  13 16
  ```

- The sorted list `li` generated by the current implementation would be:
  ```
  3  5  7  9 10 11 12 13 14 16
  ```

- However, the sorted list `l` is:
  ```
  3  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 14
  ```

Since the two lists do not match, the program incorrectly outputs "NO". The correct answer should be "YES" because the list `l` can indeed form the correct progressive square.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate due to the incorrect formula used to generate the values in `li`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
