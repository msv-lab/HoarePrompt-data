Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`numCases`) and processing each test case individually.

2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the program reads `2n` integers and stores them in a list called `numbers`. It then sorts this list in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. Sorting ensures that when we pop the first two elements, they are the smallest available integers, which is optimal for maximizing the score.

3. **Scoring Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list in pairs, popping the first two elements (which are the smallest remaining integers) and adding their minimum value to the score (`suma`). This process continues until the list is empty.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total score for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible score for each test case by always selecting the two smallest integers at each step, which is the optimal strategy.

Correctness: **True**
