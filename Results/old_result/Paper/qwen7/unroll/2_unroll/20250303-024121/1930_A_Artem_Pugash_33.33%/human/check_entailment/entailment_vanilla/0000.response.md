Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `numCases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `numInteger` (which is `2n`).
   - It then reads the list of integers as a string and splits it into individual elements.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`).

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - A loop runs until the list `numbers` is empty.
   - In each iteration, the smallest two elements are popped from the list, their minimum value is added to the score, and the loop continues.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The final score is printed for each test case.

### Reasoning

1. **Sorting the List:**
   - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are always considered first when taking the minimum of pairs.

2. **Popping Elements:**
   - Popping the first two elements in each iteration ensures that the smallest available elements are always paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimums.

3. **Ensuring Correctness:**
   - Since the list is sorted and the smallest elements are always paired, this approach guarantees that the maximum score is achieved. This is because any other pairing would result in a smaller minimum value being added to the score at some point.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always pairing the smallest available elements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
