Output State: **`numCases` is an input integer, and the initial state of `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input which is assigned to the variable `numCases`. This changes the value of `numCases`, but does not affect the value of `t`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
