Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Bit Representation**: The initial bit representation of `x` is constructed from the least significant bit to the most significant bit, but it should be done in reverse order. This means the list `s` should be reversed before printing.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Bits**: The logic to handle consecutive non-zero bits is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if flag and s[i] == '0':` and subsequent changes to the list `s` do not correctly ensure that no two consecutive non-zero bits exist.

3. **Appending Extra Bit**: The logic to append an extra bit at the end if necessary is incorrect. It should ensure that the resulting array meets the criteria without appending extra bits unnecessarily.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        # Construct the binary representation of x in reverse order
        while x > 0:
            s.append(str(x % 2))
            x //= 2
        # Reverse the list to get the correct order
        s.reverse()
        # Convert '1' to '1', '0' to '0', and '2' to '-1' (since we are using strings)
        s = ['1' if c == '1' else ('-1' if c == '2' else '0') for c in s]
        # Ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] != '0' and s[i + 1] != '0':
                s[i + 1] = '0'
        # Determine the length of the array
        length = len(s)
        print(length)
        print(*s)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary representation of `x` is correctly constructed, handles consecutive non-zero bits properly, and outputs the array in the required format.
