Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each test case, it reads \( x \), converts it to its binary representation, and applies a series of transformations based on specific rules. The final output for each test case includes the new length of the binary representation and the modified binary string.**
