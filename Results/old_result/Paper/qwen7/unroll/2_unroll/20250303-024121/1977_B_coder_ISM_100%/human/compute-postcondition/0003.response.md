Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each value of t, the variable `x` is an integer read from input, and `s` is a list of strings representing the binary representation of `x` with some modifications based on specific rules. After processing, `length` is updated to reflect the new length of the list `s`. The final output consists of the new length and the modified list `s` printed line by line.
