You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each value of t, the variable `x` is an integer read from input, and `s` is a list of strings representing the binary representation of `x` with some modifications based on specific rules. After processing, `length` is updated to reflect the new length of the list `s`. The final output consists of the new length and the modified list `s` printed line by line.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a list `s` representing the binary digits of `x`.
   - It iterates from `i = 0` to `29` and checks if the `i-th` bit of `x` is set (`x & pow(2, i)`).
   - If the bit is set, it appends `'1'` to the list; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Modifying the List to Meet Constraints:**
   - The program initializes a flag `flag` to handle the constraint that no two consecutive non-zero elements should appear.
   - It iterates through the list `s` and modifies it to ensure the constraint is met:
     - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it changes the current element to `'1'` and resets the flag.
     - If `flag` is not set and the current element and the next element are both `'1'`, it changes the current element to `'-'` and sets the flag.
     - If `flag` is set, it changes the current element to `'0'`.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it does nothing.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After the loop, if the last element is `'0'` and the flag is still set, it changes the last element to `'1'`.
   - If the flag is still set, it adds a new element `'1'` at the end and increments the length.

5. **Printing Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the modified list `s`.
   - It then prints the elements of the list `s` separated by spaces.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Length Constraint:** The program ensures that the length of the list `s` is between 1 and 32.
- **Element Values:** The program correctly handles the values of the elements as `1`, `0`, or `-1`.
- **Summation Condition:** The program constructs the list `s` such that the sum of the elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 equals `x`.
- **No Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:** The program ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements appear in the list `s`.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to generate an array that meets all the specified constraints and conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
