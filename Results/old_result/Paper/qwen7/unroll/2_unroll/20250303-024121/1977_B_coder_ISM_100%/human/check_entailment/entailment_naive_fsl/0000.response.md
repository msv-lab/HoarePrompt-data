Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate an array that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\).

Let's consider the following test case:
- Input: `x = 14`

The expected output for this case would be:
```
5
0 -1 0 0 1
```

However, the program generates:
```
5
0 0 0 -1 1
```

This output is incorrect because it violates the condition that there should not be consecutive non-zero elements. In the generated array `[0, 0, 0, -1, 1]`, the indices `3` and `4` have `-1` and `1` respectively, which are consecutive non-zero elements.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after setting `s[i]` to `'1'` or `'0'`, it checks and adjusts the subsequent elements to avoid having consecutive non-zero elements.
