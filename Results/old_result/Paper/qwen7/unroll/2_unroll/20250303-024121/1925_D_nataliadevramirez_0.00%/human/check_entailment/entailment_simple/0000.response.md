Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - For each pair of friends, the friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion it is chosen. 
   - The expected value for each pair of friends being chosen at least once over \( k \) excursions is \( k \).
   - The formula used in the function is \( f \times \binom{k}{2} \), which correctly accounts for the expected increase in friendship value due to the number of times the pair is chosen.
   - The function returns the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads the number of children \( n \), pairs of friends \( m \), and excursions \( k \).
   - It then reads the list of friendships and calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case.
   - The results are printed out correctly.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs and calling the appropriate functions.
   - The logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values is sound and follows the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
