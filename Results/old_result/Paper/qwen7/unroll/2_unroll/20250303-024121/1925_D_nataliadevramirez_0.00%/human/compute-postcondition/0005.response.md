Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of children), `m` (an integer representing the number of pairs of friends), `k` (an integer representing the number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value). The function returns the sum of the friendship values multiplied by the combination of `k` taken 2, modulo `MOD`, for all `m` pairs of friends.**
