State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer representing the number of children, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions, and `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively.**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not require adjustment.
- The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.
