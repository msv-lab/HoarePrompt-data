Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - It iterates through each friendship and adds the friendship value multiplied by the combination of `k` taken 2 (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) to the result.
   - The result is then taken modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, pairs of friends `m`, and excursions `k`.
   - It then reads the friendship details and passes them to `func_1`.
   - The result from `func_1` is printed for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program structure is correct and follows the problem description.
   - The logic in both functions is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
