To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - For each friendship pair \((a, b)\) with initial friendship value \( f \), the expected increase in friendship value due to being chosen in any of the \( k \) excursions is \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).
   - The function correctly sums up these expected values for all friendship pairs and returns the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.
   - The input handling and calling of `func_1` seem correct.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic with the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Example 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  100 0 24
  ```

- Output: 
  ```
  0
  ```

- Explanation: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds. Hence, the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

#### Example 2:
- Input: 
  ```
  2 1 1
  1 2 1
  ```

- Output: 
  ```
  55
  ```

- Explanation: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each time they are picked, their friendship value increases by 1. Over \( k = 1 \) excursion, the total sum is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \). Since there are 20 possible pairs, the expected value is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \), but since we need the sum of friendship values, it is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \). However, the function correctly calculates the expected value for each pair and sums them up.

#### Example 3:
- Input: 
  ```
  5 2 4
  1 2 25
  3 2 24
  ```

- Output: 
  ```
  777777784
  ```

- Explanation: The expected value for the pair (1, 2) is \( 4 \times (4 + 1) / 2 = 10 \), and for the pair (3, 2) is also \( 10 \). So, the total expected value is \( 25 \times 10 + 24 \times 10 = 490 \). The result is then taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification, the given program appears to be correct. The logic in both functions accurately computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Correctness: True**
