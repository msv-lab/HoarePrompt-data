State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer**, `_` is not a variable but a placeholder, so it doesn't need adjustment. The loop can execute if `w` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0**
