You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. For each test case, it counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times and prints this count. The function ultimately outputs the total count of such unique stick lengths across all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks.
   - It then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is used to store unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`).
   - If so, it increments the counter `shapes` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all unique stick lengths, it prints the value of `shapes`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that processes each test case separately.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary.

3. **Identifying Unique Stick Lengths:**
   - The program correctly identifies unique stick lengths using a list `pl`.

4. **Checking for Valid Polygons:**
   - The program correctly checks if there are at least 3 sticks of a given length to form a polygon.
   - However, the logic for counting polygons is flawed. The program should check how many complete polygons can be formed, not just if there are at least 3 sticks of a given length.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the correct number of polygons that can be formed.

### Example Analysis

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: Only one stick, so no polygon can be formed.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2 1 1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: Two sticks of length 1, so no polygon can be formed.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `6 2 2 3 3 3 3`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Four sticks of length 3 can form one square.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `9 4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Two sets of four sticks of length 2 can form one square, and four sticks of length 4 can form one square.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of polygons that can be formed. It simply checks if there are at least 3 sticks of a given length, which is not sufficient. The correct approach would involve finding the minimum number of complete polygons that can be formed with the available sticks.
