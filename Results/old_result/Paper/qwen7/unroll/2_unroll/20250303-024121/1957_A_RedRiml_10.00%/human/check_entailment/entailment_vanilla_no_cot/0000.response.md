Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only counts the number of polygons that can be formed based on the number of sides (sticks) available, without considering the maximum number of polygons that can be formed simultaneously.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The program counts the number of unique stick lengths (`pl`) and checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length to form a triangle.
- This approach fails to consider the possibility of forming multiple polygons with different numbers of sides using the same set of sticks.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Group the sticks by their lengths.
2. Determine the minimum number of sticks required to form polygons of different sizes (3 for triangles, 4 for quadrilaterals, etc.).
3. Calculate how many complete polygons of each size can be formed.
4. Sum up the number of polygons that can be formed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        stick_counts = {}
        for stick in palka:
            if stick in stick_counts:
                stick_counts[stick] += 1
            else:
                stick_counts[stick] = 1
        
        polygons = 0
        while len(stick_counts) > 0:
            min_sticks_needed = float('inf')
            for length, count in stick_counts.items():
                min_sticks_needed = min(min_sticks_needed, count // 3)
            
            if min_sticks_needed == 0:
                break
            
            polygons += min_sticks_needed
            for _ in range(min_sticks_needed):
                for length in stick_counts.keys():
                    stick_counts[length] -= 3
                    if stick_counts[length] == 0:
                        del stick_counts[length]
        
        print(polygons)

func()
```

This corrected program will properly calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed simultaneously.
