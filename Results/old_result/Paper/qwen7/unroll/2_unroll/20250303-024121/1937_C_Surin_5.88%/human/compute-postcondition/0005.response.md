Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes variables t, n, and p internally, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^3, n is an integer between 2 and 10^4, and p is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function returns a value based on these variables.**

This means the function does not take any external parameters but uses predefined variables `t`, `n`, and `p` within its scope. It processes these variables according to their defined constraints and returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, and `p`.
