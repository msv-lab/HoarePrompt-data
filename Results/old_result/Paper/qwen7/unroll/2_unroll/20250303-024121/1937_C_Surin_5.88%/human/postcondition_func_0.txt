The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates through indices from 1 to n-1. It compares the value at index `v1` with the value at each index `i` and updates `v1` and another variable `prev` based on the comparison results. After completing the comparisons, it outputs the value of `prev`, which is the smallest index `i` (1 ≤ i < n) where the value at that index is greater than the value at `v1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
