Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries.
2. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by comparing values at different indices using bitwise OR operations.
3. However, the logic in the program does not correctly implement the strategy needed to maximize the XOR operation. Specifically:
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0 and then iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\), comparing the value at `v1` with the value at each index `i`.
   - It updates `v1` based on the comparison results, but this approach does not ensure that the final `v1` and `prev` values correspond to indices that maximize the XOR operation.
   - The program then outputs `prev` and `v1` as the indices that maximize the XOR, which is not necessarily true based on the logic implemented.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the required strategy to find the indices that maximize the XOR operation.

Correctness: **False**
