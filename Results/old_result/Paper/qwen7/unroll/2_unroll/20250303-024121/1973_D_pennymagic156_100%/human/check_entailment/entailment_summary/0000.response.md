Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and behavior of `func_5` step-by-step based on the problem description and the provided execution summaries.

1. **Initialization and Querying for Maximum Possible Values of \( v \):**
   - The function starts by initializing `v` to 1.
   - It then iterates from `n` down to 1, querying the smallest `r` such that \( f(1, r) = i \times n \) for each `i` from `n` down to 1.
   - If `v` equals `n`, it breaks the loop and sets `v` to the current value of `i`.
   - This part ensures that `v` is set to the maximum possible value of \( m \) that could be achieved under the constraints.

2. **Splitting the Array into Subarrays:**
   - After determining the initial value of `v`, the function enters another loop that iterates from 1 to `n // k`.
   - For each iteration, it attempts to find a subarray starting at position `l` such that \( f(l, r) = i \times v \).
   - It uses `func_2()` to get the smallest `r` such that \( f(l, r) = i \times v \).
   - If it successfully finds such a subarray for all required positions without exceeding the bounds, it prints the final result and returns.
   - If no such subarray can be found, it prints `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints Handling:**
   - The function handles the edge case where no valid subarray can be found by printing `-1`.
   - It ensures that the queries are within the constraints and handles invalid queries gracefully.

Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_5` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It properly queries for the necessary values and checks the conditions to determine the largest possible value of \( m \).

Correctness: **True**
