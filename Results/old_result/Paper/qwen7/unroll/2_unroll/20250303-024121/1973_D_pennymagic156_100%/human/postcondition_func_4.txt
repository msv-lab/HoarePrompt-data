The function accepts no parameters and returns None. It first initializes variables `n` and `k` using the result of `func_3()`. It then iterates from `n` down to 1, updating `v` based on the result of `func_2()`. If `v` equals `n`, it breaks the loop and sets `v` to the current value of `i`. Next, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to `n // k`, performing a series of operations involving `func_2()` and printing results. If certain conditions are met, it prints a final result and returns. If no conditions are met, it prints '! -1' and returns.
