Output State: **v is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n/2, n is the return value of func_3(), k is the return value of func_3(), i is the last iteration value of the for loop, cnt is 0, l is n + 1.**

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, but since no specific code is provided for `func_2()`, it does not modify the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `v`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `cnt`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only thing we know for sure is that `i` is set to the last value it took during the loop's execution, which is `n // k`. The values of `cnt` and `l` are reset to 0 and `n + 1` respectively, and the corresponding print statement `! {i * v}` is executed, but this does not affect the values of the variables. Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
