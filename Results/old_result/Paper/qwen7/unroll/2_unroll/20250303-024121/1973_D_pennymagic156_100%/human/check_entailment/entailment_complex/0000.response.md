### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem.

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.
   - `func_2()` reads an integer input from the user.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input and splits it into a tuple of integers.
   - `func_4()` reads a line of input and returns it as a string.
   - `func_5()` is the main function that implements the logic to solve the problem.

2. **Main Function (`func_5()`):**
   - The function starts by calling `func_3()` to get the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward from `n` to 1, querying the function to find the smallest `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`.
   - Once `v` is determined, it enters another loop that tries to split the array into `k` subarrays such that each subarray has the product of its length and its maximum equal to `v`.
   - For each potential starting index `l` in the range from 1 to `n // k + 1`, it queries the function to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - If it successfully finds such subarrays without breaking the condition, it prints the result `i * v` and exits.
   - If no such subarrays are found, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis:

1. **Querying and Validation:**
   - The function correctly uses the provided `func_2()` to validate the results of its queries.
   - The logic for determining `v` and splitting the array into subarrays is sound and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where no valid subarrays can be formed by printing `-1` at the end.
   - The loop structure ensures that the function checks all possible subarray splits before concluding that no valid split exists.

3. **Interaction Protocol:**
   - The function adheres to the interaction protocol by printing queries in the required format and flushing the output.
   - It correctly handles the termination condition by checking the response from the server.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It adheres to the interaction protocol and handles all necessary cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
