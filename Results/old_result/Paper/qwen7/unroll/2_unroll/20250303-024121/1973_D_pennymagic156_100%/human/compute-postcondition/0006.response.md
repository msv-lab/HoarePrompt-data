Output State: v is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n/2, n is the return value of func_3(), k is the return value of func_3(), i is the last iteration value of the for loop, cnt is 0, l is n + 1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to the last value it took during the loop's execution, which is `n // k`. The variables `cnt` and `l` inside the inner while loop are reset to 0 and n+1 respectively when the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` is met, and the corresponding print statement `! {i * v}` is executed. This means that after the loop finishes, `cnt` will be 0 and `l` will be n + 1, and the loop will exit. The values of `v`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
