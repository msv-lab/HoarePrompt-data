Based on the initial state provided:

- `v` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n/2`.
- `n` is the return value of `func_3()`.
- `k` is the return value of `func_3()`.
- `i` is the last iteration value of the for loop, which is `n // k`.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `n + 1`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

This statement directly prints the string `! -1`. Since no variables are being referenced in this print statement, the values of `v`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `cnt`, and `l` do not affect the output.

Output: **! -1**
