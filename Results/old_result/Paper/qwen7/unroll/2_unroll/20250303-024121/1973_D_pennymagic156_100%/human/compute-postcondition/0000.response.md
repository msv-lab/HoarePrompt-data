Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_3()`, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since the exact implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, we can only state that `n` and `k` are the return values from this function call. The initial conditions that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4` remain valid post-execution.
