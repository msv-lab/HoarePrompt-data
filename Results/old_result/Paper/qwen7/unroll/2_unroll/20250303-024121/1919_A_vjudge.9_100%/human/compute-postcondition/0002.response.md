Output State: The output state will consist of "Bob" or "Alice" printed for each iteration based on the condition provided in the loop. Specifically, "Bob" will be printed if the absolute difference between the two integers entered in each iteration is even, and "Alice" will be printed if the absolute difference is odd. The exact sequence of "Bob" and "Alice" depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
