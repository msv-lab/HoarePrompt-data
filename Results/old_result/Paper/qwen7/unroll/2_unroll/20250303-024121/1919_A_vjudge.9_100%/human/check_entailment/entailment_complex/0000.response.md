Reasoning:
The provided solution checks whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for the game described. Here’s why:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The key observation is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If the difference is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he wins.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring she wins.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The code correctly takes the absolute difference between `a` and `b` using `abs(a - b)`.
   - It then checks if this difference is even or odd using the modulus operator `% 2`.
   - Based on the result, it prints "Bob" or "Alice".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles all given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).
   - The logic is consistent across all test cases provided in the example.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is correct and matches the optimal strategy for the game.

Correctness: **True**
