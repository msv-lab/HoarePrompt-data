State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
3. Since `t` is the only variable that determines whether the loop will execute, it must be within the specified range (1 to 1000).
4. The variable `i` must be set to its initial value, which is 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` must be 0.
