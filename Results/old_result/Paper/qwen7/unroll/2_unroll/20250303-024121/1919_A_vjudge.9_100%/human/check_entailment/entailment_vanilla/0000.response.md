### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them, but after choosing, they must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If `a` and `b` are equal, the player whose turn it is will lose because they will always end up swapping back to the same state, and eventually, they will be forced to swap when one of their wallets is empty.
   - If `a` and `b` are not equal, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position by ensuring that the difference between `a` and `b` remains odd. This is because the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference changes with each move, and the player can always make the difference odd again after the opponent's move.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even using `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.
   - If the difference is even, it means `a` and `b` are equal or differ by an even number, which means the player whose turn it is will eventually lose if both play optimally.
   - If the difference is odd, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
