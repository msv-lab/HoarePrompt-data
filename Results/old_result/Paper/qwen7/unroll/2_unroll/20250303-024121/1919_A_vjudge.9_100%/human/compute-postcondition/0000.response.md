Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables (like `a` and `b`) are not mentioned in the code and thus remain in their initial state, which is not specified but implied to be undefined or not yet assigned.
