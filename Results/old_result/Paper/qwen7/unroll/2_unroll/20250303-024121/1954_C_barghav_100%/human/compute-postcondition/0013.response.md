Functionality: **The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as inputs, each representing an integer of the same length. It then compares each corresponding pair of characters from these strings. If a character in `x` is less than the corresponding character in `y`, they are swapped. This process continues for all pairs of characters. After processing, the function prints the modified string `x` followed by an empty line and then the original string `y` with each character separated by a space. The function does not return any value.**
