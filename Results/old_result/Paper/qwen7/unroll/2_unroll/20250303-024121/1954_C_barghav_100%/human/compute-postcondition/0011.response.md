Based on the initial state described, the variable `b` is printed as a string with each character separated by a space. However, the initial state does not specify the actual value of `b`. Since no specific value is given for `b`, we cannot determine the exact printed output.

Given this, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **a string representation of `b` where each character is separated by a space**
