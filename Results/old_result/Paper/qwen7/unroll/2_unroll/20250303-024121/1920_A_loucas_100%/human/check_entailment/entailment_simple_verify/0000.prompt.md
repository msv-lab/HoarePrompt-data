You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop. The final value of `num` after all iterations is printed, which represents the count of numbers in the `no` list that fall within the range between `max(big)` and `min(less)`, adjusted for any overlaps.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints involving the "not equal to" condition (type 3). Specifically, the program calculates the range of valid `k` values by finding the difference between the minimum value in the `less` list and the maximum value in the `big` list. However, this approach does not account for the fact that `k` cannot be equal to any of the values in the `no` list.

For example, consider the following input:
- Test case with 6 constraints:
  ```
  6
  1 5
  2 10
  3 2
  3 8
  3 6
  3 9
  ```

According to the problem description, `k` must be greater than or equal to 5 (`k ≥ 5`), less than or equal to 10 (`k ≤ 10`), and not equal to 2, 8, 6, and 9. The valid range of `k` values would be from 5 to 10, excluding 2, 8, 6, and 9. Therefore, the valid values of `k` are 5, 7, and 10, making the total count 3.

However, the program calculates the range as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, which gives `10 - 5 + 1 = 6`. Then it subtracts the count of values in the `no` list that fall within this range, but it does not correctly adjust the range to exclude these values. This leads to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to properly exclude the values in the `no` list from the calculated range.
