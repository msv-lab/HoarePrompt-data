The function processes a series of constraints defined by the number of test cases and their respective conditions. For each test case, it categorizes integers into three lists based on their types (big, less, and no). It then calculates the count of integers in the 'no' list that fall within the range between the maximum value in the 'big' list and the minimum value in the 'less' list, adjusting for any overlaps. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.
