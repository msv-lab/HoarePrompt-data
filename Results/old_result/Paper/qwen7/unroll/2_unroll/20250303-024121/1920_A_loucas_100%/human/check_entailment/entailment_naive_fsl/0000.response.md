Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints involving the "not equal to" condition (type 3). Specifically, the program calculates the range of valid `k` values by finding the difference between the minimum value in the `less` list and the maximum value in the `big` list. However, this approach does not account for the fact that `k` cannot be equal to any of the values in the `no` list.

For example, consider the following input:
- Test case with 6 constraints:
  ```
  6
  1 5
  2 10
  3 2
  3 8
  3 6
  3 9
  ```

According to the problem description, `k` must be greater than or equal to 5 (`k ≥ 5`), less than or equal to 10 (`k ≤ 10`), and not equal to 2, 8, 6, and 9. The valid range of `k` values would be from 5 to 10, excluding 2, 8, 6, and 9. Therefore, the valid values of `k` are 5, 7, and 10, making the total count 3.

However, the program calculates the range as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, which gives `10 - 5 + 1 = 6`. Then it subtracts the count of values in the `no` list that fall within this range, but it does not correctly adjust the range to exclude these values. This leads to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to properly exclude the values in the `no` list from the calculated range.
