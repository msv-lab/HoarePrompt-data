Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of constraints defined by the problem statement. It returns a value based on the constraints provided, which include integers a and x where a is either 1 or 2 and x ranges from 1 to 10^9. The function evaluates these constraints to produce an output, though the specific nature of the output is not detailed here.**
