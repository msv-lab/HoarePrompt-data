Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Storing Constraints**: For each test case, it reads the number of constraints and stores them in lists `big`, `less`, and `no` based on their types (greater than or equal, less than or equal, and not equal).
3. **Initial Range Calculation**: It calculates the initial range of possible values for `k` by finding the difference between the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`. This gives an initial count of potential values for `k`.
4. **Adjusting for 'Not Equal' Constraints**: It then iterates through the `no` list and subtracts 1 from the count for each value that falls within the calculated range. This adjusts the count to exclude values that cannot be `k` due to the "not equal" constraints.
5. **Outputting Result**: Finally, it prints the adjusted count.

This approach ensures that all constraints are considered and the correct number of possible values for `k` is computed. Given the problem constraints and the guarantees provided (such as the existence of at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2), the program handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
