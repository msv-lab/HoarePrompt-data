The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( ans \) using a specific formula involving \( n \) and \( b \) (where \( b \) ranges from 2 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \)). The function then prints the calculated \( ans \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
