Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and the input conversion ensures it remains within this range, the updated state reflects that `t` is now the input integer, still adhering to the original constraints.
