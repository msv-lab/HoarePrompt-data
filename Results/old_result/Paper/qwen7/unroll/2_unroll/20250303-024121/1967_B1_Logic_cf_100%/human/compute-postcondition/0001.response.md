State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, T is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `T` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. The loop condition `range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
4. Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure it meets these conditions.
5. The initial value of `T` is set to 0, which is correct for the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the conditions under which the loop will execute, ensuring `t` is within the specified range and `T` is correctly initialized.
