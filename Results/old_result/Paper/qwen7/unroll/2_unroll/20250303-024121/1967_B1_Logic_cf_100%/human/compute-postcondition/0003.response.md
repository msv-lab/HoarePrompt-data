Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. The function validates that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, ensuring the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. For each valid test case, the function performs unspecified operations (not detailed here) and returns the results accordingly.**
