Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read and split into separate integers.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs where \(a = n\) and \(b \leq m\).

3. **Loop Through Possible Values of \(b\):**
   - The loop runs from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
   - For each value of `b`, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is added to `ans`.

### Checking the Logic

#### Condition Analysis
The condition to check for valid pairs \((a, b)\) is:
\[ a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

However, the provided code does not actually check this condition. Instead, it simply adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to the answer for each \(b\). This does not seem to correctly implement the required logic.

#### Example Verification
Let's verify with the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:** \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - The code calculates \(ans = 1\) (correct).
- **Test Case 2:** \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
  - The code calculates \(ans = 3\) (incorrect, should be 3 pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)).
- **Test Case 3:** \(n = 3\), \(m = 5\)
  - The code calculates \(ans = 4\) (incorrect, should be 4 pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1)).

From these examples, it is clear that the logic in the provided code does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

**Correctness: False**
