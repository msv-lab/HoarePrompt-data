Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head; it is set to 0 by default when the loop starts.
   - `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified in the given state.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `i` starts at 0 by default, we don't need to adjust it. However, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**
