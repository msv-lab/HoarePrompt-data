Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2.
   - If `t` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and incremented by 1. This effectively calculates the number of full 2x2 grids needed plus any additional space required.

3. **Space Calculation for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate the remaining space available after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), then no additional screens are needed beyond what was calculated for `t`.
   - Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons need to be placed. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `t2 // 15 + 1` if there is any remainder (`t2 % 15 != 0`).

4. **Output:**
   - The final number of screens required is printed.

### Detailed Example Analysis:

Let's take the example from the problem statement and verify the logic:

- For the first test case: `1 1`
  - `t = 1`, which is odd, so `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `1`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- For the second test case: `7 2`
  - `t = 2`, which is even, so `t = 2 // 2 = 1`.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, which is less than `7`, so we need additional screens.
  - Remaining icons: `7 - 7 = 0`, which means no more screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- For the third test case: `12 4`
  - `t = 4`, which is even, so `t = 4 // 2 = 2`.
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`, which is greater than `12`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2`

- For the fourth test case: `0 3`
  - `t = 3`, which is odd, so `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`.
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`, which is greater than `0`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2`

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program and the examples, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required based on the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
