Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers between 0 and 99, and it returns different values based on the input pairs (x, y).**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters when called but is expected to handle multiple test cases internally, each consisting of two integers x and y within specified ranges. The function processes these test cases and returns outputs based on the values of x and y for each case.
