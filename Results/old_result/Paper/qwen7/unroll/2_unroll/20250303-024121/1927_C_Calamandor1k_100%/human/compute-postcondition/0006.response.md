Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific constraints, and two lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, the function processes `a` and `b` to find unique elements within the range up to `k`, identifies elements exclusive to `a` or `b`, and those common to both. It then checks if the number of exclusive elements in `a` or `b` exceeds `k // 2`, or if the total number of distinct elements is less than `k`. If any of these conditions are met, it appends 'NO' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'YES'. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on these conditions.**
