Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', based on the conditions specified in the loop body for each test case. Specifically, for each test case defined by the input, the program checks the positions of points (xa, ya) and (xb, yb) on a grid of size h x w, and prints 'Draw' if xa > xb, otherwise it calculates the horizontal distance between the two points and determines whether Alice or Bob can win based on their vertical positions relative to the midpoint of the horizontal distance.
