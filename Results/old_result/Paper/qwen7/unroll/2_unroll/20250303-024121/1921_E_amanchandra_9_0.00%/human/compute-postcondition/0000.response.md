Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop condition `i < int(input())`.
   - The input function `int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We know that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The loop will run for each test case, so `i` will take values from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value that is equal to `t`, the number of test cases.
   - Therefore, the initial state should ensure that when `int(input())` is called, it returns a value within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute properly.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will run for `t` iterations, as required.
