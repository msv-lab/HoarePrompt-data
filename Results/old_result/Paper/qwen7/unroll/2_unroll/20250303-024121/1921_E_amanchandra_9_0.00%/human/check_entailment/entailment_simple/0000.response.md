### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by determining the winner of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - If `xa > xb`, the code directly prints 'Draw'. This is correct because if Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, Alice cannot capture Bob's chip since she can only move down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left. Thus, the game would end in a draw.

2. **Calculating the Distance**:
   - The variable `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This represents the maximum number of moves Alice can make to potentially capture Bob's chip if `xa < xb`.

3. **Odd vs Even Distance**:
   - If the distance between `xa` and `xb` is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), the code sets the range `[l, r]` based on `yb - x` and `yb + x`.
   - If the distance is even, the code sets the range `[l, r]` based on `ya - x` and `yb + x`.

4. **Checking Capture Conditions**:
   - For an odd distance, the code checks if the vertical position `ya` is within the range `[l, r]` and if the difference in vertical positions is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - For an even distance, the code checks if the vertical position `yb` is within the range `[l, r]` and if the difference in vertical positions is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Output Determination**:
   - If the conditions are met, the code prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' accordingly. If not, it prints 'Draw'.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the logic against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: 
   - Input: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
   - Output: `Alice`
   - Explanation: Alice can move down to (3, 2) and then down-right to (4, 3), capturing Bob's chip at (5, 3).

2. **Test Case 2**: 
   - Input: `4 1 2 1 4 1`
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Explanation: Bob can move up to (3, 1) and then up-right to (2, 1), capturing Alice's chip at (2, 1).

3. **Test Case 3**: 
   - Input: `1 4 1 3 1 1`
   - Output: `Draw`
   - Explanation: Alice is in the last row, so she cannot move further down. Bob is in the first row, so he cannot move further up.

4. **Test Case 4**: 
   - Input: `5 5 1 4 5 2`
   - Output: `Draw`
   - Explanation: Alice and Bob are too far apart vertically, and neither can capture the other.

5. **Test Case 5**: 
   - Input: `4 4 1 1 4 4`
   - Output: `Draw`
   - Explanation: Alice and Bob are in opposite corners and cannot capture each other.

6. **Test Case 6**: 
   - Input: `10 10 1 6 10 8`
   - Output: `Alice`
   - Explanation: Alice can move down to (2, 6) and then down-right to (3, 7), and so on, eventually capturing Bob's chip at (10, 8).

7. **Test Case 7**: 
   - Input: `10 10 2 6 10 7`
   - Output: `Draw`
   - Explanation: Alice and Bob are too far apart horizontally, and neither can capture the other.

8. **Test Case 8**: 
   - Input: `10 10 9 1 8 1`
   - Output: `Draw`
   - Explanation: Alice is in the last row, so she cannot move further down. Bob is in the first row, so he cannot move further up.

9. **Test Case 9**: 
   - Input: `10 10 8 1 10 2`
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Explanation: Bob can move up to (9, 2) and then up-right to (8, 1), capturing Alice's chip at (8, 1).

10. **Test Case 10**: 
    - Input: `10 10 1 1 2 1`
    - Output: `Alice`
    - Explanation: Alice can move down to (2, 1) and then down-right to (3, 2), capturing Bob's chip at (2, 1).

11. **Test Case 11**: 
    - Input: `10 10 1 3 4 1`
    - Output: `Alice`
    - Explanation: Alice can move down to (2, 3) and then down-right to (3, 4), capturing Bob's chip at (4, 1).

12. **Test Case 12**: 
    - Input: `10 10 3 1 1 1`
    - Output: `Alice`
    - Explanation: Alice can move down to (4, 1) and then down-right to (5, 2), and so on, eventually capturing Bob's chip at (3, 1).
