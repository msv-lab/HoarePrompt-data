Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is one more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value, `y2` is the same as the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `y1` is less than `y2`, `a` is `m - y2`.**

Explanation: The code `a = m - y2` assigns the value of `m - y2` to the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` are preserved.
