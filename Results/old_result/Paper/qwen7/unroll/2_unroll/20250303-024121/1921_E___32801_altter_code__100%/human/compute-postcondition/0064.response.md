Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**.

In this output state, the value of `t` is updated to be the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
