Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is now one more than its original value, y1 is one more than the original y1 (which was the fourth element of r), x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, x2 is greater than x1, y2 is greater than y1.**

This means that `x1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
