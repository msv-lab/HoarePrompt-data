Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each part to an integer.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is the third element of `r`.
- `y1` is the fourth element of `r`.
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r`.
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.
- The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`.

The `print` statement is `print('draw')`.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output the string `'draw'`.

Output: **'draw'**
