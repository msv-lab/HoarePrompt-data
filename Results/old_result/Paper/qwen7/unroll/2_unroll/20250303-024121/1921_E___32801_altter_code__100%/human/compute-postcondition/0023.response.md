Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is one more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value, `y2` is the same as the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `a` is `y2 - 1`, and the current value of `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`.**

Explanation: The code `a = y2 - 1` assigns the value of `y2 - 1` to the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The conditions and relationships between the variables `x1`, `y1`, `y2`, and `x2` are preserved.
