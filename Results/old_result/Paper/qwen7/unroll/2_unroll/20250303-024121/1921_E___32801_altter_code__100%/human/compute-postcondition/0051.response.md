Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.
   - `n` is the first element of `r`.
   - `m` is the second element of `r`.
   - `x1` is two more than its original value.
   - `y1` is one less than its original value.
   - `y2` is either 1 or equal to `m`.
   - `x2` is always greater than `x1`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`.
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - `x2` is decreased by `a`.
   - Constraints: `1 <= y1 <= m` and `1 <= x1 <= n`, but `(b // 2 <= a or abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('draw')
   ```

Given the constraints and the code snippet, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
