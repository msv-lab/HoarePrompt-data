Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins. Each test case involves a specific number of coins and their initial orientation ("U" for up, "D" for down).
- `func_1()` correctly reads the input and organizes it into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins and the string representing the initial state of the coins.
- `func_2()` calculates the number of coins facing up ("U"). According to the problem statement, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
- Given the execution summaries, `func_2()` accurately implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of coins facing up.
- Since `func_1()` and `func_2()` together correctly process each test case and determine the winner based on the given rules, the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
