The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if `n` is even or if the count of "U" in the string `s` is greater than the count of "D". If `n` is even, it appends "no" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "yes" if the count of "U" is greater than the count of "D", and "no" otherwise. Finally, it prints the contents of the results list.
