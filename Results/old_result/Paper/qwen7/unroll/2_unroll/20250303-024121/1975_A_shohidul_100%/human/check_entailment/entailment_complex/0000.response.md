Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).

2. **Initial Check**: It first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a generator expression. This is done by checking if every element is less than or equal to the next element. If this condition holds, it prints "YES".

3. **Secondary Check**: If the initial check fails, the program iterates through the array to find a potential split point. For each possible split point, it checks if the suffix (the part after the split point) is non-decreasing and if the first element of the suffix is greater than or equal to the rest of the elements in the suffix. If such a split is found, it prints "YES". If no such split is found after checking all possible points, it prints "NO".

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case directly, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the implementation appears to be correct and aligns with the expected behavior for the given examples and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
