Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Check**: For each test case, it first checks if the entire array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all()` function with the condition `[a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)]`. If this condition holds true, it directly prints 'YES'.
3. **Subsequence Check**: If the array is not sorted, it iterates through the array to find a subsequence where:
   - The subsequence itself is sorted in non-decreasing order (`new_all`).
   - The first element of the subsequence is greater than or equal to all other elements in the subsequence (`check_all_new`).
4. **Decision Making**: If such a subsequence is found, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. If no such subsequence is found after checking all possible splits, it prints 'NO'.

This approach is correct because:
- It correctly identifies if the array is already sorted.
- It checks all possible ways to split the array and verify if the resulting subarray meets the conditions.
- The logic ensures that if any valid split and rearrangement can make the array non-decreasing, it will be identified.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the provided program implements the required functionality accurately.

Correctness: **True**
