You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values of `t`, `n`, and `a` for each iteration of the loop. For each `t` iterations, the program checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing. If it is, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there exists a subsequence starting from any index that is non-decreasing and its first element is greater than or equal to the rest of the elements in the subsequence. If such a subsequence exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
    #
    #Since the exact input values are not provided, the output state cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `t`, `n`, and `a` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it checks if the list \( a \) is non-decreasing. If it is, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there exists a subsequence starting from any index that is non-decreasing and whose first element is greater than or equal to the rest of the elements in the subsequence. If such a subsequence exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Non-Decreasing Check**: It first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing by using `all([a[i-1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because no operation is needed.

3. **Finding the Split Point**: If the array is not non-decreasing, it looks for the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This indicates a potential split point.

4. **Split and Check**: After finding such a split point, it splits the array into two parts: `x` (the prefix from index 0 to `i-1`) and `y` (the suffix from index `i` to the end). It then checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix (`new[0]`).
   - `new_all`: Ensures that the suffix `new` is non-decreasing.

5. **Decision Making**: If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' because the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the two parts. If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies when the array is already non-decreasing.
- It correctly finds the first split point where the array is not non-decreasing.
- It correctly checks if the suffix can be non-decreasing and if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix.
- The logic handles all cases as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

### Correctness:
**True**
