Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of splitting the array in such a way that the resulting array becomes non-decreasing. Let's analyze the given example from the problem statement:

For the input:
```
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
```

The program checks if the array is already non-decreasing:
```
check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
```
This condition returns `False` because `1 1 4 5 1 4` is not non-decreasing.

Next, the program attempts to split the array and check if the resulting array is non-decreasing:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break
```

However, this logic is flawed. The condition `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to each element in the new part of the array, which is not what we need. Instead, we need to check if the new array formed by swapping the parts is non-decreasing.

A correct approach would be to check if the array can be split such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Try to find a valid split
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                left_part = a[:i]
                right_part = a[i:]
                
                # Check if left_part is non-increasing and right_part is non-decreasing
                if all(left_part[j] >= left_part[j + 1] for j in range(len(left_part) - 1)) and \
                   all(right_part[j] <= right_part[j + 1] for j in range(len(right_part) - 1)):
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing, which aligns with the problem description.
