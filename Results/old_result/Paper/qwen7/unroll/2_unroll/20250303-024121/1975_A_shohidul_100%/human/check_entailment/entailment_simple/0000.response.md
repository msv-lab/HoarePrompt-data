Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts of the array. Let's break down the key steps and logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Checking Non-Decreasing Order**: It first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing using `check_all`. If `a` is non-decreasing, it prints "YES".

3. **Finding Possible Swaps**: If `a` is not non-decreasing, it iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. It then considers the subarray starting from this position and checks if it can be swapped with the remaining part of the array to make the entire array non-decreasing.

4. **Validation of Swap**: For each potential split point, it checks if the left part is greater than or equal to the first element of the right part and if the right part is non-decreasing. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES". If no such split point is found, it prints "NO".

Given the logic and the steps, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
