The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it checks if the list \( a \) is non-decreasing. If it is, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there exists a subsequence starting from any index that is non-decreasing and whose first element is greater than or equal to the rest of the elements in the subsequence. If such a subsequence exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
