Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions do not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` do not accurately simulate the game's rules and do not consider the optimal strategies for both players.

1. **Function `zerocnts`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of a number. However, this information is not directly relevant to determining the winner of the game. The game's outcome depends on the total length of the numbers after reversals and concatenations, not just the number of trailing zeros.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to calculate the total length of the numbers after reversals and then determines the winner based on this length. However, it does not correctly simulate the game's turns and does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. The function does not handle the actual game logic of turns and the conditions under which Sasha wins or Anna wins.

Given the complexity of the game and the need to simulate optimal play, the provided functions do not correctly implement the game logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
