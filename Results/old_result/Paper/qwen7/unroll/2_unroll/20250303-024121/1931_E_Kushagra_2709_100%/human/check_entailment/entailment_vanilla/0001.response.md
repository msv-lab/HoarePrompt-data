Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha and Anna play a game with a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of one number in her turn.
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers in his turn.
   - The game ends when only one number remains, and Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\).
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The length of the resulting number after Anna's move is crucial because it determines whether Sasha can form a number of sufficient length in his next move.
   - The function `zerocnts` calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - The function `func_1` seems to be calculating a total length of numbers after some transformations and deciding the winner based on this length.

3. **Analysis of `zerocnts` Function:**
   - This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - It iterates over the string representation of the number from the end to the beginning, counting zeros until a non-zero digit is encountered.

4. **Analysis of `func_1` Function:**
   - `tot` is initialized as the total length of all numbers in the list.
   - `cntvals` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in each number, sorted in descending order.
   - The loop subtracts every other element from `tot` (starting from the largest number of trailing zeros).
   - The decision to return "Sasha" or "Anna" is based on whether `tot` is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\).

### Reasoning:

- The logic in `func_1` is designed to simulate the game's outcome by considering the total length of numbers after Anna's optimal moves.
- By subtracting every other element (starting from the largest number of trailing zeros), the function effectively simulates the process where Anna tries to minimize the total length and Sasha tries to maximize it.
- The condition `tot >= m + 1` checks if the remaining total length of numbers is sufficient for Sasha to form a number of at least \(10^m\).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game under optimal play conditions.

**Correctness: True**
