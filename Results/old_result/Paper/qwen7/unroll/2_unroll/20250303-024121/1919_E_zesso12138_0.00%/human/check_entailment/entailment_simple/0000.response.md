### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of ways to construct an array `a` of size `n` with elements being either 1 or -1, such that the sorted prefix sums match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to achieve the desired prefix sums.
   - The variable `dp` is used to store intermediate results, and `offset` is used to adjust indices for the prefix sums.
   - The function returns `dp[final_sum]`, which should represent the number of valid arrays `a` that produce the given `p`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the reading of input and the processing of each test case.
   - The results are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

3. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `n`, and the sorted prefix sum array `p` for each test case.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, and the program correctly processes the input within the given limits.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` appears to be correct for calculating the number of valid arrays `a` that produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement and handles all the specified constraints and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
