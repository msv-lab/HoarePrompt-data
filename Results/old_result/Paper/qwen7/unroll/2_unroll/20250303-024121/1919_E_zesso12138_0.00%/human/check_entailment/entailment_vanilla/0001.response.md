Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function aims to compute the number of ways to form a sequence \(a\) such that the sorted prefix sums match the given array \(p\).

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized to zero with a length of \(2n + 1\).
   - `offset` is set to \(n\), representing the midpoint where the prefix sums start from.
   - `dp[offset]` is set to 1, indicating one way to start with an empty prefix sum at the midpoint.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - A new DP array `new_dp` is created to store intermediate results.
   - For each position `j` in the DP array, if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, it means there is a way to reach that position.
   - Two transitions are made:
     - `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j]`.
     - `new_dp[j - 1]` is also updated similarly.
   - This effectively simulates adding either a `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, which corresponds to the last element in the sorted prefix sum array plus the midpoint.

#### Function `func_2`
This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Splits the input into tokens.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Iterates over each test case.
   - Extracts `n` and the prefix sum array `p`.
   - Calls `func_1` to get the result for each test case.
   - Appends the result to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - Prints the results for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Problem Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly, including the modulo operation (`998244353`).

2. **Correctness of DP Transition**:
   - The DP transition logic in `func_1` is designed to count the number of valid sequences that can produce the given sorted prefix sums.
   - The transitions correctly account for adding `1` or `-1` to the prefix sums.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic implemented in both functions is consistent with the problem requirements. The dynamic programming approach correctly counts the number of valid sequences for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
