The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer within the range of 1 to 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0. The function then iterates over the range of `n` and updates the `dp` array based on certain conditions. Finally, it calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + n` and returns the value at index `final_sum` in the `dp` array, which is guaranteed to be 0 due to the initialization and update process.
