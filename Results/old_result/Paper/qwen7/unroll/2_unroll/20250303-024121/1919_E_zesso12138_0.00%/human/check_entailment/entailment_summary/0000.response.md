Reasoning:
- The problem requires us to determine the number of possible initial arrays `a` that would result in a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- The solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to construct the original array `a` that would result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

Given the execution summaries:
- `func_1` correctly initializes a DP array and updates it based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
- `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
- The output of `func_2` matches the expected outputs provided in the example.

Since both functions work as intended and produce the correct results based on the problem description, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
