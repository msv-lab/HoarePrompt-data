Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using the split() method.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` (which is the first element of the list `data`) to the variable `t` and increments `index` by 1. The values of `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial state.
