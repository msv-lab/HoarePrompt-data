### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided code step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized to zero with a length of \(2n + 1\). This is correct because we need to cover all possible prefix sums from \(-n\) to \(n\).
   - `offset` is set to \(n\), representing the midpoint where the prefix sums start from. This is correct.
   - `dp[offset]` is set to 1, indicating one way to start with an empty prefix sum at the midpoint. This is correct.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - A new DP array `new_dp` is created to store intermediate results. This is correct.
   - For each position `j` in the DP array, if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, it means there is a way to reach that position. This is correct.
   - Two transitions are made:
     - `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j]`. This is correct because adding 1 to the current prefix sum is a valid move.
     - `new_dp[j - 1]` is also updated similarly. This is correct because subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum is a valid move.
   - This effectively simulates adding either a `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum. However, the critical point here is that the transitions should only be made if the resulting positions are within the bounds of the DP array (i.e., between \(-n\) and \(n\)). The current implementation does not check these bounds, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, which corresponds to the last element in the sorted prefix sum array plus the midpoint. This is correct.

#### Function `func_2`

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`. This is correct.
   - Splits the input into tokens. This is correct.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Iterates over each test case. This is correct.
   - Extracts `n` and the prefix sum array `p`. This is correct.
   - Calls `func_1` to get the result for each test case. This is correct.
   - Appends the result to the `results` list. This is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - Prints the results for each test case. This is correct.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Problem Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly, including the modulo operation (`998244353`).

2. **Correctness of DP Transition**:
   - The DP transition logic in `func_1` is designed to count the number of valid sequences that can produce the given sorted prefix sums.
   - The transitions correctly account for adding `1` or `-1` to the prefix sums, but they do not check if the resulting positions are within the valid range \([-n, n]\). This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

### Conclusion

The original assessment concluded that the logic implemented in both functions is consistent with the problem requirements. However, the DP transition logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle the bounds of the DP array, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the given program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
