Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for counting the number of initial arrays \(a\) that result in the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\). Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s and then sorting them.

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function attempts to simulate the process using dynamic programming. However, the logic inside the function is flawed.
   - The function initializes a DP array `dp` and tries to update it based on the current value of `p`. But the way it updates the DP array does not correctly reflect the possible transitions between prefix sums.
   - The key issue is that the function does not properly handle the transitions between prefix sums that can occur due to the addition of 1s and -1s in the array \(a\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, the implementation of `func_1` itself is incorrect, so the overall solution is flawed.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
-1 0 0
```
- The correct answer should be 2 because the possible arrays \(a\) that can result in the sorted prefix sum array \(p = [-1, 0, 0]\) are \([-1, 1, 0]\) and \([1, -1, 0]\).
- However, the provided program will not correctly compute this, leading to an incorrect result.

Since the program does not correctly simulate the process and fails to produce the correct results for certain inputs, the program is **incorrect**.
