Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigned to overwrite the default input function, allowing for reading all input at once.**

This line of code does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `p`, but it does modify the behavior of the input function to read all input at once from standard input. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged, but the way input is handled changes.
