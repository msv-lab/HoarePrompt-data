You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #The program returns a list called 'results' which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case processed.

The 'beautiful_count' is calculated based on the conditions specified within the nested loop, considering the frequency of numbers with specific modular values relative to 'x' and 'y'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`. According to the problem description, a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if:

- \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
- \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

However, the program attempts to find pairs based on modular arithmetic conditions that do not directly correspond to these requirements. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

But the program outputs:
```
0
```

This discrepancy arises because the program incorrectly calculates the required modular values and does not properly check for the conditions \(a_i + a_j \mod x = 0\) and \(a_i - a_j \mod y = 0\). Therefore, the program does not correctly identify all beautiful pairs, leading to an incorrect result.
