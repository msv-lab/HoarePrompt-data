Output State: `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case processed. Each element in the list corresponds to the output of the `beautiful_count` variable for each iteration of the outer loop. The `beautiful_count` is calculated based on the conditions specified within the nested loop, considering the frequency of numbers with specific modular values relative to `x` and `y`.
