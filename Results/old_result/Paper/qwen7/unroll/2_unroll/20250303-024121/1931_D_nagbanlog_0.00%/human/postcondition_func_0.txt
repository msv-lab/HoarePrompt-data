The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n`, and two other integers `x` and `y`, along with a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of "beautiful pairs" based on specific modular conditions involving `x` and `y`. A "beautiful pair" is defined by the frequency of numbers in the list that meet certain modular criteria. The function returns a list of counts, one for each test case, representing the number of beautiful pairs found.
