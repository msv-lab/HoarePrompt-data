Output State: **`results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions and values of the initial state for `t`, `test_cases`, and their contents remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `results` is now an empty list.
