Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a list of integers `a` with length `n` for each test case, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and each integer in the list `a` is between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not described here as per the instruction to only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
