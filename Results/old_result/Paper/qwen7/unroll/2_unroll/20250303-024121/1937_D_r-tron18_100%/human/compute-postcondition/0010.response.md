Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and its length `n`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` of `n` integers. Each element in `ans` represents the difference between the number of zeros and ones under certain conditions derived from the balance of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The function processes the string `s1` from right to left, updating the counts and lists used for calculations until it reaches the leftmost character. Finally, it prints the list `ans`.**
