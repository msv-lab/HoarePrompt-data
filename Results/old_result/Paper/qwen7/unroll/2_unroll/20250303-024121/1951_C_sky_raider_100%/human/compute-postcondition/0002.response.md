Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. After the loop executes all the iterations, c is an integer representing the sum of the products of the sorted list elements with their respective accumulated values of t, adjusted by the minimum of m and k for each element.
