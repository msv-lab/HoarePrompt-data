Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a` of ticket prices.
2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted, which is necessary for the algorithm to work as intended.
3. **Initialization**: Variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized appropriately.
4. **Main Loop**: The main loop iterates through the sorted list `a`. For each element, it calculates the number of tickets to buy (`s`), updates the cumulative sum (`c`), adjusts the total tickets bought (`t`), and reduces the remaining tickets to buy (`k`).
5. **Output**: The final cumulative sum `c` is printed for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program follows the rules of the problem: it sorts the ticket prices, buys the minimum of `m` and `k` tickets each day, and adjusts the price accordingly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
