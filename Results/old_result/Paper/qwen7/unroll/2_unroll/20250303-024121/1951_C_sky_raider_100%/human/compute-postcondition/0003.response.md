Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t`, and for each `t` test cases, it takes integers `n`, `m`, and `k` along with a list `a` of `n` integers. It does not return any value directly but processes the given data according to specified conditions.**
