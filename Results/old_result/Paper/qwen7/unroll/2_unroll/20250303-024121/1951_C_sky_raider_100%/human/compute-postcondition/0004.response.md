Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers, then iterates through the list, calculating a cumulative sum based on the minimum of \( m \) and \( k \) for each element. This cumulative sum is adjusted by adding the current value of \( t \) and multiplied by the sorted list element. Finally, it prints the total sum for each test case.**
