Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized by the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the value obtained from `int(input())`. This means `i` will increment from 0 up to but not including the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Initially, `i` is set to 0.

4. **Determine the Value of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is determined by the user input, which is not specified in the initial state. However, we know that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, where `t` is the integer obtained from `int(input())`.

Given these points, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i`, which should be set to 0, and `t` (the value of `int(input())`) should be within the range `[1, 10^4]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
