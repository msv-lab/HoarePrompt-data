Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins.
2. The provided solution reads all input at once and processes each test case individually.
3. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of coins facing up (`'U'`).
4. The logic in `func_1` is correct:
   - If the number of coins facing up (`num_up`) is odd, Alice can always force a win by making optimal moves.
   - If the number of coins facing up is even, Bob can always force a win by making optimal moves.
5. The function returns `'YES'` if `num_up` is odd and `'NO'` if `num_up` is even, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given the above points, the provided code accurately implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of coins.

Correctness: **True**
