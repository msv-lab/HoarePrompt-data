The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of "U" and "D" characters, representing coins facing up and down respectively. It checks whether it is possible to flip some of the coins so that all coins face up ("U"). If such a configuration is possible, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
