Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` simply checks if the number of coins facing up (`'U'`) is odd or even, which does not take into account the actual game rules and the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

To correctly determine the winner, the program needs to simulate the game or use a more complex logic to evaluate the initial state of the coins and the possible moves. The current implementation is overly simplistic and does not reflect the game's dynamics accurately.
