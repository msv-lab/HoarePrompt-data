### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the original program and the provided function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Original Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of each grid `n`.
2. **Row-wise Check**: The program iterates over each row and checks if it contains exactly one '1'. If so, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
3. **Default Output**: If no row contains exactly one '1', the program sets `b` to 'SQUARE' and prints it.

However, as mentioned in the original assessment, this approach is flawed:
- **Triangle Identification**: The program assumes that if any row has exactly one '1', the entire shape must be a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1'.
- **Square Identification**: The program defaults to 'SQUARE' if no row has exactly one '1'. This is also incorrect because the grid could still contain a triangle.

#### Correct Approach:
The original assessment suggests a corrected version of the program that checks for both triangle and square conditions properly. Let's verify this:

1. **Triangle Check**: The program should iterate through possible triangle sizes and check if the grid matches the triangle pattern.
2. **Square Check**: Similarly, the program should iterate through possible square sizes and check if the grid matches the square pattern.

The corrected version provided in the original assessment seems to handle these checks correctly:
- **Triangle Check**: It iterates over possible triangle sizes and checks if each row fits the triangle pattern.
- **Square Check**: It iterates over possible square sizes and checks if each row fits the square pattern.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed fails to correctly identify triangles and squares, and the corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the provided corrected version of the program correctly identifies both triangles and squares according to the problem description.
