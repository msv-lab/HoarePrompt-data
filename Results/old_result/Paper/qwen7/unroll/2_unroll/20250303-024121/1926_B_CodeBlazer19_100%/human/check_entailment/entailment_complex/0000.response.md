Reasoning:

1. The problem requires identifying whether a given grid contains a triangle or a square made up of '1's.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by iterating through each row of the grid.
3. The logic in the code is flawed:
   - `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if any row has exactly one '1'.
   - `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any row has more than one '1'.
   - However, the code only checks one row per grid, which is insufficient to determine the shape of the entire grid.
   - The code should check all rows to ensure the entire grid matches the criteria for a triangle or a square.
4. The code does not correctly handle the conditions for a triangle or a square:
   - For a triangle, it needs to check if the '1's form a pattern where each row has an increasing number of '1's centered in one column.
   - For a square, it needs to check if the '1's form a pattern where each row has the same number of '1's evenly spaced.
5. The current implementation will incorrectly identify a grid as a triangle if any row has exactly one '1', even if the rest of the grid does not form a triangle.
6. The current implementation will incorrectly identify a grid as a square if any row has more than one '1', even if the rest of the grid forms a square.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly identify the shapes in the grid.

Correctness: **False**
