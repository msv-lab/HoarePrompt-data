Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings. Each string contains n characters ('0' or '1') and the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's. The function returns whether the shape found is a triangle or a square.**

This means the function takes a grid (a list of strings where each string represents a row of the grid) as an implicit input through its structure, identifies if the shape formed by '1's is a triangle or a square, and returns which shape it is.
