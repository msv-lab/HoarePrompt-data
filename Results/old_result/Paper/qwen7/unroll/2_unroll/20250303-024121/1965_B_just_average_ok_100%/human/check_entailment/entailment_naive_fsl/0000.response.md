Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not guarantee that there will be no subsequence with a sum equal to `k`. In the provided solution, the program constructs a list of powers of 2, which ensures that all sums from 1 to \(2^{21}-1\) can be formed using subsequences. However, it then adds `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, which might introduce a subsequence sum equal to `k`.

For example, consider the case where \(n = 8\) and \(k = 8\):

- The constructed list `nums` will be `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824]`.
- After appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the list becomes `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824, 8, 9, 16]`.

In this case, the subsequence `[8, 8]` sums to `8`, which is `k`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement that there should be no subsequence with a sum equal to `k`.
