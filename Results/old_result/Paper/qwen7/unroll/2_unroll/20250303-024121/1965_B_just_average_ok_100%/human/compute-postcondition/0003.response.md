Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases where each test case includes three integers: t, n, and k. It processes these test cases under the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 10^7) and returns a result based on these inputs.**

Note: The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the input constraints and implied processing of the test cases.
