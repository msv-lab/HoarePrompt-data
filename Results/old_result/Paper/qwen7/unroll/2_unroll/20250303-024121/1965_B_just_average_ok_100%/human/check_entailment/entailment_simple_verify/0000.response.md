### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Construction of the List `nums`**:
   - `nums` is initialized as a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
   - The variable `idx` is set to `-1` initially.
   - A loop finds the index `idx` of the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`.
   - If `nums[i] > k`, `idx` is updated to `i - 1`.
   - The list `nums` is then modified by appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - The length of the modified `nums` list is printed.
   - The elements of the modified `nums` list are printed.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program:

- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
  - The initial list `nums` contains powers of 2, which means any subsequence sum is a sum of distinct powers of 2.
  - Adding `k - nums[idx]` ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed because `k - nums[idx]` would have to be part of a subsequence, but `nums[idx]` is already in the list, making the sum `k` impossible.
  - Similarly, adding `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k` because these values are larger and do not contribute to forming `k`.

- **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
  - The list `nums` includes all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), which allows forming all sums from 1 to \(2^{21} - 1\).
  - By removing `1 << idx`, we ensure that the sum `k` is not possible.
  - Adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` further ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly constructs a list that meets the requirements of the problem statement. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` to be formed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate. The program does indeed meet the requirements of the problem statement.
