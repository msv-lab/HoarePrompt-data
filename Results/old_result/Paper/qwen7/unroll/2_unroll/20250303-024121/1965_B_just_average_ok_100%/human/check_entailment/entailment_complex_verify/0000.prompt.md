You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1

    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

    #State: Output State: The number of elements in the list `nums` after processing each test case, followed by the elements themselves. The list `nums` will contain up to 23 unique integers for each test case, which are derived from the value of `k` and some powers of 2. Specifically, the list will include the following elements: \(2^{0}\) to \(2^{20}\), the value of `k`, `k-2^idx`, `k+1`, and `k+2^idx+1`, where `idx` is the index just before the first power of 2 greater than `k`. The exact elements and their count depend on the specific values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it generates a list `nums` containing up to 23 unique integers derived from \(k\) and some powers of 2. Specifically, the list includes the values \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), the value of \(k\), \(k - 2^{idx}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{idx} + 1\), where \(idx\) is the index just before the first power of 2 greater than \(k\). The function then prints the number of elements in `nums` followed by the elements themselves.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not guarantee that there will be no subsequence with a sum equal to `k`. In the provided solution, the program constructs a list of powers of 2, which ensures that all sums from 1 to \(2^{21}-1\) can be formed using subsequences. However, it then adds `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, which might introduce a subsequence sum equal to `k`.

For example, consider the case where \(n = 8\) and \(k = 8\):

- The constructed list `nums` will be `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824]`.
- After appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the list becomes `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824, 8, 9, 16]`.

In this case, the subsequence `[8, 8]` sums to `8`, which is `k`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement that there should be no subsequence with a sum equal to `k`.
