Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating a sequence `nums` using powers of 2 and then modifying it to meet the requirements. However, this approach has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Powers of 2**: The program generates a list of numbers `[1 << i for i in range(21)]`, which are powers of 2. This list will only cover sums up to \(2^{20} - 1\) (or 1,048,575), which is far larger than the constraints of the problem (where \(n \leq 10^6\)). This means the generated sequence might not cover all required sums within the given constraints.

2. **Modification Logic**: The logic for modifying the list `nums` to ensure the conditions are met is flawed. Specifically, the code removes one element and adds others, but it does not guarantee that all sums from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) can be formed as subsequences while ensuring no subsequence sums to \(k\).

3. **No Subsequence Summing to \(k\)**: The program does not ensure that no subsequence of the generated list sums to \(k\). The current logic does not properly handle this requirement.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need a different approach that ensures the sequence meets both conditions. Here's a more appropriate solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        # Generate a sequence that covers all sums from 1 to n-1 except k
        # Use a simple approach like [1, 2, ..., n-1]
        nums = list(range(1, n))
        # Ensure no subsequence sums to k
        if k in nums:
            nums.remove(k)
        # Add an extra element to make sure no subsequence sums to k
        nums.append(n + 1)
        print(len(nums))
        print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))

func()
```

This solution generates a sequence from 1 to \(n-1\) and ensures that \(k\) is not included in the sequence. Adding \(n+1\) ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\). This approach meets the problem's requirements and constraints.
