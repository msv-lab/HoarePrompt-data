Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This is done using the list comprehension `[1 << i for i in range(21)]`.
   - This list will have values like `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`.

3. **Finding the Index**:
   - The program iterates through the list `nums` to find the index `idx` where `nums[i]` is the largest value less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `nums[i]` exceeds `k`, it breaks the loop and sets `idx` to `i - 1`.

4. **Appending Values**:
   - The program appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - Finally, it removes the element `1 << idx` from `nums`.

5. **Output**:
   - The length of `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The values in `nums` are powers of 2 and some additional values derived from these powers.
   - Since no combination of these values can sum exactly to `k` (as they are powers of 2 and derived values), this condition is satisfied.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The values in `nums` include all powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - By appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by subsequences.
   - Removing `1 << idx` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence `a` that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
