You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

    #State: Output State: The number of elements in the list `nums` after processing each test case, followed by the elements themselves. The list `nums` will contain up to 23 unique integers for each test case, which are derived from the value of `k` and some powers of 2. Specifically, the list will include the following elements: \(2^{0}\) to \(2^{20}\), the value of `k`, `k-2^idx`, `k+1`, and `k+2^idx+1`, where `idx` is the index just before the first power of 2 greater than `k`. The exact elements and their count depend on the specific values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it generates a list `nums` containing up to 23 unique integers derived from \(k\) and some powers of 2. Specifically, the list includes the values \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), the value of \(k\), \(k - 2^{idx}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{idx} + 1\), where \(idx\) is the index just before the first power of 2 greater than \(k\). The function then prints the number of elements in `nums` followed by the elements themselves.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This is done using the list comprehension `[1 << i for i in range(21)]`.
   - This list will have values like `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`.

3. **Finding the Index**:
   - The program iterates through the list `nums` to find the index `idx` where `nums[i]` is the largest value less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `nums[i]` exceeds `k`, it breaks the loop and sets `idx` to `i - 1`.

4. **Appending Values**:
   - The program appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - Finally, it removes the element `1 << idx` from `nums`.

5. **Output**:
   - The length of `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The values in `nums` are powers of 2 and some additional values derived from these powers.
   - Since no combination of these values can sum exactly to `k` (as they are powers of 2 and derived values), this condition is satisfied.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The values in `nums` include all powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - By appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by subsequences.
   - Removing `1 << idx` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence `a` that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
