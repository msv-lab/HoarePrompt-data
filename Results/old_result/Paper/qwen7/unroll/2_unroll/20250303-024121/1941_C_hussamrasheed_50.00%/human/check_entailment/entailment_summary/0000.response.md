Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s`. However, the logic used to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful is flawed. Specifically:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string.
2. **Removing Substrings**: The program removes all instances of "map" from the string but does not handle the removal of "pie" properly. It simply counts the remaining occurrences of "pie" after removing "map".
3. **Logic Flaw**: The program assumes that removing all "map" instances and counting the remaining "pie" instances will give the minimum deletions needed. This is incorrect because:
   - Removing "map" might create new opportunities for "pie" to form.
   - The program does not account for overlapping substrings or the order in which "map" and "pie" appear.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we remove the minimum number of characters such that no "map" or "pie" remains. One approach could be to iterate through the string and remove characters one by one, checking after each removal whether the string still contains "map" or "pie".

Given the flaws in the current logic, the provided solution does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
