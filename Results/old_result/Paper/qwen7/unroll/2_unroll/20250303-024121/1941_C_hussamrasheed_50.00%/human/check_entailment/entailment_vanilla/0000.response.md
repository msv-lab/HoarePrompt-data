Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s` using `s.count('map')` and stores this count in `m`.
   - It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using `s.replace('map', '')` and reassigns the result back to `s`.
   - Next, it counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` using `s.count('pie')` and stores this count in `p`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Overlapping Substrings:**
   - The program uses `s.replace('map', '')` to remove all occurrences of "map". However, this method only removes the first occurrence of "map" at a time and does not handle overlapping substrings correctly.
   - For example, in the string "mapmap", `s.replace('map', '')` would result in "map", not an empty string. This means that the program would incorrectly count "map" twice.

2. **Incorrect Counting of "pie":**
   - After removing "map" from the string, the program counts the occurrences of "pie" in the modified string. However, since "map" was partially removed, the positions of "pie" might have changed, leading to incorrect counts.

3. **Lack of Deletion Logic:**
   - The program does not actually perform any deletions; it only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie". It does not provide a way to determine the minimum number of deletions needed to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

### Correct Solution Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
2. Determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove all these occurrences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        # Find all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'
        map_indices = [m.start() for m in re.finditer('map', s)]
        pie_indices = [p.start() for p in re.finditer('pie', s)]
        
        # Sort indices to process them in order
        all_indices = sorted(map_indices + pie_indices)
        
        # Initialize variables
        deletions = 0
        last_index = -1
        
        # Process each index
        for index in all_indices:
            if index > last_index:
                deletions += 1
                last_index = index + 2  # Skip the next two characters after 'map' or 'pie'
        
        print(deletions)

import re
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle overlapping substrings and does not perform the necessary deletions. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
