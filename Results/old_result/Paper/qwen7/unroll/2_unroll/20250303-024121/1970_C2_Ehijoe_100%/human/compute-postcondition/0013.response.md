Postcondition: **`empty` is False, `t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is a list of length `n-1` containing pairs of integers representing the edges of the tree, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) of the tree, `start` is an integer equal to the input integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `moves` is a boolean value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)` and is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the keys are integers from 1 to n and the values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of each node.**
