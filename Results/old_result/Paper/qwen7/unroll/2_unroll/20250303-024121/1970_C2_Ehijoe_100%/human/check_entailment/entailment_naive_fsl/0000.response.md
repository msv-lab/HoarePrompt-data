Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. The function `func_1` is intended to check if there is a move available from the current node, but it does not actually simulate the game or determine the winner based on optimal play. Instead, it checks if the current node has any inactive neighbors, which is not sufficient to determine the winner.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game for each round and determine the winner based on optimal play. The current implementation does not handle the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione and does not account for the fact that both players play optimally. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
