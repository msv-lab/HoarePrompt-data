The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), `t` (an integer such that t = 1), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, where each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v), `leaves` (a deque containing the leaf nodes of the tree), `start` (an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n), and `moves` (a boolean value indicating whether Ron can make a move). 

Based on the input parameters, the function returns either an error message if `t` is not equal to 1, or it processes the tree structure defined by `edges` and `leaves`, starting from node `start`, and determines the outcome based on the `moves` parameter.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, t, edges, leaves, start, and moves. It checks if t equals 1, and if not, returns an error. Otherwise, it processes the tree structure, starting from node start, and determines the outcome based on the moves parameter.**
