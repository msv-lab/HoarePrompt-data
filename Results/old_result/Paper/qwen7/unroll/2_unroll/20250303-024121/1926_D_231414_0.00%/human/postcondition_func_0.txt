The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, ..., a_n` (where \(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31}\)). For each test case, it calculates and prints the count of unique elements in the list after performing bitwise XOR operations. The function does not return any value but prints the count for each sub-case. The variables `t` and `check` remain unchanged after processing all test cases.
