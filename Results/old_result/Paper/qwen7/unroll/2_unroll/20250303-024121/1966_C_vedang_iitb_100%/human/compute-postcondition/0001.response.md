Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `tc in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `tc` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `tc`**: The variable `tc` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts because `range(t)` generates values from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `tc < t`. Therefore, `tc` must be less than `t` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the State**: Given that `tc` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `tc < t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself. Specifically, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: The initial state of `t` is given as an input integer, and since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0, we need to ensure this condition is met.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
