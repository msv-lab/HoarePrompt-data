Output State: The output state consists of the names "Alice" or "Bob" printed for each test case based on the conditions inside the loop. For each test case, if `mexsize` (the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sorted list `a`) is greater than `maxsize` (the maximum value in the list `a`), then "Alice" is printed if `mexsize` is even, and "Bob" is printed if `mexsize` is odd. Otherwise, "Alice" is printed if `mexsize` is odd, and "Bob" is printed if `mexsize` is even.
