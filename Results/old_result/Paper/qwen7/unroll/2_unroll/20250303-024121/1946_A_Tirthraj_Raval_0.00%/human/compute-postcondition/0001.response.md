Output State: **t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and the array a contains n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
