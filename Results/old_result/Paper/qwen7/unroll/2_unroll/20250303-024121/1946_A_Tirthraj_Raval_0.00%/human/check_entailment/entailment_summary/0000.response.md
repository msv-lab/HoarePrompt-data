Reasoning:
- The provided program only counts the occurrences of the middle element(s) in the sorted array but does not perform any operations to increase the median value.
- According to the problem statement, the goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the current implementation does not attempt to modify the array elements to achieve this.
- The program fails to address the core requirement of increasing the median through operations, which means it does not solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
