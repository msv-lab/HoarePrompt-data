Output State: t is the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the array a contains n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. After sorting the array a, p is set to (n + 1) // 2 - 1, and res is the count of the element at index p in the sorted array a. The loop prints res for each test case.
