Output State: t test cases are processed. For each test case, the output consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans`. The list `ans` contains specific values based on the input `k` for each test case. Specifically, `ans` includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and powers of 2 up to 2^19 (since the loop runs 20 times). Here, `i` is determined such that `1 << i + 1` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
