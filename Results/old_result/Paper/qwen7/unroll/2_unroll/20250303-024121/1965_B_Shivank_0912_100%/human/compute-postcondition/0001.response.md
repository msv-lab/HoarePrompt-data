Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `tc` and the expression `range(t)`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `tc`**: The variable `tc` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
3. **Determine the Value of `t`**: The value of `t` is given as an input, and it is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means that `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` must be greater than 0.

The final state before the loop starts should reflect this requirement.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
