Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - It initializes an index `i` to 0.
   - The loop `while 1 << i + 1 <= k:` finds the largest `i` such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\). This effectively finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three values:
     - `k - (1 << i)` which is a value ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - `k + 1` which is used to ensure that subsequences can sum to `k + 1`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)` which is used to ensure that subsequences can sum to `k + 1 + 2^i`.
   - Additional values are appended to `ans` using `1 << j` for `j` ranging from 0 to 19, excluding `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
   - The value `k - (1 << i)` ensures that no subsequence can sum exactly to `k` because any subsequence including this value would have a sum that includes `k - (1 << i)` and possibly other values, but never exactly `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The values `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` along with powers of 2 (`1 << j`) ensure that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence.
   - Specifically, the values `1 << j` allow forming all sums from 1 to \(2^{20} - 1\).

3. **Sequence Size Constraint**:
   - The sequence size is at most 25, which is satisfied since the maximum length of `ans` is 23 (3 fixed values + 20 additional values).

### Conclusion:

The program constructs a sequence that meets all the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
