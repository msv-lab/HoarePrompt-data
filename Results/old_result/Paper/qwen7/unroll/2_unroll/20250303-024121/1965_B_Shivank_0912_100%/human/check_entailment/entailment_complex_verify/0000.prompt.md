You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)

    #State: Output State: t test cases are processed. For each test case, the output consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans`. The list `ans` contains specific values based on the input `k` for each test case. Specifically, `ans` includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and powers of 2 up to 2^19 (since the loop runs 20 times). Here, `i` is determined such that `1 << i + 1` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` (the number of test cases), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and outputs a list `ans` containing specific values derived from `k`. The list includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and powers of 2 up to 2^19. Here, `i` is determined such that `1 << i + 1` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. For each test case, it prints the length of the list `ans` followed by its elements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the program constructs a sequence that includes numbers like `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` along with powers of 2 up to `1 << 19`. However, this approach does not guarantee that for all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there will be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

For instance, consider the test case `n = 10` and `k = 7`. The generated sequence might look something like `[0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 7 - (1 << 2), 7 + 1, 7 + 1 + (1 << 2)] = [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 8, 11]`. This sequence does not include all necessary subsequences that sum to values between 1 and 10 except for 7. For example, there is no subsequence that sums to 6 or 9.

To meet the problem's requirements, the sequence must ensure that every integer from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum, which the current implementation does not guarantee. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
