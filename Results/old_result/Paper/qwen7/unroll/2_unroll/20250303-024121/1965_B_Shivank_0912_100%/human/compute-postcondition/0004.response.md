Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes three inputs: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 2 and 10^6), and k (a positive integer between 1 and n). The function returns information based on these inputs, specifically checking if k is less than or equal to n and ensuring t is within the specified range. If any condition is not met, it handles the error accordingly.**
