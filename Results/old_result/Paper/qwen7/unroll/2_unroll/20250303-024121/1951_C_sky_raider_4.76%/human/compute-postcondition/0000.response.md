Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, which starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
   - `int(input())` reads an integer input from the user.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the value read from `input()` is a positive integer. Given the problem constraints, `t` (the integer read from input) is guaranteed to be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1, the loop will execute `t` times.
   - The value of `i` at the start of the first iteration should be 0.
   - The value of `i` at the start of the second iteration should be 1, and so on.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 initially and that the value of `t` is correctly read from input.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `i` should be 0.
- The value of `t` (read from input) must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.
