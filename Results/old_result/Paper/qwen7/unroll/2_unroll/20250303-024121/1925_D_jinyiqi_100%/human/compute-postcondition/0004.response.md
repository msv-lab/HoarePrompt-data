Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the result of the expression `(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` for each iteration of the outer loop. Each value of `p` and `q` is derived from the inputs provided in each iteration of the inner loop, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) operation is used to simplify the fraction before performing the modular inverse and final modulo operation with `M`.

Each line of output will contain one such result, corresponding to one complete set of inputs provided by the `input()` function calls within the loop. The number of lines in the output will be equal to the value of `t`, which is the number of times the outer loop runs.
