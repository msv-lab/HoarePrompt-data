Output State: **`idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is even, and n - k + 1 ≥ 1; `permutation` is a list of n zeros, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 1.**

The code initializes `curr_v` to 1. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `curr_v` while keeping all other variables unchanged.
