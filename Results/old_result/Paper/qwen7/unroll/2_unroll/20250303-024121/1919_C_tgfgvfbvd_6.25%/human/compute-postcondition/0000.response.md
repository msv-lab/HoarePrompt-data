Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder typically used when the loop variable itself is not needed. However, the loop still depends on the value returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the initial state, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `int(input())` will return a value within this range, ensuring the loop can execute.

3. **Consider the input process**: Since the loop depends on the user input, the state of the program before the loop starts should reflect that the input will be valid. Specifically, the input should be a positive integer within the specified range.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The only state that needs adjustment is the one that ensures the loop can execute, which is the input value. Therefore, the state before the loop should ensure that the input value is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Based on this reasoning, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the input value is a positive integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
