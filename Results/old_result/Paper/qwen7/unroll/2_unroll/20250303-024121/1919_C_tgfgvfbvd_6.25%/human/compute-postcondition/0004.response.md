Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. It counts the number of elements in the list that are either greater than both the initial values of a and b or less than both a and b, where a and b are updated based on certain conditions within the loop. The function prints the count for each test case and does not return any value.**
