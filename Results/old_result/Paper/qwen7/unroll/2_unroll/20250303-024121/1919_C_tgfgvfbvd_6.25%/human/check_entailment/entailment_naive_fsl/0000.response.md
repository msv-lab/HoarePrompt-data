Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to find a way to split the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) such that the total penalty \(p(s) + p(t)\) is minimized. However, the logic inside the loop does not accurately determine the optimal split.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `3`, which can be achieved by splitting the array as \(s = [2, 4, 5]\) and \(t = [1, 3]\). However, the program does not correctly handle this scenario. It tries to find a maximum element and then checks subsequent elements to update \(a\) and \(b\), but this approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

A more appropriate approach would involve sorting the array and then finding the longest non-decreasing subsequence, as the penalty is defined by the number of inversions in the subsequences. This requires a different algorithmic approach to ensure the minimum penalty is calculated correctly.
