Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, the variable c contains the count of elements in the list l that satisfy the condition of being either greater than both a and b or less than both a and b, where a and b are updated according to the rules within the loop. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
