Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, and `results` is a list containing strings with either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. After the loop executes all the iterations, the `results` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described. The loop simply prints each element in the `results` list without changing its contents.
