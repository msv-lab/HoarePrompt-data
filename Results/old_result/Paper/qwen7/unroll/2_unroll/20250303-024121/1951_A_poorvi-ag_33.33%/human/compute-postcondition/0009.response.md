Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `arr`. It checks if the string `arr` meets specific conditions related to the count of '1's in the string. Based on these conditions, it appends 'yes' or 'no' to a results list. Finally, it prints each element in the results list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything, but it modifies a list of results based on the input strings.**
