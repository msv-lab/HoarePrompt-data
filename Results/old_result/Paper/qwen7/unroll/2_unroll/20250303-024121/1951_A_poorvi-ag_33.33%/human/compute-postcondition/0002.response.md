Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `t` used in the `range()` function.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, the loop can execute if `t` is at least 1.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means adjusting the state such that the loop condition is met.

Given the initial states:
- `start` is an integer (this variable is not involved in the loop condition).
- `end` is an integer (this variable is not involved in the loop condition).
- `t` is an input integer (we need to ensure `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute).
- `results` is an empty list (this variable is not involved in the loop condition).

The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
