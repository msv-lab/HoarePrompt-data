Output State: The value of `t`, which is the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines where each line contains an integer `ans`. This integer `ans` represents the sum calculated based on the input string `s` and the integer `m` for each test case. Specifically, `ans` is calculated by checking how many times each character in the string 'ABCDEF' appears in `s` and comparing it with `m`. If a character does not appear in `s`, `ans` increases by `m`. If a character appears fewer times than `m`, `ans` increases by the difference.
