The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), and a string a consisting of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of `ans`, which represents the total number of additional occurrences of characters 'A' to 'F' needed in the string `a` to meet the requirement of having at least m occurrences of each character, across all iterations.
