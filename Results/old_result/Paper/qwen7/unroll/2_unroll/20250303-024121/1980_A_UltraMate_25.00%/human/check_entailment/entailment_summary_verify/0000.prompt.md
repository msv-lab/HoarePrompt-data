You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), and a string a consisting of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of `ans`, which represents the total number of additional occurrences of characters 'A' to 'F' needed in the string `a` to meet the requirement of having at least m occurrences of each character, across all iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the required number of problems for a specific difficulty level exceeds the total number of rounds `m`. Specifically, the program incorrectly adds `m` for each missing difficulty level, rather than ensuring that the total number of problems needed for each difficulty level does not exceed `m`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
7 2
ABCDEFGB
5 3
ABCDEFAB
4 1
ABCDEFAB
```

- For the first test case (`7 2 ABCDEFGB`), the program should output `1` because we need one 'G' and one 'C', but the program outputs `2`.
- For the second test case (`5 3 ABCDEFAB`), the program should output `3` because we need three 'A's, three 'B's, and one each of 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', but the program outputs `6`.
- For the third test case (`4 1 ABCDEFAB`), the program should output `2` because we need one 'A' and one 'B', but the program outputs `2`.

The program fails to ensure that the total number of problems needed for each difficulty level does not exceed `m`, leading to incorrect results.
