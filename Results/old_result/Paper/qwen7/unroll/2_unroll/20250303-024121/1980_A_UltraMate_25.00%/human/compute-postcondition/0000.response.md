Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `t` is now the integer value entered by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, after executing the code, `t` will be set to the integer value entered by the user, which must still satisfy the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, and `a`) remain unaffected by this code snippet.
