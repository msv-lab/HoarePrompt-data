State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer.
- Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and it represents the number of iterations, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0.
