Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t, followed by t pairs of integers n and k. For each pair, there are k lines, each containing n unique integers ranging from 1 to n. The function returns a result based on the given conditions and data structure described.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each starting with a positive integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases. Each test case then specifies two integers n and k, with constraints on their values. Following this, there are k lines, each containing n unique integers. The function processes this structured input and returns a result based on the specified conditions and data structure.
