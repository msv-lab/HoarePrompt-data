Output State: **`t` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer, and the code only changes the value of `t` by taking an input, the updated state is that `t` is now the input integer provided by the user. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
