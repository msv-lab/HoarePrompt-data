### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` (the number of participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively).

2. **Single Screenshot Case**:
   - If `m == 1`, the function immediately prints 'yes' without further checks. This is correct because a single screenshot doesn't contradict any other possible order.

3. **Comparing First Two Screenshots**:
   - The function compares the first two screenshots (`a1, l1` and `a2, l2`). It removes the author from both lists and checks if the remaining lists match.
   - If they don't match, it prints 'no' and moves to the next test case. This part is correct.

4. **Finding Insertion Points**:
   - The function attempts to find the correct insertion points for the author of the first screenshot (`a1`) and the second screenshot (`a2`) in the combined list.
   - If the insertion points are found, it inserts the author into the appropriate position and continues checking subsequent screenshots.

5. **Handling Multiple Screenshots**:
   - For multiple screenshots, the function iteratively checks if the current screenshot matches the expected order after inserting the author's position.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no'. If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The function correctly handles the edge case where `m == 1` by printing 'yes' without further checks.
  - The function correctly identifies when the orders do not match and prints 'no'.
  - The function correctly handles the insertion of authors and checks the order of subsequent screenshots.

- **Logic for Finding Insertion Points**:
  - The logic for finding the correct insertion points is flawed. Specifically, the function assumes that the first mismatch between `l1` and `l2` indicates the correct insertion point, which is not always true. For example, consider the following scenario:
    - `n = 4`, `m = 2`
    - `l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
    - `l2 = [2, 1, 4, 3]`
    - Here, `a1 = 1` and `a2 = 2`. The function would incorrectly insert `a2` at index 1 in `l2`, resulting in `[2, 2, 1, 4, 3]`, which is invalid.

- **Iterative Check for Subsequent Screenshots**:
  - The function iterates through the remaining screenshots and checks if they match the expected order. However, the way it handles the insertion points and the subsequent checks is not robust enough to handle all possible scenarios.

### Example Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`
- `l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `l2 = [2, 1, 4, 3]`

The function would incorrectly insert `a2` at index 1 in `l2`, leading to an invalid sequence.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the correct insertion points and checking the order of subsequent screenshots. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
