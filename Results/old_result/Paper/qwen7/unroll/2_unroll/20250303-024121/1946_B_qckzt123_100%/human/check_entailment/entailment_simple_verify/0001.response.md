### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly breaks down the problem and the provided solution. Let's re-evaluate the solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `MOD = 1000000007`: Correctly defined modulo value.
   - `T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())`: Reads the number of test cases.

2. **Loop over Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, reads `n` and `k`.
   - Reads the array `a`.

3. **Calculate Initial Sum and Maximum Prefix Sum**:
   - `s = sum(a)`: Calculates the initial sum of the array.
   - `t, tmp = 0, 0`: Initializes variables for tracking the maximum prefix sum (`t`) and a temporary sum (`tmp`).
   - Iterates through the array to calculate the maximum prefix sum:
     ```python
     for x in a:
         tmp += x
         if tmp < 0:
             tmp = 0
         t = max(tmp, t)
     ```
     This calculates the maximum sum of any prefix of the array (essentially the maximum subarray sum).

4. **Calculate Final Answer**:
   - `ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`: Adds the initial sum and the maximum prefix sum, then takes modulo.
   - For each operation (`k-1` times), doubles the maximum prefix sum and adds it to the answer, taking modulo after each addition:
     ```python
     for i in range(k - 1):
         t *= 2
         t %= MOD
         ans += t
         ans %= MOD
     ```
     This step aims to maximize the sum by repeatedly adding the maximum prefix sum multiple times.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - Prints the result.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Maximum Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  - The calculation of the maximum prefix sum using `tmp` and `t` is correct. It ensures that we get the largest possible sum of any contiguous subarray.

- **Doubling the Maximum Prefix Sum**:
  - Doubling the maximum prefix sum in each operation is a valid strategy to maximize the sum. Since the sum of the array can be increased by adding the same positive value multiple times, doubling the maximum prefix sum in each operation ensures that the sum is maximized.

- **Modulo Operation**:
  - The modulo operation is handled correctly to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The solution handles negative numbers correctly by resetting `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative.
  - The doubling operation and modulo operation are performed correctly to avoid overflow and ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. The original assessment accurately describes the solution and its correctness.

**Final: True**

The solution is correct.
