t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; the array a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; the result is calculated modulo 10^9 + 7.
