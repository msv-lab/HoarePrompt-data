Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It also reads the array `a` and calculates the initial sum `s`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Prefix Sum (`t`)**:
   - The program uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum prefix sum (`t`). This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum `tmp`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to zero. The maximum value of `tmp` is stored in `t`.

3. **Calculating the Answer**:
   - The initial answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the program doubles the maximum prefix sum `t` and adds it to the answer, taking modulo `MOD` to ensure the result stays within bounds.

4. **Output**:
   - The final answer is printed for each test case.

The program handles all constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
