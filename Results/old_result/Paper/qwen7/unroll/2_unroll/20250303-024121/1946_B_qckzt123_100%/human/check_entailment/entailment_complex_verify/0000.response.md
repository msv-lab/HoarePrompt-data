### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then reads the array \( a \).

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum \( s \) of the array \( a \) is calculated.
   - The maximum prefix sum \( t \) is calculated using Kadane's algorithm. This ensures that \( t \) is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray starting from the beginning of the array.

3. **Initial Result Calculation**:
   - The initial result \( ans \) is set to \( (s + t) \% MOD \). This represents the best possible sum after the first operation.

4. **Subsequent Operations**:
   - For each of the remaining \( k-1 \) operations, the program doubles the current maximum prefix sum \( t \) and adds it to the result.
   - This is valid because each doubling operation simulates adding the sum of a subarray multiple times, which increases the overall sum of the array.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result \( ans \) is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large sums.

Given the above steps, let's validate the logic with the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Input: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \), \( a = [-4, -7] \)
  - Sum \( s = -4 + (-7) = -11 \)
  - Maximum prefix sum \( t = 0 \) (since both elements are negative)
  - Initial result \( ans = (-11 + 0) \% 1000000007 = -11 \mod 1000000007 = 999999996 \)

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \), \( a = [2, 2, 8] \)
  - Sum \( s = 2 + 2 + 8 = 12 \)
  - Maximum prefix sum \( t = 12 \) (since the entire array is considered)
  - Initial result \( ans = (12 + 12) \% 1000000007 = 24 \mod 1000000007 = 24 \)
  - After the first operation, \( t = 24 \)
  - After the second operation, \( t = 48 \)
  - After the third operation, \( t = 96 \)
  - Final result \( ans = 24 + 48 + 96 = 168 \mod 1000000007 = 168 \)

The program correctly handles these examples and other test cases provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after performing \( k \) operations. The initial assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
