Reasoning:
The provided program does not match the requirements of the problem statement. The main issue is that it initializes the dictionary `d` incorrectly and does not properly handle the logic to calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of Dictionary**: The dictionary `d` is initialized using `default_value`, but `default_value` is not defined anywhere in the code. This will result in a NameError.
2. **Counting Problems**: The code attempts to count the occurrences of each difficulty level, but it initializes each difficulty level to 0 manually instead of using the dictionary values.
3. **Calculation Logic**: The logic to calculate the number of additional problems needed is flawed. It checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m` and adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. However, this logic does not correctly account for the total number of rounds (`m`) required.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
