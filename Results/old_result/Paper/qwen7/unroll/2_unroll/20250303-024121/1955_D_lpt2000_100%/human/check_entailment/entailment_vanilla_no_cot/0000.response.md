Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program converts the list `aa` and `bb` to strings using `str(i)` which is unnecessary since the input values are already integers. This can be removed.

2. **Counter Initialization**: The counters `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` are initialized with the first `m` elements of `aa` and all elements of `bb`. However, these should be initialized with the full lists `aa` and `bb`.

3. **Logic for Sliding Window**: The logic for updating the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` when sliding the window is incorrect. Specifically, the conditions for updating these counters are not correctly implemented.

4. **Final Count Calculation**: The final count `fnd` is incremented without properly checking the conditions for adding new elements and removing old elements from the sliding window.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        (n, m, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        E = cnt_aa - D
        C = cnt_bb - D
        
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        for i in range(m, n):
            out_aa = aa[i - m]
            in_aa = aa[i]
            
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                D[in_aa] += 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
                C[in_aa] -= 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)

func()
```

This corrected version initializes the counters correctly and updates them properly as the sliding window moves through the array `aa`.
