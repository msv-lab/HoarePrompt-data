Output State: **`nabors` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.**

This means that the variable `nabors` is now assigned the value of an integer input, which is within the range 1 to 10^4. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) retain their initial states as described.
