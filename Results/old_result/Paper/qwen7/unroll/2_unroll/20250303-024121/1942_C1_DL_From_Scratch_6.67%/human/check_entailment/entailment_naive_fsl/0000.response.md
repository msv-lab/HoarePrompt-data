Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program attempts to count the number of gaps between the chosen vertices, assuming these gaps can be filled with additional vertices to form triangles. However, this approach does not account for the fact that the chosen vertices themselves can also be used to form triangles, and it does not handle the case where the chosen vertices are consecutive.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 2 0
1 3
```
The program should output `2` because the two chosen vertices (1 and 3) can form one triangle with the remaining vertices (2 and 4). However, the program incorrectly outputs `0` because it does not account for the possibility of forming triangles using the chosen vertices directly.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the chosen vertices and their positions to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed. Specifically, it should check if the chosen vertices are consecutive and adjust the count accordingly.
