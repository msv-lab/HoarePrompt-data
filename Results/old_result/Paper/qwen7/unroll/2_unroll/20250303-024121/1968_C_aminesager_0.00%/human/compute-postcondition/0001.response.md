Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
3. **Check the loop execution requirement**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t > 0`).

Given that `t` is initially an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it already satisfies the condition `t > 0`. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `t`.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `t`, and it already meets the condition for the loop to execute, no changes are needed.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
