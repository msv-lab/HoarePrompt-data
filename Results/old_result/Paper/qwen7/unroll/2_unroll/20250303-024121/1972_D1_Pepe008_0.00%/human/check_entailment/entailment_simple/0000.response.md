Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this problem using a specific formula for calculating `suma`, which is derived from the constraints and properties of the problem.
3. The inner loop iterates over possible values of \(i\) (which corresponds to \(b\)), and for each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\). This formula seems to be an attempt to count the valid values of \(a\) for each fixed \(i\).
4. The logic inside the loop checks if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) before adding \(x\) to `suma`, ensuring that only valid ranges of \(a\) are considered.
5. Finally, the program prints `suma - 1` for each test case, which aligns with the requirement to output the number of valid pairs for each test case.

Given the structure and the logic of the program, it appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
