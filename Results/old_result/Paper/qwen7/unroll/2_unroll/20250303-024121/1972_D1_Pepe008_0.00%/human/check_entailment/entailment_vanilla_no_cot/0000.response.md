Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop Boundaries**: The inner loop should iterate from `1` to `b`, not `4` to `b+1`. The original code snippet had a typo where `4` was mistakenly used instead of `1`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**: The formula used to calculate `x` is incorrect. The logic to count valid pairs should be based on the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The current implementation does not correctly reflect this condition.

3. **Redundant Print Statement**: There is a commented-out print statement inside the loop which should be removed or properly integrated into the logic.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(i, a)
            if (a + i) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible values of `i` from `1` to `b`, calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `i` and `a`, and checks if the condition \( a + i \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(i, a) \). If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count `suma`. Finally, it prints the total count of valid pairs for each test case.
