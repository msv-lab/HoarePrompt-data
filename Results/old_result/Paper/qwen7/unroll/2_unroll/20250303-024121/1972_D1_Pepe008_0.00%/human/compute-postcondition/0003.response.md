Output State: T is an input integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, and for each iteration t in the range of T, the variable `suma` is calculated based on the given formula and printed, then the process repeats until all iterations are completed. The final output state will have executed all the iterations and printed the value of `suma - 1` for each iteration.
