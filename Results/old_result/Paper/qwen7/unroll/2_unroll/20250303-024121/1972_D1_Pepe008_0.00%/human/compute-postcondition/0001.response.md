Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for t in range(T):`. The variables involved here are `t` and `T`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `T` is given as an input integer, and it is specified that `1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4`.
   - `t` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t < T`. Therefore, the loop will start and continue executing as long as `t` is less than `T`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `t` starts from 0, it will be 0 at the beginning of the first iteration.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be less than `T` initially. This means `T` must be greater than 0 (which is already implied by the given constraint `1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `T` and `t`.

**Final State**:
- `t` is 0.
- `T` must be greater than 0 (which is already ensured by the given constraint).

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0**
