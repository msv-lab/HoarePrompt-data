Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of `i` up to `b` and calculating a value `x` based on a specific formula. However, there are several issues with the logic and the formula used in the program:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop**: The original code has an inner loop that iterates from `1` to `4`, which is not relevant to the problem statement. This should be removed.
2. **Formula Misuse**: The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
3. **GCD Calculation**: The program does not actually compute the GCD of `a` and `b` within the loop, which is necessary to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
