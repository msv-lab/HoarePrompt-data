Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `a`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.
4. In `func_1`:
   - It initializes an array `count` of size 7 to zero, which will store the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each character.
   - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by comparing the current count with the required `m`. If the current count is less than `m`, it adds the difference to `needed_problems`.
   - Finally, it returns the total number of additional problems needed.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed to meet the requirement of having `m` rounds with problems of all difficulty levels.

Correctness: **True**
