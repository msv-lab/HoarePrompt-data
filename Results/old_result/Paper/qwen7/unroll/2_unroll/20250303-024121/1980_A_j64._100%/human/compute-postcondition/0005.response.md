Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than 7.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 7. Therefore, the initial value of `i` must be 0 for the loop to start executing.

4. **List the states that need adjustment**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 0.

5. **Consider other relevant states**: While `count`, `n`, `m`, and `needed_problems` are not directly involved in the loop head, they might affect the loop's behavior. However, since the question specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we do not need to change these variables.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being set to 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0**
