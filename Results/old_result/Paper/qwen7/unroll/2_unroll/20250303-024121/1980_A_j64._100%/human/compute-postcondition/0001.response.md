Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for char in a:`. The variables involved here are `char` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
   - `char` will take on each character of `a` one by one during the loop iterations.

3. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `count` is a list of 7 zeros.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5.
   - `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each character in `a`, the initial value of `char` should be the first character of `a`.
   - The state of `a` itself does not change within the loop; it remains as a string of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` (to ensure it is a valid string of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G') and `char` (to be set to the first character of `a`).

**Final State**:
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
- `char` is the first character of `a`.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `char` is the first character of `a`**.
