Reasoning:
1. The problem requires processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of a string of length 5 made up of 'A' and 'B'.
2. The function `func()` correctly initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to zero before iterating through each character of the input string.
3. It increments the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B') based on the character encountered.
4. After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', it compares the counts and prints 'A' if `ac` is greater than `bc`, otherwise it prints 'B'.
5. The function handles all test cases as specified, ensuring that for each test case, the correct character ('A' or 'B') is printed based on the majority count.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
