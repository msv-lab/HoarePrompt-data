Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive. For each input string `s` provided in the range of `t`, the output is either 'A' or 'B' based on whether the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's in the string. If the number of 'A's is greater, 'A' is printed; otherwise, 'B' is printed.
