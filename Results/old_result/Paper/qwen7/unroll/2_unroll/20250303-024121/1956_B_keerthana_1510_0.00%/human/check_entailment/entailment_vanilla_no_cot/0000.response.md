Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func()` attempts to calculate the sum of elements divided by 3, which is not relevant to the problem statement. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, considering Nene's strategy of maximizing her score while minimizing yours.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

1. Count the occurrences of each card value.
2. Determine the best strategy for you to maximize your score while considering Nene's optimal play.
3. Simulate the game to find the maximum possible score you can achieve.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_points(n, cards):
    # Count the occurrences of each card value
    card_count = {}
    for card in cards:
        if card in card_count:
            card_count[card] += 1
        else:
            card_count[card] = 1
    
    # Sort the card values in descending order of their counts
    sorted_cards = sorted(card_count.keys(), key=lambda x: card_count[x], reverse=True)
    
    # Initialize your score
    your_score = 0
    
    # Simulate the game
    for _ in range(n):
        # Your turn
        for card in sorted_cards:
            if card_count[card] > 1:
                your_score += 1
                card_count[card] -= 2
                break
    
    return your_score

def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        cards = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        results.append(max_points(n, cards))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function
func()
```

This code reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
