Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates within a predefined context involving variables t, n, k, adj, x, L, R, numCuts, and leftover. It performs operations to determine the potential size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges and uses binary search to find the maximum possible size of these components.**

This functionality involves processing multiple test cases (indicated by t), where for each case, it analyzes a graph represented by an adjacency list (adj) to find the largest connected component size after removing a specified number of edges (k). The function uses a binary search approach to efficiently determine the maximum possible size of the remaining connected components.
