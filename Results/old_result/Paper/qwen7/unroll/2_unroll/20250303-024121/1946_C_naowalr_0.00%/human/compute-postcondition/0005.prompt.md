You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The adjacency list adj is constructed based on the input edges, where adj[v] is a list of vertices adjacent to vertex v. The variable x represents a potential size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The variables L and R represent the search range for binary search, initialized to 1 and 100001 respectively. The variable numCuts keeps track of the number of edges removed during the DFS traversal, and leftover represents the number of vertices in the largest connected component found during the DFS traversal.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `sys.stdin.readline()` is called to read the next line which will contain the value of `t`, for each of the `t` cases, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^5, `adj` is the adjacency list constructed based on the input edges, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` keeps track of the number of edges removed during the DFS traversal, and `leftover` represents the number of vertices in the largest connected component found during the DFS traversal, after executing the binary search to find the maximum size of the largest connected component that can remain after removing `k` edges, the result `L` is printed for each case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but operates within a predefined context involving variables t, n, k, adj, x, L, R, numCuts, and leftover. It performs operations to determine the potential size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges and uses binary search to find the maximum possible size of these components.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
