Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using spaces.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `data` (converted to an integer) to the variable `t`. The value of `data` remains unchanged, and the value of `t` is now the integer representation of the first element in `data`.
