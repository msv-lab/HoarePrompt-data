Output State: **`path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0; `dp[0]` is either 1 or -inf depending on the first character of `path`; `dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`**.

To break it down:
- The first part of the condition sets the initial value of `dp[0]` based on the first character of `path`. If `path[0]` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1; otherwise, if `path[0]` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to -inf.
- The code snippet updates `dp[1]` by adding 1 to `dp[0]` if `path[1]` is '@', or 0 if `path[1]` is not '@'. This means `dp[1]` will be `dp[0] + 1` if `path[1]` is '@', and `dp[0]` if `path[1]` is not '@'.
