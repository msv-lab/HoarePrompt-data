Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0. The first character of `path` is either '@' or '*', and if the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1, otherwise if the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to -inf. The value of `n` is greater than 1, and the second character of `path` is '*', and `dp[1]` is yet to be determined based on the value of the second character.
