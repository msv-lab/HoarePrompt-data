Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The problem involves finding the year when all signs of the apocalypse occur sequentially based on their periodicities. However, the code provided seems to be dealing with some kind of dynamic programming problem involving characters `@` and `*`, which are not related to the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to process a string of characters (`@` and `*`) and calculate some kind of score using dynamic programming. This is completely unrelated to the problem of finding the year when all signs occur.
3. The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. Again, this function is not relevant to the problem as stated.

Given that the provided functions do not implement the logic required to solve the problem, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
