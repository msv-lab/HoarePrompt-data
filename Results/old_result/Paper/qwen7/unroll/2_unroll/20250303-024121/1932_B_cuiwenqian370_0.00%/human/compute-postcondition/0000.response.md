Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. The next line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs. The function `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigned to `input`.**

Explanation: The code `input = sys.stdin.read` replaces the built-in `input()` function with `sys.stdin.read()`. This means that instead of reading input from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard), it reads the entire input as a single string. However, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
