Output State: **`password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `digits` is a list of sorted digits from the original `password`; `letters` is a list of lowercase Latin letters from the original `password`, sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `letters.sort()` sorts the list `letters` in ascending order. Since `letters` originally contained all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` in the order they appeared, after sorting, `letters` will contain these letters in alphabetical order. The values of `password` and `digits` remain unchanged.
