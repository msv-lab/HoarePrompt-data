### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Initial Assessment:
The initial assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where there are both digits and letters in the password, and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order. Specifically, the program checks if the digits are sorted correctly but does not ensure that the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order before concatenating them with the sorted digits.

#### Corrected Version:
The suggested correction includes an additional check to ensure that the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order before concatenating them with the sorted digits.

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Separation of Digits and Letters:**
   - The program correctly separates digits and letters into two lists.
   
2. **Sorting Digits and Letters:**
   - The digits and letters are sorted individually.
   
3. **Check for Sorted Digits:**
   - The program checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:`.
   
4. **Check for Sorted Letters:**
   - The program does not explicitly check if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. Instead, it implicitly checks this when it concatenates the sorted digits and letters and compares the result with the original password.
   
5. **Concatenation and Comparison:**
   - The program concatenates the sorted digits and letters and checks if the result matches the original password.
   - If the concatenated result matches the original password, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the above steps, the program does indeed check if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order implicitly through the concatenation and comparison step. The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program does not check if the letters are sorted.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement. The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does check if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order, even though it does so implicitly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
