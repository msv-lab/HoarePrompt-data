Output State: **(n, m, k, d) are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m; n, m, k, d are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

The code reads four integers from the input and splits them by spaces, assigning each to `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` respectively. The constraints on these variables remain unchanged, and the rows list is not affected by this code snippet.
