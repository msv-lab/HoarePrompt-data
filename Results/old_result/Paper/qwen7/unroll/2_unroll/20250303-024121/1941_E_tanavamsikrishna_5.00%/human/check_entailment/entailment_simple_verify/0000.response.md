### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: `row` is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
2. **First Loop**: This loop increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1.
   ```python
   for i in range(0, d - 1):
       row[i] = row[i] + 1
   ```
3. **Second Loop**: This loop calculates the cost for placing supports in the remaining elements of `row`.
   ```python
   for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
       row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
   ```
   - For each element `i` starting from `d-1` to the end of the row, the cost is calculated as the minimum value of the previous `d+1` elements (considering the boundary conditions) plus the original value of the current element plus 1.
4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the last element of the list `row`, which is the minimum value among the last `d+1` elements of the list, plus its original value plus 1.

The original assessment correctly points out that `func_1` does not handle the logic for placing supports according to the constraints. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d` and that supports are placed in the first and last columns.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: Reads the dimensions and the matrix of depths.
2. **Cost Calculation**: Calls `func_1` for each row and stores the results in the `costs` list.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: Computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores the results in the `total_costs` list.
4. **Output**: Prints the minimum total cost from the `total_costs` list.

The original assessment also correctly identifies that the `func_1` function is flawed and suggests a corrected version.

#### Corrected Version of `func_1`:
The suggested corrected version of `func_1` is:
```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    supports = [1]  # Support at the first column
    max_cost = 0
    for i in range(1, len(row) - 1):
        if i - supports[-1] <= d:
            supports.append(i)
        else:
            max_cost += min(row[supports[-1]:i]) + 1
            supports.append(i)
    max_cost += row[-1] + 1  # Support at the last column
    return max_cost
```
This corrected function ensures that supports are placed according to the constraints and calculates the minimum cost correctly.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports due to the flaws in the `func_1` function.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints.
