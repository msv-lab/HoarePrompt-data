### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `row` and an integer `d`.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1.
   - For the remaining elements, it sets each element to the minimum value of the previous `d+1` elements plus 1.
   - The function returns the last element of the modified `row`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` takes the dimensions of the grid `(n, m, k, d)` and the grid itself represented as a list of rows.
   - It computes the cost of placing supports for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in the `costs` list.
   - It then calculates the minimum total cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges by summing up `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list and storing these sums in the `total_costs` list.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from the `total_costs` list.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the cost of placing supports for a single row according to the problem constraints.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly computes the cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of individual rows and finding the minimum total cost.
   - The overall structure of the program matches the problem description and the provided example.

### Conclusion:
Given that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the required logic and the overall program structure aligns with the problem statement, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
