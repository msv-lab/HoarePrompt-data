State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at all, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. The problem statement specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
4. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500 for the loop to execute.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `t`, this is the only state that needs to be adjusted.
