Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each test case and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. For strings of length 5 consisting only of 'A' and 'B', the program will always produce the correct output. Since no edge cases or inputs violate the problem description, the program is correct.
