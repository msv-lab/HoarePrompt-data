Functionality: **The function processes a series of input strings, each of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. Based on which character appears more frequently ('A' or 'B'), it prints either 'A' or 'B' for each string. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each input string.**
