Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in a series of input strings, each of length 5.
2. The provided function correctly initializes counters for 'A' (`l`) and 'B' (`h`).
3. It iterates through each character in the input string, incrementing the appropriate counter based on the character.
4. After counting, it compares the two counters and prints the character that appears more frequently.
5. The logic is sound and should work for all valid inputs as per the problem description.
6. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code that would cause incorrect behavior.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
