You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of input strings, each of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. Based on which character appears more frequently ('A' or 'B'), it prints either 'A' or 'B' for each string. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each input string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - The program initializes two counters `l` (for 'A') and `h` (for 'B') to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `a`.
     - If the character is 'A', it increments the counter `l`.
     - If the character is 'B', it increments the counter `h`.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares the values of `l` and `h`.
   - If `l` is greater than `h`, it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

4. **Handling All Test Cases:**
   - The loop runs `t` times, ensuring all test cases are processed.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `ABABB`
  - Count: `l = 3`, `h = 2`
  - Output: `A` (Correct)
- **Test Case 2:** `ABABA`
  - Count: `l = 3`, `h = 2`
  - Output: `A` (Correct)
- **Test Case 3:** `BBBAB`
  - Count: `l = 2`, `h = 3`
  - Output: `B` (Correct)
- **Test Case 4:** `AAAAA`
  - Count: `l = 5`, `h = 0`
  - Output: `A` (Correct)
- **Test Case 5:** `BBBBB`
  - Count: `l = 0`, `h = 5`
  - Output: `B` (Correct)
- **Test Case 6:** `BABAA`
  - Count: `l = 3`, `h = 2`
  - Output: `A` (Correct)
- **Test Case 7:** `AAAAB`
  - Count: `l = 4`, `h = 1`
  - Output: `A` (Correct)
- **Test Case 8:** `BAAAA`
  - Count: `l = 4`, `h = 1`
  - Output: `A` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and determines the most frequent character. The logic is sound and the implementation matches the problem requirements.
