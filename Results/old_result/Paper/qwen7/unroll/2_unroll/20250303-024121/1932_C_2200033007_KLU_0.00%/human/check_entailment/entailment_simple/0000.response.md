Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the divisor `m`, the array `a`, and the string of commands `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` based on the commands in `s`.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array `a` from both ends.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the appropriate element from `a` to `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
   - After constructing `b`, it calculates the cumulative product of its elements in reverse order and appends these products to the list `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.

3. **Reversing the Cumulative Product**:
   - The line `return reversed(ans)` reverses the list `ans` before returning it. This is necessary because the problem requires the output to be in the order of the commands being processed, which is the reverse of how the cumulative product is calculated.

4. **Output**:
   - The main loop correctly calls the function `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

Given the above points, the program logic matches the problem statement accurately. The function constructs the list `b` correctly based on the commands and calculates the cumulative product in reverse order, which is then reversed again before being returned. This ensures that the output is in the correct order.

Correctness: **True**
