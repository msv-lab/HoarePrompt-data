### Reasoning:

The given program consists of two parts: `generate_files_for_html_in_range` and `func_1`. The problem statement asks us to evaluate the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function based on the provided problem description.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to create Python files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subdirectories whose names fall within a specified numeric range.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function correctly identifies subdirectories that match the numeric range criteria.
   - It then lists all `.html` files within these subdirectories.
   - For each `.html` file, it generates corresponding `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files by creating empty files.
   - The code prints the number of `.html` files found in each matching subdirectory and the generated file paths.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly uses `os` module functions to navigate directories and list files.
   - It checks the directory names against the specified range and processes only those that match.
   - The logic for generating the files is straightforward and follows the requirements without any apparent errors.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The function does not rely on user input or interact with the console, which aligns with the problem's assumption of valid inputs.

Based on the above analysis, the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function appears to be correct according to the provided problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
