You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both represent the inclusive range of folder names to process.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified within the loop body. For each iteration, the value of `n` (read from input) and string `s` (read from input) will determine whether 'YES' or 'NO' is printed. The initial values of `start`, `end`, and `t` will remain unchanged, and the output will reflect the results of the loop's conditions applied to the inputs provided during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a range of folder names specified by `start` and `end`, where `start` and `end` are integers and `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The function returns based on whether the range is valid (i.e., `start` is less than or equal to `end`), returning an error message if not. If the range is valid, it proceeds to process the folder names within the specified range.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
