Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of nodes \( n \) and the number of rounds \( t \) (which is always 1). It then processes the edges of the tree and the starting node for the game. The logic for constructing the deque `tree` seems to be flawed but is not critical since the problem specifies the tree has exactly two leaves, making it array-like.

2. **Tree Construction**: Given the constraints and the fact that the tree has exactly two leaves, the construction of the deque `tree` is unnecessary and overly complex. However, since the problem guarantees the structure, the current logic should still work as intended.

3. **Starting Node**: The starting node is correctly identified and its index within the deque is calculated.

4. **Move Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach the boundary of the tree from the starting node (`idx`). This calculation is based on the distance from the start to the beginning and end of the tree.

5. **Winning Condition**: The program checks if any of the calculated moves are odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins. This logic is correct based on the game rules provided.

6. **Output**: The program prints the winner based on the winning condition, which is correct.

Given that the problem statement and the annotated program align correctly, and the logic for determining the winner is sound, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
