Output State: **`empty` is True, `t` is an input integer, `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5, and `tree` is a deque object.**

The variable `empty` is set to `True`, which means the deque `tree` is initially empty. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
