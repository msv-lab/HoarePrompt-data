Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be set to 0 (the smallest possible value for `i`), and `n - 1` should be a positive number.

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `empty` is True: This state does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `t` is an input integer: This state does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`: This state does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`: This state does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5: This state ensures that `n - 1` is a positive number, which is necessary for the loop to execute.
   - `tree` is a deque object: This state does not affect the loop execution directly.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` should start from 0, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - Since `n - 1` must be a positive number, `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
