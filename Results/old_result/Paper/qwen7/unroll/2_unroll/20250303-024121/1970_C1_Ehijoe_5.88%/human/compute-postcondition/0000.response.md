Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5. `n` and `t` have been updated to the values inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, t = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. Since `t` was initially set to 1, it remains unchanged unless explicitly modified. The values of `u` and `v` are still within their original constraints (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), and the initial constraint on `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) is preserved.
