Output State: `empty` is False, `t` remains the same, `u` and `v` are updated based on the last input, `n` remains the same, and `tree` is a deque containing integers after processing all inputs. The `tree` deque will contain the integers `u` and `v` from each input line, depending on their positions relative to the deque's first and last elements, starting with the first two integers added when `empty` is True.
