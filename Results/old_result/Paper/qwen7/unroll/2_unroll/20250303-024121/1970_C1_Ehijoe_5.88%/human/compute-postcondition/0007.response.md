Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` remains the same, `u` and `v` are updated based on the last input, `n` remains the same, `tree` is a deque containing integers after processing all inputs with the integer `start` added to the end, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the element `start` within the deque `tree`. Since `start` was added to the end of `tree`, `idx` will be the position of `start` in the deque. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
