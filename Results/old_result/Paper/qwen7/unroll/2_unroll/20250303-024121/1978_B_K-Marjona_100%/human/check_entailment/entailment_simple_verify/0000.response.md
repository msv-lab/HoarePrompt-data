### Reasoning

Let's break down the program step-by-step and verify its correctness based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation of `k`**:
   - `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - This ensures that `k` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without exceeding the total number of buns or the difference between `b` and `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `a * n` because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - The term `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` represents the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (k - 1)`.
   - The term `(n - k) * a` represents the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `b <= a` correctly by printing `a * n`.
   - The formula used for calculating the profit when `b > a` is mathematically sound and correctly accounts for the decreasing price per bun.

5. **Verification Using Examples**:
   - Let's verify the program using the example provided in the problem statement:
     - For the first test case (`4 4 5`):
       - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
       - Profit = `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
     - For the second test case (`5 5 9`):
       - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
       - Profit = `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
     - For the third test case (`10 10 5`):
       - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
       - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`

The program correctly handles all the examples provided and the logic seems sound.
