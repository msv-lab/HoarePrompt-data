Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main logic. This is a minor issue that doesn't affect the correctness of the program.
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`ap`), which is stored in `ap`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop from `0` to `ap-1`.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into a single screen.
     - It adjusts `x` by subtracting `15 * bxsfory` (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and there are 3 columns, so each row can fit 3 * 4 / 4 = 3 icons, thus 15 cells per screen) plus `y * 4` (since each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells).
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15, which represents the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0:
     - It directly prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, since each 2x2 icon fits into half a screen.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0:
     - It directly prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, since each 1x1 icon fits into one-fifteenth of a screen.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
     - It prints 0, indicating no icons and thus no screens needed.

### Correctness Check

The logic in the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed based on the given constraints. However, let's verify the calculations:

- The calculation for `bxsfory` is correct as it accounts for the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into a single screen.
- The adjustment of `x` by subtracting `15 * bxsfory + y * 4` is correct as it accounts for the space taken by the 2x2 icons.
- The calculation for `bxsfory1` is correct as it accounts for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
- The final result is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons.

Given the example provided in the problem statement, the program produces the correct outputs for all test cases.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons.

**Correctness: True**
