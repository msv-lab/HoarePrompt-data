Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty according to the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The program calculates the penalty as `abs(sub - count)`, where `sub` is the difference between the length of the string `expression` and the number of `+` characters in it, and `count` is the number of `+` characters. This calculation does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Penalty Calculation Requirement**: According to the problem, the penalty for a single array `c` of length `m` is `p(c) = |c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m| * m`. The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: To achieve the minimum penalty, the optimal strategy is to split the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum of zero whenever possible. This means that for every `+` character, there should be a corresponding `-` character in the same subarray to cancel out its value.

4. **Implementation Issue**: The current implementation simply counts the number of `+` characters and calculates the difference between the length and this count, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation as required by the problem.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
