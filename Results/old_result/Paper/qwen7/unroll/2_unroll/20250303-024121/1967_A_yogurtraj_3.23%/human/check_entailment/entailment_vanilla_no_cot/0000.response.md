Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Maximum Score**: The logic in the provided code does not correctly calculate the maximum score. The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The current implementation seems to focus on redistributing the existing cards and buying additional ones but does not ensure the maximum score is achieved.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The problem requires maximizing the number of subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The current solution does not properly handle the redistribution and buying of cards to achieve this.

3. **Algorithmic Approach**: A more accurate approach would involve:
   - Identifying the longest prefix of the sequence that is already a permutation.
   - Using the remaining cards (both existing and bought) to extend this prefix to cover the entire array.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example input:
     ```
     3 4
     6 1 8
     ```
     The expected output is `15`, but the provided solution does not produce this result. The solution needs to consider how to optimally use the additional cards to form as many valid subarrays as possible.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem.
