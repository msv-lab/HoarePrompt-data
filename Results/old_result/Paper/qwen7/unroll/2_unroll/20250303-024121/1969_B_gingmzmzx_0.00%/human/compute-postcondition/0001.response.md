State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `n` which is used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. The variable `t` is not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.
