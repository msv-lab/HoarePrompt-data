Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function processes a binary string and counts certain conditions but does not account for the minimum cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string in non-descending order. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of transitions between 0 and 1 or vice versa, which is not equivalent to the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the minimum cost to make the binary string sorted. This involves identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculating the cost to move the remaining part of the string to its correct position through cyclic shifts.

Here's a more accurate approach:
1. Identify the longest prefix that is already sorted.
2. Calculate the cost to move the rest of the string to its correct position.

The provided function does not implement this logic, hence it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
