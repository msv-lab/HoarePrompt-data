### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads an integer `n` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and calculates the cost of operations needed to sort the string.
     - If the current character is 0, it increments the cost if there has been at least one 1 before it.
     - If the current character is 1, it adds the remaining zeros to the cost.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to be attempting to calculate the cost of operations to sort the string.
   - However, the approach does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts and their costs.
   - The logic for calculating the cost is flawed because it does not correctly account for the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the example "10", the program incorrectly outputs 2 instead of 1.
   - For "11000", the program incorrectly outputs 0 instead of 9.
   - For "101011", the program incorrectly outputs 5 instead of 9.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to accurately calculate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the binary string.

### Correctness:
**False**
