State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `test_cases` and the underscore `_`.
- The underscore `_` is a placeholder typically used when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.
- For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The value of `_` is automatically set to 0 at the start of the loop, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
