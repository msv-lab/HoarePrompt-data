The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of prices and bonuses for Alice and Bob. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible profit by strategically combining negative prices (from Alice) and bonuses (from Bob). It uses a heap to manage the items and updates the maximum profit found during the process. After processing all test cases, it prints the maximum profit obtained from any single test case.
