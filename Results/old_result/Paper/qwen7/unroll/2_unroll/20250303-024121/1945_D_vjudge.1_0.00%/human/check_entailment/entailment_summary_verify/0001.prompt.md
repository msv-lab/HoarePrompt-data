You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Function 2:
def func_2():

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases defined by `numero_testes`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. It iterates through `numero_testes` test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results based on the given inputs.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis
- **Objective**: Minimize the cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - To move from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`), Kirill pays `a_j` coins.
  - For each position `k` where `j < k < i`, Kirill pays `b_k` coins.
- **Constraints**:
  - The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and \(10^4\).
  - The size of the queue `n` and the maximum allowable final position `m` are between 1 and 200,000.
  - The values of `a_i` and `b_i` are between 1 and \(10^9\).

### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Reads and reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - Initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
   - Iterates over the first `n - k` elements:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - Initializes `resultado` to infinity.
   - Iterates over the last `k` elements:
     - Updates `resultado` with the minimum cost of moving to any of these positions.
     - Adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues Identified
1. **Reversing Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed before processing. This is incorrect because the problem states that Kirill should move to the left (smaller indices), not reverse the order.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. It does not correctly account for the cost of moving through intermediate positions.
3. **Incorrect Final Cost Calculation**: The final cost calculation is not correctly implemented. It should consider the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate from right to left (from the end of the queue to the start).
2. Maintain a running total of the cost of moving through intermediate positions.
3. Update the minimum cost for each position where Kirill can move to one of the first `m` positions.

### Corrected Program
```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize variables
    total_cost = 0
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate from right to left
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        total_cost += lista_B[i]
        if i + k <= n:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost + lista_A[i])
    
    print(min_cost)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the function to process the input
func_2()
```

### Conclusion
The original program has significant issues in both the logic and the implementation. The corrected approach addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem description.
