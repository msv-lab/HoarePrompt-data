Based on the initial state provided:

- `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1`.
- `n` and `k` are the same input integers.
- `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`.
- `resultado` is the minimum value obtained by adding `pref` and `soma_b` for each iteration.
- `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, with each integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the components:

1. **`soma_b`**: This is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1`. Since `lista_B` is in reverse order, the last `k` elements of `lista_B` will be summed up to get `soma_b`.

2. **`pref`**: This is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`. The corresponding elements in `lista_A` would be from index `0` to `k-1` because `lista_B` is reversed.

3. **`resultado`**: This is the minimum value obtained by adding `pref` and `soma_b` for each iteration. Since the exact values of `lista_A` and `lista_B` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `resultado`. However, we know it is derived from the sums `soma_b` and `pref`.

Given these details, the print statement will output the value of `resultado`, which is the minimum value obtained after performing the described operations.

Output: **resultado (where resultado is the minimum value obtained by adding pref and soma_b for each iteration)**
