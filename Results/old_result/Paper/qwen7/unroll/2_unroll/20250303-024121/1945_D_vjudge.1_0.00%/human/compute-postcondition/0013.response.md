Output State: `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1`, `n` is the same input integer, `k` is the same input integer, `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, `resultado` is the minimum value obtained by adding `pref` and `soma_b` for each iteration, and `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
