You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, lista_A is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and lista_B is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `soma_b` is 0, `n` is the same input integer, `k` is the same input integer, `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, and `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1`, `n` is the same input integer, `k` is the same input integer, `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, `resultado` is the minimum value obtained by adding `pref` and `soma_b` for each iteration, and `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value obtained by adding pref and soma_b for each iteration)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two lists, lista_A and lista_B, both containing n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and two positive integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000. It returns a specific value based on the conditions defined by n, k, lista_A, and lista_B.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
