Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `n` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `n` and `k`. If `n` equals `k`, no changes are made to `n` and `k`. If `n` is greater than `k`, the condition `k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1` holds true.
