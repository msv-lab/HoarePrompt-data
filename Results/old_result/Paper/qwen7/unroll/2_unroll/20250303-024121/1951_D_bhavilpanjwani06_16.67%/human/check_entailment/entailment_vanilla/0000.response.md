### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Basic Cases**:
   - If `n < k`, Alice cannot buy `k` jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. Therefore, the output should be "NO".
   - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by spending all her coins at one stall. Therefore, the output should be "YES" with 1 stall and the price equal to `n`.
3. **Intermediate Case**:
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it means Alice can buy `k-1` jewels at the first stall and then use the remaining coins to buy 1 jewel at another stall. This ensures she buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the output should be "YES" with 2 stalls, where the first stall has a price of `n - k + 1` and the second stall has a price of 1.
4. **General Case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it is impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the output should be "NO".

The provided solution seems to cover these cases correctly. However, let's verify the logic and edge cases:

- For `n < k`: The program correctly outputs "NO".
- For `n == k`: The program correctly outputs "YES" with 1 stall and the price equal to `n`.
- For `k - 1 < n - k + 1`: The program correctly outputs "YES" with 2 stalls, where the first stall has a price of `n - k + 1` and the second stall has a price of 1.
- For other cases: The program correctly outputs "NO".

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all cases correctly.

### Correctness:
