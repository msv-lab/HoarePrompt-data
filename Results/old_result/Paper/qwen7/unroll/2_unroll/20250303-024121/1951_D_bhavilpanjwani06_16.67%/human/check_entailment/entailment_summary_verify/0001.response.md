### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually using a loop.

2. **Basic Cases**:
   - If `n < k`, the program correctly outputs "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than required.
   - If `n == k`, the program correctly outputs "YES" with 1 stall and the price equal to `n`. This is also correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by spending all her coins at one stall.

3. **Intermediate Case**:
   - The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` needs careful consideration. This condition simplifies to `2k - 1 < n + 1`, which further simplifies to `2k < n + 2` or `k < (n + 2) / 2`. This means that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels at the first stall and use the remaining coins to buy 1 jewel at another stall. However, the current implementation only considers `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, which is not sufficient to cover all cases where `k` can be achieved.

4. **General Case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program correctly outputs "NO". This is correct because it covers all other scenarios where it is impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels.

However, the intermediate case condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios where `k` can be achieved. Specifically, the condition should be `k <= (n + 1) // 2` to ensure that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by distributing the coins optimally across stalls.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 10`, `k = 5`
- According to the current logic, since `5 - 1 < 10 - 5 + 1` is true (`4 < 6`), the program would output "YES" with 2 stalls, where the first stall has a price of `10 - 5 + 1 = 6` and the second stall has a price of `1`.

This is incorrect because Alice can actually buy exactly 5 jewels by setting up 5 stalls with prices `2, 2, 2, 2, 2` respectively. This satisfies the condition that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Corrected Logic:
To fix this, we need to consider the general case where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by distributing the coins optimally across stalls. The correct condition should be `k <= (n + 1) // 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k <= (n + 1) // 2:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print([n // k + 1] * (k - 1) + [n % k])
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not sufficient to cover all cases where `k` can be achieved. The corrected logic should consider `k <= (n + 1) // 2` to ensure Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.

Final: **False**
