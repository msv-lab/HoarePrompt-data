Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases where each test case includes three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, it processes these values but does not return any specific value explicitly mentioned in the given output cases.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, and k, and performs some operation based on these values. However, without explicit return statements provided in the output cases, the function's direct return value cannot be determined from the given information alone.
