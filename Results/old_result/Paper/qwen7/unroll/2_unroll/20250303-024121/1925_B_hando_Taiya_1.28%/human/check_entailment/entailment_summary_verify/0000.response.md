### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given example.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to split a problem of difficulty \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems such that the sum of their difficulties equals \( x \).
- The goal is to maximize the balance, defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

#### Given Program:
```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a series of test cases, each containing \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \).
- It calculates the maximum value between \( i \) and \( x // i \) for which either \( n \) is less than or equal to \( x // i \) or \( n \) is less than or equal to \( i \), where the loop iterates over \( i \) from 1 to the integer square root of \( x \).
- The function then prints this maximum value for each test case.

#### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor \).
2. **Divisors Check**: For each \( i \), it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( i \).
3. **Balance Calculation**: If \( n \leq x // i \), it considers \( i \) as a candidate for the GCD. If \( n \leq i \), it considers \( x // i \) as a candidate for the GCD.
4. **Max Value Update**: It updates the maximum balance found so far.

#### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: \( x = 10 \), \( n = 3 \)
  - Possible splits: \( [4, 2, 4] \) (GCD = 2)
  - The program correctly identifies \( 2 \) as the maximum balance.
  
- **Test Case 2**: \( x = 5 \), \( n = 5 \)
  - Possible split: \( [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \) (GCD = 1)
  - The program correctly identifies \( 1 \) as the maximum balance.
  
- **Test Case 3**: \( x = 420 \), \( n = 69 \)
  - Possible split: \( [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6,
