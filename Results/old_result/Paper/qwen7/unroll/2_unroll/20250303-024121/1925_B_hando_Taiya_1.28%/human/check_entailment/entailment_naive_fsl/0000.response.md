Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the number of sub-problems \( n \) is greater than the square root of \( x \). This leads to an incorrect calculation of the maximum balance.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
12 4
```

The expected output should be `3` because we can split the problem into difficulties `[3, 3, 3, 3]`, which gives a GCD of `3`.

However, the current implementation only checks divisibility up to the square root of \( x \), which may miss the optimal solution when \( n > \sqrt{x} \).

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where the number of sub-problems \( n \) is greater than the square root of \( x \) more comprehensively.
