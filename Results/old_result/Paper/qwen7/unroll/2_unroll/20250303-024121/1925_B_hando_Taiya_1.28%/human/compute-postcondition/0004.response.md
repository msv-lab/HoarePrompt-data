Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for which either `n` ≤ `x // i` or `n` ≤ `i`, where the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x`.
