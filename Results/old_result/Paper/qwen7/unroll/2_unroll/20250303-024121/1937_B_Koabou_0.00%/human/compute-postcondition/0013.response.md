Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string resulting from the loop's conditions, `x` is an integer indicating the position where the loop modified the string `s`. The value of `t` will be set to `x - i + 1` where `i` is the index when the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is met for the first time, otherwise `t` remains 1.
