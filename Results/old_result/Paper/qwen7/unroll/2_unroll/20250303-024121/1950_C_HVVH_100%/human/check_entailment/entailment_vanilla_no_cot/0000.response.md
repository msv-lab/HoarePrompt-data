Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program uses `input().split(':')` which splits the input but does not convert the parts to integers. This needs to be corrected to `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

2. **Handling Midnight and Noon**: The logic for handling midnight (`00:00`) and noon (`12:00`) is flawed. Specifically, when `h == 0`, it should be treated as `12 AM`. Similarly, when `h == 12`, it should be treated as `12 PM`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


func()
```

With these corrections, the program should work correctly according to the problem statement.
