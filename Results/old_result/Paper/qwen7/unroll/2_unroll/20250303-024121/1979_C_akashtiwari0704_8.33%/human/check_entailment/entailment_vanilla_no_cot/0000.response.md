Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The program calculates `a[i]` as `prod // a[i]`, which is not necessarily the correct approach. This calculation does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic to determine if the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome is flawed. The current implementation simply checks if `sumo >= prod`, which is not sufficient to guarantee the condition.

3. **Solution Existence**: The program does not correctly handle cases where a solution exists. For example, in the case where all multipliers are the same, the program incorrectly prints `-1`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Calculate the total product of all multipliers
        prod = 1
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        # Distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome
        ans = []
        for i in range(bets):
            # Bet a[i-1] * (prod // (a[i-1] * k[i])) - 1 to ensure the condition is met
            ans.append(prod // (a[i] * (bets - 1)) - 1)
        
        # Check if the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome
        total_bet = sum(ans)
        if any(total_bet >= a[i] * ans[i] for i in range(bets)):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome by distributing the bets appropriately.
