Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `k` of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.**
