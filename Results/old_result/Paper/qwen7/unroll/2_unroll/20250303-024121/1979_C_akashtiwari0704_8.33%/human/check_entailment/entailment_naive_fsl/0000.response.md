Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the bets does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
3
3 2 7
```
- Expected Output:
```
27 41 12
```
- Actual Output:
```
27 21 12
```

The program calculates the bets as `prod // a[i]` for each `a[i]`, but this approach does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. For example, with the inputs `3 2 7`, the calculated bets are `27, 21, 12`, which do not satisfy the condition for the second outcome (since `27 + 21 + 12 = 60` and `2 * 21 = 42`, which is not strictly greater than 60).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
