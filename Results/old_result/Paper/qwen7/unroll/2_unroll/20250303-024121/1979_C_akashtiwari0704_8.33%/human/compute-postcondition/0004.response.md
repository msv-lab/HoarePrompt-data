Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of bets (`bets`), a list of integers (`a`), calculates the product of the list elements (`prod`), and then updates each element in the list by dividing `prod` by the respective element and summing these updated values (`sumo`). If the sum of the updated list is greater than or equal to the original product, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the updated list as a space-separated string. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each test case containing up to 50 integers in the list, where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive.**
