Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the sorting step is incorrect. According to the problem description, the columns should be sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position. However, the program sorts the details in the order of balance, position, and character, which does not align with the required criteria.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The expected balanced shuffle is `()(()())`, but the program will produce a different result because it does not correctly handle the sorting step. The correct implementation would involve sorting the details based on the balance and position as specified, ensuring that the final sequence respects the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.
