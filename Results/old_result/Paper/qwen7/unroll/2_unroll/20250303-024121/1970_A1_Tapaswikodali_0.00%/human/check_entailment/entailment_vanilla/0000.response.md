Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input, which is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence.
   
2. **Computing Prefix Balances:**
   - A list `details` is initialized to store tuples of (prefix balance, position, character).
   - For each character in the string `s`, the balance is updated accordingly:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - Each character is appended to `details` along with its negative position (to handle sorting in descending order when balances are equal).

3. **Sorting Details:**
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the prefix balance (ascending order). In case of ties, the characters with higher original positions are placed first (due to the negative position used in sorting).

4. **Constructing Result:**
   - The characters are extracted from the sorted `details` list and joined to form the resulting balanced shuffle string `result`.

5. **Printing Result:**
   - The `result` string is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Balanced Parentheses Sequence:**
  - The input is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, so the initial balance will always start at 0 and end at 0, ensuring the input is valid.

- **Prefix Balance Calculation:**
  - The balance calculation is done correctly, and the details list captures the necessary information for sorting.

- **Sorting Logic:**
  - The sorting logic ensures that the sequence is sorted by prefix balance and then by position, which is crucial for generating the correct balanced shuffle.

- **Result Construction:**
  - The construction of the result by joining the characters from the sorted list is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
