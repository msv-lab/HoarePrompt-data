Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The key issue lies in how the positions are handled during sorting. The program uses `-i` to store the position in the details list, but it should use the actual position `i` to ensure that when sorting, the positions are considered in decreasing order in case of a tie in prefix balance.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of the prefix up to each character.
2. **Details List Construction**: The program appends tuples `(balance, -i, char)` to the details list. Using `-i` instead of `i` for positions means that when sorting, the positions will be sorted in reverse order, which is incorrect.
3. **Sorting**: Sorting the details list using `details.sort()` will reorder the characters based on their calculated balances and reversed positions, which does not align with the required logic of sorting by prefix balance and then by position.
4. **Result Construction**: The program reconstructs the result by joining the characters from the sorted details list, but since the positions were incorrectly handled, the resulting sequence will not be the correct balanced shuffle.

To fix this, the program should use `i` instead of `-i` for the positions in the details list. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
