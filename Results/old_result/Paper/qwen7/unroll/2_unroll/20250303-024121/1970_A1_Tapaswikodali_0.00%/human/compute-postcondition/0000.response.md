Output State: **`s` is an input string of a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")"**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")", this property is preserved. The length of `s` does not exceed 500,000, which is also maintained. Therefore, the output state is that `s` is still a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
