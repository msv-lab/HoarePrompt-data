Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99). For each test case, it checks if the integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) is provided implicitly through the input structure and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations inside the function.
