The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. Since the initial values of `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, after executing the code, these values will be updated to the integers provided as input. The variables `x` and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the first integer input, `m` is updated to the second integer input, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0.**
