Output State: The output state will consist of multiple pairs of lines, each pair corresponding to the output of one iteration of the loop. For each iteration:

1. Two lists (`ans1` and `ans2`) are printed.
2. `ans1` contains elements from the first half of the sorted array `b`, and `ans2` contains elements from the second half of the sorted array `c`.
3. Elements are added to `ans1` and `ans2` based on the conditions in the loop, ensuring that no element is repeated more than necessary to meet the requirement of using up `k` elements (where `k` is initially twice the value of `k` provided in the input).

Each line of output will contain space-separated integers representing the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for that particular iteration.
