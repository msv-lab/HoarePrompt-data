Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of 2n integers (array a) where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k (satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). It returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instructions.
