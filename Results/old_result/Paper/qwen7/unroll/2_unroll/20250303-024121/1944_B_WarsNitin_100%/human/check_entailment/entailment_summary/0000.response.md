Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. It splits the input array into two halves, `b` and `c`, corresponding to the first and second halves of the original array, respectively.
3. The program sorts both halves, which helps in identifying patterns and constructing the required subsets.
4. The logic for constructing `ans1` and `ans2` seems to ensure that the XOR of elements in `ans1` matches the XOR of elements in `ans2`. This is achieved by carefully selecting elements from the sorted halves, ensuring that no element is used more than necessary.
5. The program handles the case where the first and last elements of the sorted halves might be unique and adds them to the result if needed.
6. The construction of `ans1` and `ans2` ensures that they are subsets of the respective halves and have the required length.
7. The program prints the constructed lists for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description and execution summary accurately.

Correctness: **True**
