Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the string `n` and the binary string `a`.

2. **Calculation of Midpoint**: The midpoint `pk` is calculated correctly as `n // 2` when `n` is even, and `n // 2` is used for odd `n` as well, which is fine since the exact midpoint is not needed for the logic.

3. **Counting Zeros and Ones**: The program counts the number of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`) in the string correctly.

4. **Iterating Through the String**: The program iterates through the string from index 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) to calculate the percentage of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the current position.

5. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks if the percentage of '0's and '1's on both sides is at least 50%. This is done using `math.ceil` to round up the percentages.

6. **Finding Optimal Position**: The program collects all valid positions in the list `lst` and then finds the position closest to `pk`. If multiple positions have the same minimum distance, it selects the smallest one.

7. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where no valid position is found by checking the overall percentage of '1's in the string. If the percentage of '1's is less than 50%, it appends either 0 or `n` to the `final` list, ensuring a valid output.

8. **Output**: The program prints the optimal position for each test case, which is the smallest position that satisfies the conditions.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
