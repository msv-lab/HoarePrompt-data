Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*costs)
   ```

Given that `n` is 0, let's evaluate the expression for `h`:
- `n // (n - k + 1)` becomes `0 // (0 - k + 1)`, which is `0 // (-k + 1)`. Since division by zero is undefined, this part of the expression is invalid and would typically raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if evaluated directly. However, since the problem specifies that `h` is defined and greater than or equal to `k`, we need to consider the context where this expression might be valid or handled differently.

Given the precondition that `h` is defined and greater than or equal to `k`, and considering the typical behavior in such problems, it implies that the expression `n // (n - k + 1)` is likely handled in a way that avoids division by zero, possibly resulting in 0 or another valid value. But since the actual value of `costs` is not provided, we cannot determine its contents.

Therefore, the `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list, but without knowing the contents of `costs`, we can only state that it will print whatever elements are in `costs`.

Output: **[] (assuming costs is an empty list)**

If `costs` contains any elements, they will be printed as a space-separated list. Without further information, the most precise answer based on the given precondition is that `costs` is an empty list.
