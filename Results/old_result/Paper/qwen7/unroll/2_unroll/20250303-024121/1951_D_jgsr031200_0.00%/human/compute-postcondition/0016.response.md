Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - Since `n` is 0, let's evaluate the expression for `h`:
     - `n // (n - k + 1)`: This expression involves division by zero if `k` is 1 because `n - k + 1` becomes `-1`, and division by zero is undefined. However, since `n` is 0, this part of the expression evaluates to 0 (as any number divided by a non-zero number is 0, and 0 divided by a non-zero number is also 0).
     - `n // 1`: This is simply `0 // 1`, which equals 0.
   - Therefore, `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - It is given that `h` is less than `k`. Since `h` is 0, this condition is satisfied regardless of the value of `k` (as long as `k` is greater than 0).

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
