Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires Bob to set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys jewels greedily, meaning she buys from the lowest priced stall first until she runs out of coins or reaches the end of the stalls.

### Given Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, k):
       if n == k:
           print('YES')
           print(1)
           print(1)
           return
       if n < k:
           print('NO')
           return
       costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
       h = 0
       for i in costs:
           curr = n // i
           h += curr
           n -= i * curr
       if h < k:
           print('NO')
       else:
           print(2)
           print('YES')
           print(*costs)
   ```
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price `1`.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it attempts to find a configuration of stalls and prices.
     - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
     - It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each price level and sums them up.
     - If the sum is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with the calculated prices.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` only handles the case where `n == k` by setting up 1 stall with price `1`. This is a special case but not sufficient for general handling.
   - For other cases, the logic to determine the number of stalls and their prices is flawed. The current approach assumes only 2 stalls, which is too restrictive and may not always work.

2. **General Solution Requirement:**
   - The problem requires setting up at most 60 stalls, and the solution should handle all possible configurations within this constraint.
   - The current implementation does not explore all possible configurations of stalls and prices.

3. **Greedy Approach Limitations:**
   - The greedy approach used in the given code may not always lead to the correct solution. Alice's buying pattern needs to be carefully managed to ensure she buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
