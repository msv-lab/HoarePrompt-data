Output State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list. Initially, the first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`. In each iteration, `curr` is set to `n` divided by the current element in `costs`, then `h` is incremented by `curr` and `n` is decreased by `i * curr`. Since `n` is always reduced by a value derived from itself, it will eventually reach 0. The final value of `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, both of which are integers.
