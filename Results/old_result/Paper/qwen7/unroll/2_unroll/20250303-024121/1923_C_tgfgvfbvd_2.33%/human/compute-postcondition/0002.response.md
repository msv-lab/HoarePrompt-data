Output State: The program will execute a series of test cases. For each test case, it will first read two integers \(n\) and \(m\), then a list of \(n\) integers \(l\). It will compute a prefix sum list \(p\) from the list \(l\). Then, for each of the \(m\) queries, it will read two integers \(a\) and \(b\), and determine whether the sum of elements in the sublist \(l_{a-1}\) to \(l_{b-1}\) is at least twice the length of the sublist. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, the output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each query across all test cases.
