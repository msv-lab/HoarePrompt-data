You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

    #State: Output State: The program will execute a series of test cases. For each test case, it will first read two integers \(n\) and \(m\), then a list of \(n\) integers \(l\). It will compute a prefix sum list \(p\) from the list \(l\). Then, for each of the \(m\) queries, it will read two integers \(a\) and \(b\), and determine whether the sum of elements in the sublist \(l_{a-1}\) to \(l_{b-1}\) is at least twice the length of the sublist. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, the output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each query across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), followed by a list of \(n\) integers \(l\). It computes a prefix sum list \(p\) from the list \(l\). Then, for each of the \(m\) queries, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\), and determines whether the sum of elements in the sublist from index \(a-1\) to \(b-1\) is at least twice the length of the sublist. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, the function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each query across all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray, which is not sufficient to guarantee that the subarray is good. 

To illustrate, consider the following subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` from the example input. The subarray from index 1 to 3 (`[2, 1, 4]`) has a sum of `7` and a length of `3`. According to the program's logic, since `7 >= 2 * 3`, it would incorrectly print 'YES'. However, a valid `b` array for this subarray could be `[3, 1, 3]`, where all conditions are satisfied, but the program fails to check if such a `b` array exists.

A correct approach would involve generating a possible `b` array for the subarray and checking if it satisfies all conditions, rather than just checking the sum condition.
