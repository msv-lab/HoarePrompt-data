You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The program will execute a series of test cases. For each test case, it will first read two integers \(n\) and \(m\), then a list of \(n\) integers \(l\). It will compute a prefix sum list \(p\) from the list \(l\). Then, for each of the \(m\) queries, it will read two integers \(a\) and \(b\), and determine whether the sum of elements in the sublist \(l_{a-1}\) to \(l_{b-1}\) is at least twice the length of the sublist. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, the output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each query across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case involving a positive integer `t`, a list of `n` positive integers `c`, and `q` queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it checks the sum of elements in the sublist from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) of list `c` and returns the count of queries for which the sum is even.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
