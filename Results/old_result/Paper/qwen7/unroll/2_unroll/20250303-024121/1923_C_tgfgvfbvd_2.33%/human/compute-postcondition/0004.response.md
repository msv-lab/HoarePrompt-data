Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), followed by a list of \(n\) integers \(l\). It computes a prefix sum list \(p\) from the list \(l\). Then, for each of the \(m\) queries, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\), and determines whether the sum of elements in the sublist from index \(a-1\) to \(b-1\) is at least twice the length of the sublist. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, the function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each query across all test cases.**
