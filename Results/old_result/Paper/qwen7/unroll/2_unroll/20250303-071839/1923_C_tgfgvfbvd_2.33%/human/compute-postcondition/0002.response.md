Output State: The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it first reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), then an array \(l\) of length \(n\). It calculates a prefix sum array \(p\) where each element \(p[i]\) is the sum of the first \(i+1\) elements of \(l\). Then, for each of the \(m\) queries, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\), and determines whether the sum of the subarray from index \(a-1\) to \(b-1\) is at least twice the length of this subarray. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The output state includes the results of all these queries for each test case.
