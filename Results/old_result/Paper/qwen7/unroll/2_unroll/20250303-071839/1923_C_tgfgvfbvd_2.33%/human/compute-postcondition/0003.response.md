Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs consisting of a positive integer `t`, followed by `n` and `q` (where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5), an array `c` of length `n` with each element being a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. For each query, it returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` in the array `c`.**
