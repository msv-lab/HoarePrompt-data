The function accepts a string `s1` and an integer `n`, and calculates and prints a list of integers `ans` based on the positions of '>' characters in `s1`. For each position `i` in `s1`, `ans[i]` contains a value calculated based on the number of '>' characters to the left and the number of positions to the right. The function modifies the input string `s1` and constructs the list `ans` which is printed at the end.
