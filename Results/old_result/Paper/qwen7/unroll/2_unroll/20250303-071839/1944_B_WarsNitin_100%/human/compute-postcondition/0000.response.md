Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. All other variables remain unchanged.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, while the conditions for `n` and `k` and the list `a` remain unaltered.
