Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `f` is 1, `x` is a string of digits, `y` is a string of digits, `a` is a list of characters from `x` sorted in non-decreasing order compared to the corresponding characters in `b`, `b` is a list of characters from `y`.

Explanation: The loop compares each character in list `a` with the corresponding character in list `b`. If the character in `a` is less than the character in `b`, it swaps them and sets `f` to 1. If the character in `a` is greater than the character in `b`, it sets `f` to 1. If `f` is 1 at the end of the loop, it means there was at least one swap, indicating that the lists `a` and `b` were not already in the desired order. The lists `a` and `b` will be sorted in such a way that for every pair of elements, the element from `a` is not greater than the corresponding element from `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i], end='')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
