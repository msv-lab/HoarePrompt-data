Functionality: **The function takes two strings of equal length consisting of digits from 1 to 9 as input, converts them into lists of characters, and sorts the first list (`a`) in non-decreasing order compared to the corresponding characters in the second list (`b`). If any swaps occur during the sorting process, it indicates that the original lists were not in the desired order. The function then prints the sorted list `a` followed by the original list `b` character by character. The function does not return any value.**
