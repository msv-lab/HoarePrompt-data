Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair during the excursions.

The program assumes that each pair is chosen with equal probability, but it does not consider the actual probabilities based on the number of pairs and the fact that the teacher chooses pairs randomly and independently. The expected value calculation should take into account the probability of selecting each pair, which is not correctly implemented in the `func_1` function.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the probability of selecting each pair and then use these probabilities to compute the expected value. The current implementation only considers the friendship values without accounting for the selection probabilities.
