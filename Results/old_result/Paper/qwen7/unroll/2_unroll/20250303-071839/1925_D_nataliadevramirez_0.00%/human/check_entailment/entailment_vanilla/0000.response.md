Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The result should be calculated modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes parameters \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and a list of friendships.
   - It iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution to the result based on the number of excursions \( k \).
   - The formula used is \( f \times \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), which is the expected number of times a friendship value will increase over \( k \) excursions.
   - The result is taken modulo \( MOD \) (which is \( 10^9 + 7 \)).

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It then reads the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Formula Used:**
   - The formula \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \) is correct for calculating the expected number of times a friendship value will increase over \( k \) excursions.
   - This formula assumes that each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently, which aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) is correct as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no friendships (as seen in the first test case).
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases.

4. **Implementation:**
   - The implementation seems to follow the logic correctly without any apparent errors.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
