Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of k integers sorted in strictly increasing order, and `b` is a list of q integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive. If the condition is met that each element in `a` is not less than or equal to any element in `b`, the function returns the list `b`. Otherwise, it returns a new list where each element of `a` is decremented by 1.**
