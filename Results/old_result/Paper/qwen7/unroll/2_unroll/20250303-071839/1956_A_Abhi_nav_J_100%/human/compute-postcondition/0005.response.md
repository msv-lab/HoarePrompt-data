Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `a` and `b`. List `a` contains `k` integers sorted in strictly increasing order, and list `b` contains `q` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive. If every element in `a` is greater than or equal to every element in `b`, the function returns list `b`. Otherwise, it returns a new list where each element of `a` is decremented by 1.**
