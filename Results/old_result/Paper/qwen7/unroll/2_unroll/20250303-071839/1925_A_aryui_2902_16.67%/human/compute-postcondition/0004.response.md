Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` represents the number of repetitions and `k` is the length of the substring to be taken from the string `s`. It then returns a new string consisting of the substring of `s` from index 0 to `k` (inclusive), repeated `n` times.**
