Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head consists of the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will iterate based on the input value provided by the user.

2. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the input value must be a positive integer. Since the variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the loop (it's typically used to iterate over the range without needing the actual index), the only variable that directly affects the loop's execution is the input value itself.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is already set to a valid value before the loop starts.

Given these points, the only thing that needs adjustment is ensuring that the input value is within the specified range and that the loop can execute based on this input.

**State after adjustment**:
- The input value must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value.

**State:**
**`input()` must return a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4**
