Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to find a way to split the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) such that the total penalty \(p(s) + p(t)\) is minimized. However, the logic within the loops is flawed and does not achieve this goal.

Here's an example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
5
4
2 1 3 4
```

The correct minimum penalty should be 1, which can be achieved by splitting the array into \(s = [2, 4]\) and \(t = [1, 3]\). However, the program will not correctly handle this case and will likely produce an incorrect result.

The program tries to find a maximum value and update variables `a` and `b` based on certain conditions, but it does not properly calculate the penalties for the subsequences \(s\) and \(t\). Instead, it seems to be attempting to find a way to maximize the difference between consecutive elements, which is not relevant to the problem.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
