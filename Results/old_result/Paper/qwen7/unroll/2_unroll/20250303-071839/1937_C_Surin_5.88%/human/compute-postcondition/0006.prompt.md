You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This is an interactive problem with no explicit input variables in the function signature. However, the precondition includes the existence of a secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \), which is a permutation of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \), and the ability to make up to \( 3n \) queries comparing bitwise OR results to deduce the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of two main parts. First, for each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `kp`), the code will determine the relative order of elements using comparisons. Specifically, it will identify two indices, `prev` and `v1`, which represent the positions of the smallest and second smallest elements in the array, respectively. Second, the code will output these indices in the format `! prev v1`. After all iterations, the output state will contain these pairs of indices for each `kp` value, indicating the relative ordering of the smallest and second smallest elements found during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, where \(p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\) is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). The function achieves this by making up to \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
