Precondition: **This is an interactive problem with no explicit input variables in the function signature. However, the precondition includes the existence of a secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \), which is a permutation of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \), and the ability to make up to \( 3n \) queries comparing bitwise OR results to deduce the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.**
