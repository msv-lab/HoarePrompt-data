Output State: **The existence of a secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) which is a permutation of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) is maintained; the function I is defined to take input as a list of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `I` that takes input from the user, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. However, since there are no variables being assigned values within this code snippet, the only thing that changes is the definition of the function `I`. The secret permutation and its properties remain unchanged.
