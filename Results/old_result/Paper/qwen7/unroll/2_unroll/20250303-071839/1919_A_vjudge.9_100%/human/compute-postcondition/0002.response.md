Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing either "Bob" or "Alice", depending on the input pairs (a, b) provided during the execution of the loop. Specifically, for each pair (a, b), if the absolute difference between a and b is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". The total number of lines will be equal to the value of t, which is the input integer between 1 and 1000.
