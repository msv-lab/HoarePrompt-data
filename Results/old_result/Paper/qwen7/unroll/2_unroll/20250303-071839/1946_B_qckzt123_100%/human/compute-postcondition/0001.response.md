Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `MOD` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
