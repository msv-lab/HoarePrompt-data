Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the sum of the array \( a \) and a modified version of the maximum subarray sum, then applies a series of modular arithmetic operations. Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the calculated value modulo \( 1000000007 \).**
