Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the input password.
2. It sorts the digits and letters separately.
3. It then checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, which ensures that no digit comes after a letter.
4. It also checks if the sorted combination of digits followed by letters matches the original password, ensuring that all digits are in non-decreasing order and all letters are in non-decreasing order.
5. The main program iterates over each test case, calls `func_1`, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the return value of `func_1`.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the function `func_1` and the main program logic are correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
