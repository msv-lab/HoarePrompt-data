### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` to determine if it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password according to the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a password string and separates its characters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It then sorts both lists.
   - After sorting, it checks if the sorted combination of digits and letters matches the original password.
   - If the sorted combination matches the original password, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** Password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. (This is handled by the input format and the separation logic.)
   - **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. (This is checked by ensuring that the last digit is less than or equal to any preceding letter.)
   - **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. (This is ensured by sorting the `digits` list and checking if the sorted list matches the original `digits` list.)
   - **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. (This is ensured by sorting the `letters` list and checking if the sorted list matches the original `letters` list.)

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles passwords with only digits or only letters.
   - The function correctly handles passwords where digits come before letters and vice versa.
   - The function correctly handles passwords where digits and letters are interspersed and need to be sorted separately.

4. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The test cases provided in the example correctly reflect the behavior of the function:
     - "12ac" is valid because digits and letters are sorted.
     - "123wa" is invalid because the digits are sorted but the letter "w" comes after the digit "3".
     - "allllmost" is valid because letters are sorted.
     - "ac123" is invalid because the digit "1" comes after the letter "c".
     - "011679" is valid because digits are sorted.

Based on the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the conditions for a strong password. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
