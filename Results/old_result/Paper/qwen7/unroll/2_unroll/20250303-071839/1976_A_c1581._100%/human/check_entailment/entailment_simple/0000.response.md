Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. For each password, it separates the characters into `digits` and `letters`.
3. It sorts the `digits` and `letters` separately.
4. It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order and if the last digit is not greater than any letter.
5. It constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters`.
6. It compares the constructed password with the original password to ensure they match.
7. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the password meets all the specified conditions:
   - No digit comes after a letter.
   - All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
