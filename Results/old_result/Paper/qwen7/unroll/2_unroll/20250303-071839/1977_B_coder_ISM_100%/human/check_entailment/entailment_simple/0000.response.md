Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array of integers `[a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]` where each element is either `-1`, `0`, or `1`, such that the sum equals the given integer `x`. Additionally, no two consecutive non-zero elements are allowed.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x` and initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation.
   - It constructs the binary representation of `x` using bitwise operations, appending `'1'` or `'0'` to `s` based on whether the bit at position `i` is set in `x`.
   - It then processes the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. This is done by checking for consecutive `1`s and converting one of them to `-1` and setting a flag to indicate that a change has been made.
   - If the last element is `0` and a change was made, it adjusts the last element to `1` and increments the length.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the list and the list itself.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the last element is `0` and a change was made by adjusting the last element to `1` and incrementing the length.
   - The program ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist, which satisfies the problem constraints.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly constructs the binary representation of `x`.
   - The processing step ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
