Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` will retain this property. All other variables remain unchanged.
