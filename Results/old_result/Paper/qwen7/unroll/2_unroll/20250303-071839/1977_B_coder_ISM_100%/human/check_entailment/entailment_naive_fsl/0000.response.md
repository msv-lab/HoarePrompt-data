Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate a valid array according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the input `x` is a power of 2. For such cases, the generated array may violate the condition that there does not exist an index `0 ≤ i ≤ n - 2` such that both `a_{i} ≠ 0` and `a_{i + 1} ≠ 0`.

For example, consider the input `x = 8`. The correct output should be `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, but the program generates `[1, 0, 0, 0]` instead, which violates the condition because it has consecutive non-zero elements (`1` and `0`).

Here is a specific example to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `8`
- Expected Output: 
```
4
0 0 0 1
```
- Actual Output from the Program:
```
4
1 0 0 0
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the case where `x` is a power of 2, thus failing to meet the problem description requirements in all cases.
