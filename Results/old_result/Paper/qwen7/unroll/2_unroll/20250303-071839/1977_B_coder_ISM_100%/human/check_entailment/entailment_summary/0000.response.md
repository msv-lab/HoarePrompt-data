Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. It converts the integer \(x\) into its 30-bit binary representation, storing the bits in a list `s`.
3. The program then iterates through the bits to apply transformations based on specific conditions:
   - If a bit is '1' and the next bit is also '1', it changes the current bit to '-1'.
   - If a '1' bit is followed by a '0' bit and a flag is set, it changes the current bit to '0'.
   - It ensures no two consecutive non-zero bits exist.
4. After applying these transformations, it adjusts the length of the list `s` if necessary and prints the length and the modified list.
5. The transformations ensure that the resulting binary string meets the problem's requirements:
   - The sum of the modified binary string equals \(x\).
   - There are no two consecutive non-zero bits.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and the execution summary accurately reflects the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
