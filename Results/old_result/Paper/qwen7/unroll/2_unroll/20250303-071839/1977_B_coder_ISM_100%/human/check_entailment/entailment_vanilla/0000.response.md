Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s`.
   - It iterates from `0` to `29` (since `2^30` is the upper limit), checking if the `i-th` bit of `x` is set (`1`) or not (`0`).
   - This part is correct and ensures that the binary representation of `x` is stored in `s`.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints:**
   - The program then iterates through the bits of `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits exist.
   - If a `1` is found, it checks if the next bit is also `1`. If so, it changes the current bit to `-1` and sets a flag.
   - If the flag is set and the current bit is `0`, it changes the current bit to `1`.
   - These adjustments are designed to ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits exist, which is correct.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the last bit might need adjustment and ensures the final result meets the constraints.
   - If the last bit is `0` and the flag is set, it changes the last bit to `1` and increments the length.
   - If the flag is still set, it appends a `1` to the end of the list and increments the length.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the resulting list `s` and then prints the list itself.
   - This output format matches the required format specified in the problem statement.

### Verification

Given the problem constraints and the steps outlined above, the program appears to correctly generate an array `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` that satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The program logic is sound and adheres to the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
