Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the output state remains consistent with this condition. The other conditions for `n` and `k_i` remain unaffected by this code snippet.
