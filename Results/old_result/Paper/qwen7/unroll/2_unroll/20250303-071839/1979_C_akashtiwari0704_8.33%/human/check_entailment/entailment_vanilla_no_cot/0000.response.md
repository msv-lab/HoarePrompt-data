Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `prod`:**
   - The variable `prod` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k_i`. However, the problem requires that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Therefore, `prod` should not be the product of all multipliers but rather the smallest multiplier, because betting on the smallest multiplier will ensure the condition is met more easily.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Condition:**
   - The program calculates `sumo` as the sum of `a[i]` which is `prod // a[i]`. This logic does not correctly reflect the requirement that the total bet must be strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. Instead, it should directly check if the sum of the bets is less than the smallest multiplier.

3. **Incorrect Output Format:**
   - The program prints the bets in a format that includes spaces between numbers, but the problem statement does not specify this format. The output should simply list the bets separated by spaces without additional characters.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Find the smallest multiplier
        min_multiplier = min(a)
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible bet for each outcome
        bets = [min_multiplier - 1] * bets
        
        # Check if the total bet is less than the smallest multiplier
        total_bet = sum(bets)
        if total_bet >= min_multiplier:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ' '.join(map(str, bets))
            print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program:
- Finds the smallest multiplier.
- Sets the bet for each outcome to `min_multiplier - 1`.
- Checks if the total bet is less than the smallest multiplier.
- Outputs the bets in the required format.
