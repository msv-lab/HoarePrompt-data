### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program follows the necessary steps to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest available pair of numbers. Let's break down the key points again to ensure the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of integers for each test case.
   - It then reads the list of integers and converts them to a list of integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order, ensuring that the smallest numbers are processed first.

3. **Scoring Mechanism:**
   - The while loop iterates over the sorted list, popping the first two elements in each iteration.
   - The minimum of these two elements is added to the score, ensuring that the smallest possible values are always used.

4. **Output:**
   - The total score is printed for each test case.

Given the problem description and the function summary, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest available pair of numbers. The sorting step ensures that the smallest elements are always chosen first, and the while loop ensures that all possible pairs are considered.

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly follows the required steps to achieve the maximum score.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
