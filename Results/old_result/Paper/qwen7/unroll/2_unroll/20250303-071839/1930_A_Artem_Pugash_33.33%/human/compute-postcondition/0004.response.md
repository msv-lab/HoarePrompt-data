Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the number of pairs, followed by `2n` integers. It sorts these integers and then iterates through them in pairs, summing up the minimum value of each pair. Finally, it prints the total sum for all test cases.**
