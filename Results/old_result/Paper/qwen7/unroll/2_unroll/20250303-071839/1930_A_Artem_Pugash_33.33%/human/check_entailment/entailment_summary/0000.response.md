Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score according to the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers. It then sorts this list in ascending order.
3. **Pairwise Minimum Summation**: After sorting, the program iterates through the sorted list in pairs, popping the first two elements (which are the smallest remaining elements), calculates their minimum, and adds it to the total score. This ensures that the smallest available numbers are always paired together, maximizing the score.
4. **Output**: The total score is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the steps taken by the program, it correctly computes the maximum possible score by always pairing the smallest available numbers.

Correctness: **True**
