Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `numCases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: 
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: 
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < numCases`.
   - Therefore, `numCases` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial state of `t` (which is between 1 and 5000) does not affect whether the loop can execute.
   - The initial state of `i` is 0.
   - `numCases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `numCases`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `numCases` must be greater than 0**
