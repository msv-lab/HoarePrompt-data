Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is used to iterate over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on each character in the string `s` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `s`: This is the string that `i` iterates over. It is given that `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over. Therefore, the loop will execute if `s` is non-empty.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `s` is a string of length `m` and it is non-empty (otherwise the loop would not execute), we need to ensure that `s` is non-empty.
   - The variable `i` will start from the first character of `s` and will change with each iteration, but its initial value is not specified in the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it specifically for the loop to start.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must be a non-empty string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `i` will start from the first character of `s` and change with each iteration, but no specific initial value is needed for the loop to start.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, alphabet is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**.
