### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to issues in the `func_1` function and the assumptions made in constructing the result string. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to verify the correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function aims to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` and appends it to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` becomes an empty set, it appends the current character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to the full set of `k` alphabets.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - Finally, it returns a tuple indicating whether `s1` is at least `n * k` characters long, `s1` sliced from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks the result.
   - If `func_1` returns `(False, ..., ...)`, it prints "No" and constructs a string `be9i` using the first `k` alphabets that is not present in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `(True, ..., ...)`, it prints "Yes".

#### Detailed Verification:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle edge cases like when `s` is very short or when `n` is large compared to `k`.
   - The function `func_1` should correctly identify if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.

2. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are checked.
   - The variable `s1` accumulates characters from `s` that are in the first `k` alphabets, but it does not guarantee that all combinations of these characters are present.
   - The slicing and resetting of `alphabet` might miss some combinations.

3. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The construction of `be9i` assumes that `s1` is missing some combination, but this assumption might not hold true for all cases.

#### Correctness of the Program:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly solve the problem because the function `func_1` does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are checked. Additionally, the construction of the result string `be9i` is based on assumptions that might not always hold true.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
