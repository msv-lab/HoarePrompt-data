Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each involving a permutation of integers. For each test case, it queries the relative order between pairs of indices using a hypothetical comparison oracle. It determines the final value of `mak2` and the last element in the list `pans` that satisfies the condition of being equal to or greater than `mak2`. The function then outputs these two values, representing the final determined order of the permutation for each test case.**
