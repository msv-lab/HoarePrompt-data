Output State: The output state consists of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents `mak2`, which is the value of `mak` after the second loop completes. The second integer is the value of `pans[mak]`, which is the last element added to the list `pans` that satisfies the condition in the third loop.

In simpler terms, the output state will contain the final value of `mak2` and the position in the permutation array `pans` that was determined to be the largest after all comparisons were made.
