Output State: **`x` is 1**

The initial state indicates that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, and the square root of `n` is less than or equal to the maximum possible value that `x` can take during the loop iterations. The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `x`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `x` is now `1`.
