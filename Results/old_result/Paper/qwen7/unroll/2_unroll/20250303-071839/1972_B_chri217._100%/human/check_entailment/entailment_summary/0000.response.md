Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins (facing up or down) and the rules of the game. The game is played optimally by both players, and the outcome depends on the parity (even or odd) of the number of coins facing up initially.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins (`n`) and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It correctly constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer `n` and the string `s`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a tuple `case` as input, which contains the number of coins `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`, which represents the number of coins facing up.
   - It returns 'YES' if the count of "U" is even, indicating that Alice will win, and 'NO' if the count is odd, indicating that Bob will win.
   - This logic aligns with the problem statement, as the game's outcome depends on whether the number of coins facing up is even or odd.

4. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case returned by `func_1` and calls `func_2` for each case.
   - The results from `func_2` are printed, which matches the required output format.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
