### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the input and stores the test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `(n, s)` for each test case.
   - **Correct**: The function `func_1` correctly parses the input and organizes it as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of coins that are facing up (`ups`).
   - The function checks if the count of facing-up coins (`ups`) is even. If it is even, it returns `'YES'`, indicating that Alice will win; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.
   - **Incorrect**: The function `func_2` only considers the parity of the number of facing-up coins without accounting for the actual game mechanics. The problem statement specifies that the game involves removing coins and flipping adjacent coins, which means the game state evolves over multiple steps. The simple parity check does not capture the complex interplay of moves and the resulting game state.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - According to the problem statement, the game involves a series of operations where a player removes a facing-up coin and flips its adjacent coins. The game continues until there are no more facing-up coins.
   - The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the sequence of moves and the resulting state of the coins after each operation.
   - The provided implementation in `func_2` only checks the initial number of facing-up coins, which is insufficient to determine the winner because the game state changes with each move.

4. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The logic implemented in `func_2` does not correctly simulate the game's progression and thus cannot accurately predict the winner based on the given rules.
   - The solution fails to account for the dynamic nature of the game and the sequence of moves, which are crucial for determining the winner.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. The program only checks the initial parity of the number of facing-up coins, which is insufficient to determine the winner due to the dynamic nature of the game.

### Final:
**False**
