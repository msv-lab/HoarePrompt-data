Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum balance (GCD) of \( n \) sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to \( x \).
2. The provided code attempts to find the maximum balance by iterating through potential divisors of \( x \) and checking if they can be used to split \( x \) into \( n \) parts.
3. The logic in `func_1` is as follows:
   - It iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of \( x \).
   - For each divisor \( i \) of \( x \), it checks if \( i \) or \( x // i \) can be used to split \( x \) into \( n \) parts.
   - It updates the answer (`ans`) with the maximum value between \( i \) and \( x // i \).
4. The key observation is that the GCD of \( n \) identical numbers is the number itself. Therefore, the maximum balance is indeed the maximum of \( n \) and \( x // n \).
5. The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the function, which matches the intended solution.

Given these points, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
