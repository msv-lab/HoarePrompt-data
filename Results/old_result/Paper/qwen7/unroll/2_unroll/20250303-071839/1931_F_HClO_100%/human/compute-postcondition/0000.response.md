Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of an integer input, and the values of `n` and `k` are yet to be defined, and each screenshot description is a list of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`, representing the order of participants as seen by the respective user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n` and `k` remain undefined, and the precondition regarding the screenshot descriptions remains unchanged.
