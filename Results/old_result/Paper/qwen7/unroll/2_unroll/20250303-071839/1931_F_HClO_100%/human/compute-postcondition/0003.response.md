Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three variables t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and n ⋅ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function returns a list of n distinct integers ranging from 1 to n, representing the order of participants as seen by the respective user.**
