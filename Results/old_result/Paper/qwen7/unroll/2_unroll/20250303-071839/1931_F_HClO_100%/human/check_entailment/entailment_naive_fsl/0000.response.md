Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to properly handle scenarios where the order of elements in the screenshots does not align with the expected order after considering the position of the author of the screenshot. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4 4
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3 2 1 4
4 2 3 1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program incorrectly assumes that if the author's position is not at the top, the rest of the list must match exactly. In this case, the second screenshot shows `2` at the top, but the third and fourth screenshots do not maintain the same relative order of the remaining elements, leading the program to incorrectly conclude that the orders do not match.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the relative order of the elements in the screenshots, excluding the author, must remain consistent across all screenshots. The current implementation does not fully account for this requirement.
