Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially empty lists.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` where the default factory is `list`. This means that when a key is accessed that does not exist in the dictionary, it will automatically create an empty list for that key. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
