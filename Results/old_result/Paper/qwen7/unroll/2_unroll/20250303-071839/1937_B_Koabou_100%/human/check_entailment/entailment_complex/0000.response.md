Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not find the lexicographically smallest string and count the number of paths that produce this string.
2. The current implementation of `func_1()` only checks for a specific pattern (a substring of `a[0]` matching a suffix of `a[1]`) and prints this substring along with a hardcoded value of `1` for `t`.
3. The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by any path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid, considering the allowed moves (downwards or right).
4. The provided function does not consider all possible paths and does not ensure that the lexicographically smallest string is found.
5. The function also does not calculate the number of paths that produce this lexicographically smallest string.

Given these points, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
