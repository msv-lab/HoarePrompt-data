Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings a_{1} and a_{2} of length n, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. It returns a result based on the comparison of these two binary strings for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t, another integer n, and two binary strings of length n. The function compares these strings and returns a result for each test case based on their comparison.
