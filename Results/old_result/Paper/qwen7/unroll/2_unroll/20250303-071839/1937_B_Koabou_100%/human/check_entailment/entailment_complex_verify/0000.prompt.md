You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list containing two elements, each element is an input value from the user; `n` is an input integer.
    #
    #This means after the loop executes, the list `a` will contain two input values provided by the user, while `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes, the variables `s` and `x` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop. The variable `y` will be assigned the value of `i` if the first condition is met, and `x` will be assigned the value of `i` if the second condition is met and the `break` statement is executed. If neither condition is met for any `i` in the range, `s` will be set to the concatenation of `a[0]` and `a[1][n-1]`, and `x` will be set to `n-1`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is a list containing two elements, each element is a string, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `y` to `x`. For each iteration, it checks if a substring of `a[1]` starting at index `i` and ending at index `x-1` is equal to a corresponding substring of `s` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `x`. If a match is found, it sets `t` to the length of the matching substring (`x - i + 1`) and breaks out of the loop. Since the problem does not provide specific values for `x`, `y`, `a`, and `s`, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`. However, based on the given code, `t` will be set to some positive integer (or 1 if a match is found) or remain 1 if no match is found within the loop. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]` of length `n`. It finds a substring `s` in the first string `a[0]` that matches a suffix of the second string `a[1]`, and calculates the length of this matching substring. The function then prints the substring `s` and the calculated length `t`, which is always 1 if no match is found.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the lexicographically smallest path involves multiple segments of the same character. Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the following input:
```
3
2
01
10
4
1111
1111
8
00100111
11101101
```

The expected output for the first test case is:
```
000
2
```

However, the program will produce:
```
010
1
```

This happens because the program logic is flawed. It tries to find a point where the path can switch from the top row to the bottom row, but it does not correctly handle the case where the lexicographically smallest path involves multiple segments of the same character. For instance, in the second test case, the lexicographically smallest path is `11000`, but the program incorrectly outputs `1111` with a count of `1`.

A correct solution would involve dynamic programming to keep track of the lexicographically smallest path and the number of such paths.
