Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the lexicographically smallest path involves multiple segments of the same character. Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the following input:
```
3
2
01
10
4
1111
1111
8
00100111
11101101
```

The expected output for the first test case is:
```
000
2
```

However, the program will produce:
```
010
1
```

This happens because the program logic is flawed. It tries to find a point where the path can switch from the top row to the bottom row, but it does not correctly handle the case where the lexicographically smallest path involves multiple segments of the same character. For instance, in the second test case, the lexicographically smallest path is `11000`, but the program incorrectly outputs `1111` with a count of `1`.

A correct solution would involve dynamic programming to keep track of the lexicographically smallest path and the number of such paths.
