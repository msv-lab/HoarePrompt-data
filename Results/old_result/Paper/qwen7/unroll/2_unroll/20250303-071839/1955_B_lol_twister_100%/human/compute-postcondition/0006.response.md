Output State: **`a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of integers where each element `l[i]` (for i in 0 to n^2-1) is given by `a + floor(i/n) * c + i % n * d`; `li` is a list of length n^2 containing the same elements as `l` sorted in ascending order, `l` is now sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `a`, `n`, `c`, `d`, and `li` remain unchanged. After sorting, `l` contains its elements in ascending order, starting from the minimum value `a` up to the maximum value determined by the formula `a + floor(i/n) * c + i % n * d` for `i` ranging from 0 to \(n^2-1\).
