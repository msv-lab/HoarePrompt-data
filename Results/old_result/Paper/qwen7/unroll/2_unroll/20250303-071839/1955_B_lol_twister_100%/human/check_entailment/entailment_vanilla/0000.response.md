Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads a list of `n^2` integers into the list `l`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` as arguments.
   - It calculates the minimum value in `l` and stores it in `a`.
   - It then constructs a list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for all possible pairs `(k, h)` within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - The list `li` is sorted.
   - The original list `l` is also sorted.
   - If the sorted lists `li` and `l` are equal, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly generates the progressive square based on the given formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - It then checks if the generated sequence matches the sorted input list `l`.
   - The sorting step ensures that the order of elements is considered, which is necessary since the problem specifies that the elements must match exactly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - The constraints are respected (e.g., `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `2 <= n <= 500`, etc.).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list of integers can form a progressive square based on the specified rules. There are no logical errors or omissions that would cause the program to fail under the given constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
