Output State: `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of integers where each element `l[i]` (for i in 0 to n^2-1) is given by `a + floor(i/n) * c + i % n * d`; `li` is a list of length n^2 containing the same elements as `l`.
