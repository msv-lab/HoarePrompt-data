The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of integers where each element `l_i` satisfies 1 <= l_i <= 10^9 and the length of `l` is n^2.

The function returns either 'yes' or 'no'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, two integers `c` and `d`, and a list `l` of integers, and based on some unspecified conditions, it returns 'yes' or 'no'.
