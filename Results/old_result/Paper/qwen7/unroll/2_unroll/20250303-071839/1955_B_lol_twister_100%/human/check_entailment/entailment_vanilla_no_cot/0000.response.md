Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function aims to generate the expected progressive square values based on the given `a_{1,1}`, `c`, and `d`. However, the calculation inside the nested loops is incorrect. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the value at position `(k, h)` should be `a + k * c + h * d`, not `a + k * c + d * h`.

Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(n):
        for h in range(n):
            li.append(a + k * c + h * d)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

With this correction, the function correctly generates the expected progressive square values and compares them with the given list of numbers.
