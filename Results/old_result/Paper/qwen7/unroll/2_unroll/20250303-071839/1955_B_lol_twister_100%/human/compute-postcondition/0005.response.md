Output State: **`a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of integers where each element `l[i]` (for i in 0 to n^2-1) is given by `a + floor(i/n) * c + i % n * d`; `li` is a list of length n^2 containing the same elements as `l` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `li.sort()` sorts the list `li` in ascending order. Since `li` contains the same elements as `l`, sorting `li` rearranges its elements while keeping the relationship between `a`, `n`, `c`, `d`, and the elements of `l` unchanged. Therefore, the minimum value in `l` remains `a`, and the values of `n`, `c`, and `d` stay the same. The only change is that `li` now contains the elements of `l` sorted in ascending order.
