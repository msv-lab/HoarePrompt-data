### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Reading Input
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`.
- It then reads a list of `n^2` integers into the list `l`.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` as arguments.
- It calculates the minimum value in `l` and stores it in `a`.
- It then constructs a list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for all possible pairs `(k, h)` within the range `[0, n-1]`.
- The list `li` is sorted.
- The original list `l` is also sorted.
- If the sorted lists `li` and `l` are equal, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

#### Checking the Logic
- The logic in `func_1` correctly generates the progressive square based on the given formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
- It then checks if the generated sequence matches the sorted input list `l`.
- The sorting step ensures that the order of elements is considered, which is necessary since the problem specifies that the elements must match exactly.

#### Edge Cases
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
- The constraints are respected (e.g., `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `2 <= n <= 500`, etc.).

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic in the function `func_1`. Specifically, the function assumes that the minimum value in the list `l` is `a`. This assumption might not always hold true because the minimum value in `l` could be different from the starting value `a` of the progressive square.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:
- Suppose `n = 3`, `c = 2`, `d = 3`, and the list `l` is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]`.
- The minimum value in `l` is `1`, but the starting value `a` of the progressive square should be `1` (since the progressive square starts with `a`).

In this case, the function works correctly. However, if the minimum value in `l` is not `a`, the function will incorrectly identify the list as not matching the progressive square.

For instance, consider the following example:
- Suppose `n = 3`, `c = 2`, `d = 3`, and the list `l` is `[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 1]`.
- The minimum value in `l` is `1`, but the starting value `a` of the progressive square should be `1`.
- The function will generate the list `li` starting from `1` and will not match the list `l` because the elements are out of order.

Therefore, the function is not correctly handling cases where the minimum value in `l` is not the starting value `a` of the progressive square.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program has a logical flaw in the way it identifies the starting value `a` of the progressive square. The function assumes that the minimum value in `l` is `a`, which may not always be true.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
