Output State: `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of integers where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for every combination of `k` and `h` in the range of 0 to `n-1`. `li` is a list containing all these elements, and its length is `n^2`.
