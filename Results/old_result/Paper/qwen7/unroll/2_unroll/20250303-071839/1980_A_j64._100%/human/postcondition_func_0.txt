The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; `m` is an integer between 1 and 5; and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates and returns the value of `needed_problems`, which is determined as 7 times `m` minus the total count of all characters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) in the string `a`.
