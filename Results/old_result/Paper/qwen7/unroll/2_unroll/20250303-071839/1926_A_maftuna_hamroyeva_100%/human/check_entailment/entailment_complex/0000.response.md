Reasoning:
1. The function correctly initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively.
2. It iterates through each character in the input string and updates the counters accordingly.
3. After counting the occurrences, it compares the counts and prints the appropriate character ('A' or 'B') based on which has a higher count.
4. The function handles multiple test cases as specified by the input integer `t`.
5. The provided example test cases match the expected behavior of the function.

Given the analysis, the function appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
