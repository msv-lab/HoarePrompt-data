### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
   - It uses two counters `l` and `h` to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the counts and prints the character ('A' or 'B') that appears more frequently.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there is a tie between 'A' and 'B' (i.e., both counters have the same value), the program will still print one of the characters based on the comparison. However, the problem statement specifies that all strings are distinct, so ties should not occur.
5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the required character for each test case in the specified format.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program seems to handle all cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is sound and should work as expected for the given problem.

**Correctness: **True**
