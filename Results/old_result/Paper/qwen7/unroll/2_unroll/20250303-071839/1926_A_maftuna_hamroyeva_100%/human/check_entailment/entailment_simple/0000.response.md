Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading a string of length 5.
3. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. It then prints 'A' if there are more 'A's than 'B's, and 'B' otherwise.
5. Given the constraints and the problem statement, this logic should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Since the program follows the correct logic and the provided example outputs match the expected results, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
