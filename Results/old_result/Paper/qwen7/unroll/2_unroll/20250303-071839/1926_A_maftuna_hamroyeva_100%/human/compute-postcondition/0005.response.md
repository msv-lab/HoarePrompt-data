Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. Based on whether the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints either 'A' or 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.**
