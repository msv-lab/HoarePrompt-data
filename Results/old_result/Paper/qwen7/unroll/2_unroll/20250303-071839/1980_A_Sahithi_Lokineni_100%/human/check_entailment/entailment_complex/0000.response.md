Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
3. It initializes a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
4. It iterates through the string `s` and updates the counts in the dictionary `d`.
5. It calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed by checking how many of each difficulty level are missing to ensure there are at least `m` problems for each difficulty level.
6. The logic for calculating the number of additional problems is correct. If the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, the difference `m - d[val]` is added to `ans`.

Given the provided example and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
