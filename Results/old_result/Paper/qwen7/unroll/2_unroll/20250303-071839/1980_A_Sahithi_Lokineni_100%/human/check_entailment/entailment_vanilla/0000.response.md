### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to ensure that Vlad can conduct `m` rounds with at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - If there are not enough problems of a certain difficulty level, we need to calculate how many additional problems are required.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of rounds).

3. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - This part is correct and ensures that we have the correct counts of each difficulty level.

4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes the counts for each difficulty level to 0.
   - It iterates through the input string and updates the counts.
   - For each difficulty level, it calculates the number of additional problems needed using the formula `m - d[val]` if `d[val]` is less than `m`.
   - The total number of additional problems needed is stored in `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the number of problems in the bank is sufficient for all rounds without needing any additional problems.
   - It also handles cases where some difficulty levels are missing and calculates the exact number of additional problems needed.

7. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is unused and does not affect the main logic of the program.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
