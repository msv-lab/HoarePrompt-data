Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the variable `ans` is the sum of the maximum values of zero or one less than each count in the list `cnt`, where `cnt` is an array of size `n+1` initialized to zero. Each element in `cnt` corresponds to the count of each integer from 1 to `n` in the list `a`. After executing all iterations of the loop, `ans` represents the total number of pairs of identical integers that can be formed from the given lists `a`.
