Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene. Here's how the logic works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and the list of integers \( a \). It then counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to \( n \) using the `cnt` array.
3. **Calculating Points**: For each count \( x \) in the `cnt` array, it adds the maximum value of 0 and \( x-1 \) to the `ans` variable. This calculation is based on the fact that if a number \( x \) appears \( x \) times in your hand, you can ensure to get \( x-1 \) points by playing optimally (since Nene will block one occurrence of \( x \) to minimize your score).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

Therefore, the provided program matches the requirements and logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
