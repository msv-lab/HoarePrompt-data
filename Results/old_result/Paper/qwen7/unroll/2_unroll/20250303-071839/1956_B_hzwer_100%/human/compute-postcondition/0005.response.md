Functionality: **The function processes a series of inputs, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of integers \( a \), where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears at most twice. For each input, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list \( a \) and calculates the sum of the maximum values of 0 and \( x-1 \) for each count \( x \). Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each input.**
