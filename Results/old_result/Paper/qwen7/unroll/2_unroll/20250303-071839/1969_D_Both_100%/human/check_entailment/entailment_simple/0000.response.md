### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correctly defined and handle the input as expected.
   - `func_1` reads an integer from the input, which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` reads a line of space-separated integers and returns a map object, which is later converted to a list.
   - `func_3` calculates the maximum possible profit from a given list of items, considering the constraints and the logic provided in the problem statement.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4`**:
   - The function correctly initializes variables and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of items `n` and the threshold `k` for each test case.
   - It reads the prices `a_i` and bonuses `b_i` for each item.
   - It constructs a list of tuples `combined` with negative prices and bonuses.
   - It sorts the `combined` list to prioritize items with higher bonuses.
   - It uses a min-heap (`heap`) to keep track of the items taken for free by Bob.
   - It iterates through the sorted list and calculates the profit, ensuring that the maximum profit is tracked.
   - It handles the case where the number of items bought by Alice is less than `k` and calculates the profit accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.
   - It correctly processes the input and outputs the maximum profit for each test case.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum profit for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Conclusion:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the necessary cases and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
