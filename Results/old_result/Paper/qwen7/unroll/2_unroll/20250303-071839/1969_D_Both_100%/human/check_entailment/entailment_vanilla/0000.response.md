Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Returns an integer value representing the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()`: Returns a tuple of integers from a line of input.
   - `func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap)`: Computes the total profit based on the items in `primary_items` and the state of `secondary_heap`.
   - `func_4()`: The main function that processes each test case.

2. **Main Function (`func_4()`)**:
   - **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases, then iterates over each test case.
   - **Heap Initialization**: Initializes a min-heap (`heap`) and a list (`remaining_items`).
   - **Reading Prices and Bonuses**: Reads the prices and bonuses for each item.
   - **Sorting and Initial Heap Population**: Sorts the items based on their bonuses and pushes the top `k` items into the heap.
   - **Profit Calculation**:
     - If there are more items than `k`, it calculates the profit using `func_3`.
     - It then iteratively processes the remaining items, updating the profit by considering whether to include or exclude items based on their net values (price - bonus).

3. **Profit Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_3` sums up the bonuses of items in the `secondary_heap` and adds the adjusted values of items in `primary_items`.
   - The main loop in `func_4` ensures that only profitable items (where price - bonus â‰¥ 0) are considered, and it updates the heap accordingly.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
- **Item Selection and Profit Calculation**: The logic for selecting items and calculating profit aligns with the problem description.
- **Optimal Strategy**: The program considers the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice maximizes her profit and Bob minimizes it.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
