Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n; prices is a list of n integers where each integer represents the price a_i for Alice; bonuses is a list of n integers where each integer represents the price b_i for Bob; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
