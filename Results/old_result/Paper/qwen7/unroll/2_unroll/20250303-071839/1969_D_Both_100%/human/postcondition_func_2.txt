The function accepts a list of tuples `primary_items`, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i), and a list of integers `secondary_heap` representing the difference (b_i - a_i) for each item. It calculates and returns the sum of the first element plus the second element of each tuple in `primary_items` if the sum of the elements in the tuple is greater than or equal to 0.
