Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, where for each input string `s`:

1. If `s` has a length of 1, it will print "No".
2. If `s` consists of the same character repeated (e.g., "aaa"), it will also print "No".
3. Otherwise, it will print "Yes" followed by a permutation of the characters in `s`.

Since the exact inputs are not specified, we cannot provide a specific output state, but the general form of the output state can be described as above.
