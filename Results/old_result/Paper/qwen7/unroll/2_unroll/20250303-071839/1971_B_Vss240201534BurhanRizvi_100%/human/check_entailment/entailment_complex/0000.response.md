Reasoning:

1. **Edge Cases Handling**: 
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string `s` has a length of 1 by printing "No".
   - It also correctly handles the case where the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (e.g., "aaaaa") by printing "No".

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the characters in `s`. This part is correct as long as `s` is not composed of the same character repeated (which would result in `s` being equal to `s2` after shuffling).

3. **Handling Equal Strings After Shuffling**:
   - If the shuffled string `s2` is equal to the original string `s`, the program correctly handles this by appending the first character to the end of the remaining characters (`s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" followed by a permutation of the characters in `s` if a valid permutation is found. This meets the requirement of the problem statement.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
