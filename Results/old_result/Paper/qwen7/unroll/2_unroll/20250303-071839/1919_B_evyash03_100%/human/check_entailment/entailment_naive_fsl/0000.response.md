Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' in the string and returns its absolute value. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
length = 6
expression = "--++--"
```
The program would calculate `count = 2` (number of '+') and `sub = 4` (number of '-'), and return `abs(2 - 4) = 2`. However, the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is `([--++], [--])`, which results in a penalty of `2 * 4 + 2 * 2 = 12`.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm to find the optimal splits. The current implementation does not handle all cases correctly and fails to find the minimum possible penalty.
