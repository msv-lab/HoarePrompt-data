Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem statement:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

2. **Given Program**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length`.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in `expression` and stores it in `count`.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of `expression` and `count`.
   - It returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The function does not actually split the array into subarrays to calculate the penalties.
   - It simply computes a difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not reflect the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.
   - The logic does not consider the actual sums of subarrays or their lengths, which are crucial for calculating the penalties.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `-----` (length 5), the function would count 0 '+' characters, so `count = 0` and `sub = 5`. The result is `abs(5 - 0) = 5`, which is incorrect because the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` with a total penalty of 5, but this is not achieved by the current logic.
   - For the input `+-+-+` (length 6), the function would count 3 '+' characters, so `count = 3` and `sub = 3`. The result is `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is incorrect because the optimal split could be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])` with a total penalty of 0.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
