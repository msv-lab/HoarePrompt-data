#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is the number of '+' characters in the `expression`.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`, where `sub` is the difference between the length of `expression` and the number of '+' characters in `expression`, and `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and an integer `length` indicating the length of `expression`. It calculates the number of "+" characters in `expression` and computes the absolute difference between the length of `expression` and this count. The function then returns this absolute difference.
