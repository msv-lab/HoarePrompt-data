You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(func_1(expression, length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and an integer `length` indicating the length of `expression`. It calculates the number of "+" characters in `expression` and computes the absolute difference between the length of `expression` and this count. The function then returns this absolute difference.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`length`) and the string itself (`expression`).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(expression, length)` to compute the minimum penalty.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length`.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in the string, which corresponds to the number of 1's in the array `a`.
   - `sub` is calculated as the difference between the length of the string and the count of '+' characters, which corresponds to the number of -1's in the array `a`.
   - The function returns the absolute difference between `count` and `sub`, which is `abs(length - 2 * count)`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of 1's and -1's, which does not necessarily give the minimum penalty.
   - To minimize the penalty, we need to consider how to split the array optimally. The optimal strategy is to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero whenever possible, which would result in a penalty of 0 for those segments.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example test case `+-+-+`, the function incorrectly returns 4, but the correct minimum penalty should be 0 by splitting into `([1], [-1], [1], [-1], [1])`.

Given the analysis, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem.
