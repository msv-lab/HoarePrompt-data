### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to split the array \(a\) (represented by the string `expression`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program should output the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `expression` and the string itself.
   - It calls the function `func_1(expression, length)` to compute the result.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression` and stores it in `count`.
   - It then calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of `expression` and `count`.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`.

4. **Annotated Code Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of '+' characters in the string.
   - It then computes `sub` as the difference between the length of the string and the number of '+' characters.
   - The return value is the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`.

5. **Original Assessment Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty.
   - The assessment provides an example to demonstrate why the current approach is incorrect.
   - The example given is `length = 6` and `expression = "--++--"`.
   - The program calculates `count = 2` and `sub = 4`, and returns `abs(2 - 4) = 2`.
   - However, the optimal way to split the array is `([--++], [--])`, resulting in a penalty of `2 * 4 + 2 * 2 = 12`.

6. **Re-evaluation with Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm to find the optimal splits.
   - The current implementation does not handle all cases correctly and fails to find the minimum possible penalty.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program indeed does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as it only considers the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters without considering the optimal splits.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
