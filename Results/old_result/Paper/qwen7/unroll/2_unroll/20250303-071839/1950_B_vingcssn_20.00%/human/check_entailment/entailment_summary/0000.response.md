Reasoning:
The provided program only handles the cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). However, the problem description states that \( n \) can be up to 20. The program does not provide a general solution for \( n > 4 \), which means it will always print "No esta en el rango" for any \( n \) greater than 4. This is incorrect because the problem requires generating a checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) within the specified range (1 to 20).

Given this, the program cannot correctly generate the required 2n Ã— 2n checkerboard for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
