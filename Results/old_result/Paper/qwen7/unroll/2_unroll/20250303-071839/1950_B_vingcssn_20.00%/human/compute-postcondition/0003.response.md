Output State: The output will consist of multiple patterns printed based on the value of `n` for each iteration of the loop. If `n` is 1, it will print two lines with `##`. If `n` is 2, it will print four lines with `##..` followed by four lines with `..##`. If `n` is 3, it will print six lines with various combinations of `##` and `..`. If `n` is 4, it will print eight lines with specific patterns. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it will print 'No esta en el rango' (which means 'Not in the range') for that iteration. The number of times each pattern is printed corresponds to the value of `casos`.
