Output State: The number of elements in the list `nums` after processing each test case, followed by the elements themselves. The list `nums` will contain up to 24 unique elements, which are derived from the initial powers of 2 (up to \(2^{20}\)), with additional elements added based on the value of `k`. Specifically, for each test case, the list `nums` will include the following elements: the initial powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\), the value of `k`, `k-1`, `k+1`, and `k+2^{idx}+1`, where `idx` is the index just before the first power of 2 greater than `k`. The exact contents of `nums` will vary depending on the value of `k` relative to the initial powers of 2.
