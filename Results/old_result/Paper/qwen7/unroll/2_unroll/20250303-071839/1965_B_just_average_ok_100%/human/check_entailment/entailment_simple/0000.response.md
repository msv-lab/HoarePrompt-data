Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - All integers from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The code initializes a list `nums` with 21 elements, which are powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152]`.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and calculates an additional element `k - nums[idx]`.
   - It appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.
   - Finally, it removes the largest power of 2 used in the calculation.
   - This approach ensures that:
     - No subsequence sums to \(k\) because \(k\) is specifically excluded.
     - All integers from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) can be represented as a subsequence sum due to the properties of binary representation and the inclusion of `k - nums[idx]`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The constructed sequence `nums` will always have a length of 23 or less, meeting the constraint of having at most 25 elements.
   - The elements are unique and cover all required sums from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)).
   - The solution handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Conclusion:
The given solution correctly addresses the problem requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
