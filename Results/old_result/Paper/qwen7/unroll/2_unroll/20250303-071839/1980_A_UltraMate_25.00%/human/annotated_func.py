#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5. The string a consists of n characters, each character is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n and m are integers, s is a string consisting of characters from 'A' to 'F', ans is the calculated sum based on the conditions given, and p is the string 'ABCDEF'. After all iterations, ans is the cumulative sum of all individual ans values from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'F'. It calculates a value `ans` based on the counts of characters in `s` and the integer `m`. Specifically, `ans` is incremented by `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `s`, and for each character present in `s`, `ans` is incremented by the difference between `m` and the count of that character in `s`. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum of all `ans` values after processing all test cases.
