### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example inputs.

#### Problem Description:
- Vlad needs to ensure that each of the \( m \) rounds has at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
- He can use existing problems and create new ones if needed.
- The goal is to minimize the number of new problems created.

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of existing problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and a string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
- It calculates the minimum number of new problems needed by checking the counts of each difficulty level in the string `s` and comparing them with `m`.

#### Provided Program:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - The initial assessment claims the program is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap between rounds and incorrectly increments the count for each missing difficulty level.

2. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
   - For each difficulty level in 'ABCDEF':
     - If the difficulty level is not present in `s`, it assumes Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty.
     - If the difficulty level is present but the count is less than `m`, it calculates the additional problems needed to meet the requirement for `m` rounds.
   - This approach ensures that for each difficulty level, the total number of problems available is at least `m`.

3. **Example Inputs:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `7 2 ABCDEFABC`
     - Existing problems: `ABCDEFABC`
     - Required problems per round: `2`
     - Calculation:
       - 'A': 1 (needs 1 more)
       - 'B': 1 (needs 1 more)
       - 'C': 1 (needs 1 more)
       - 'D': 1 (needs 1 more)
       - 'E': 1 (needs 1 more)
       - 'F': 1 (needs 1 more)
     - Total new problems: `6`
     - Correct answer: `2` (since 'G' is missing, and we only need one 'G' and one other difficulty to make up for the shortfall).

   - **Test Case 2:** `4 2 ABCDABCD`
     - Existing problems: `ABCDABCD`
     - Required problems per round: `2`
     - Calculation:
       - 'A': 2 (no additional needed)
       - 'B': 2 (no additional needed)
       - 'C': 2 (no additional needed)
       - 'D': 2 (no additional needed)
       - 'E': 0 (no additional needed)
       - 'F': 0 (no additional needed)
     - Total new problems: `0`
     - Correct answer: `0` (all difficulties are already present).

   - **Test Case 3:** `5 1 ABCDEABCDE`
     - Existing problems: `ABCDEABCDE`
     - Required problems per round: `1`
     - Calculation:
       - 'A': 2 (no additional needed)
       - 'B': 2 (no additional needed)
       - 'C': 2 (no additional needed)
       - 'D': 2 (no additional needed)
       - 'E': 2 (no additional needed)
       - 'F': 0 (no additional needed)
     - Total new problems: `0`
     - Correct answer: `0` (all difficulties are already present).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure each round has one problem of each difficulty level. The program accounts for the overlap between rounds and correctly handles the cases where some difficulties are missing.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
