Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is an underscore, often used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Input and Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. This means the loop will continue until the input is no longer a positive integer.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means there are `t` test cases to process.

4. **Loop Execution**: For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers with specific constraints, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

5. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop continues based on the input from `int(input())`, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t`. The loop will run exactly `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
