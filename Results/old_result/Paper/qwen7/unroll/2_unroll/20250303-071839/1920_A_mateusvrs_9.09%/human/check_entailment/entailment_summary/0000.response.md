Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement and execution summary. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to keep track of the maximum value from type 1 constraints and the minimum value from type 2 constraints, respectively.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store the values of type 3 constraints (values that `k` must not be equal to).

3. **Constraint Logic**:
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax`, `bx`, or adds the value to `cx` based on the type of constraint.
   - If `bx` (maximum value from type 1 constraints) is greater than or equal to `ax` (minimum value from type 2 constraints), it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, so it appends `0` to the result list.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of overlapping values in `cx` from the total range (`ax - bx + 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for all test cases, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
