Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes necessary variables to keep track of the maximum lower bound (`bx`), minimum upper bound (`ax`), and a set of excluded values (`cx`).

2. **Reading Constraints**: For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then iterates through each constraint, updating `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` based on the type of constraint:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (greater than or equal to `x`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (less than or equal to `x`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (not equal to `x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Validation and Calculation**: After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of excluded values within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in this range (`ax - bx + 1`).

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
