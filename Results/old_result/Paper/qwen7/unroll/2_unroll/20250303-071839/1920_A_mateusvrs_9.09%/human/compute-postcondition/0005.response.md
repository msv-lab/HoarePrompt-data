Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `r` is a list containing integers where each integer is the result of the logic inside the loop based on the values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` for each iteration.

However, the specific logic inside the loop to determine the values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` and subsequently the values of `r` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the list `r`.

Given this, the output will be the elements of the list `r` printed on separate lines.

Output: **[elements of r printed on separate lines]**
