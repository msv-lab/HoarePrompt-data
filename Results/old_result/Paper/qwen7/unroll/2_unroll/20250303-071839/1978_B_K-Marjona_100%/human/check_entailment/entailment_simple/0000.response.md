Reasoning:
1. The problem statement describes a scenario where Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b - a) \)) to sell the first \( k \) buns at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
2. The goal is to maximize the profit.
3. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement:
   - It iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as \( \min(n, b - a) \).
   - If \( b \le a \), it sells all buns at the usual price \( a \), so the profit is \( a \times n \).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
