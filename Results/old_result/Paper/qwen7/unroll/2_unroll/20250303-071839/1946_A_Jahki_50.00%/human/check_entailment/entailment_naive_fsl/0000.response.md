Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the median is already the maximum value in the array. Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
3
2
1 2
```

The correct output should be `0` because the median is already `1.5` (since the array is `[1, 2]` and the median is the average of the two middle elements), and no operations are needed to increase the median. However, the program will output `1` because it always increments the element at the median position until it exceeds the current median, which is unnecessary in this case.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the current median is already the maximum value in the array and handle such cases appropriately.
