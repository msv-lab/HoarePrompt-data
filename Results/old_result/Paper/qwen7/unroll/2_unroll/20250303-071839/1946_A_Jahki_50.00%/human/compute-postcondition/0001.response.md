State: **`num` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(0, num)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `num`.
2. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. For the loop to start executing, `i` must be less than `num`.
4. The initial value of `i` is 0, so the condition `i < num` will be true if and only if `num` is greater than 0.
5. The variable `num` represents the number of test cases, and it must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `num` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
