Output State: The output state will consist of a series of pairs of integers. For each test case, there will be two lines of output. The first line will contain an integer `op`, which represents the number of operations needed to make the median of the array equal to the maximum possible value under the given constraints. The second line will contain the integer `16668`. This occurs if `num2` (the length of the array `a` for each test case) is greater than 10000; otherwise, it will contain the count of operations required to adjust the median as described in the loop body.
