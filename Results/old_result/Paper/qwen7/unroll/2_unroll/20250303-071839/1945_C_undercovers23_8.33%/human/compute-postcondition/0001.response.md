Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop `for _ in range(t)` to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is a positive integer, this condition is inherently satisfied by the given constraints.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and is a valid input for the loop to execute. Given that `t` is a positive integer, the only adjustment needed is to confirm that `t` is a valid positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
