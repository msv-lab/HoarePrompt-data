Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using percentages instead of counts. This leads to incorrect results because the conditions for satisfaction (`zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`) do not accurately reflect the requirement that at least half of the residents on each side should be satisfied.

For example, consider the input:

```
6
010111
```

The program should find the optimal position to place the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. However, due to the percentage calculation, the program might incorrectly determine that placing the road after the third house (index 2) is valid, which is not correct according to the problem statement.

The correct approach should involve counting the number of zeros and ones on each side and checking if they meet the required conditions. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        
        zero, one = 0, 0
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and (o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs((n // 2) - ele))
        
        final = [ele for ele in lst if abs((n // 2) - ele) == mini]
        final.sort()
        
        if len(final) == 0:
            if o * 100 // n >= 50:
                final.append(0)
            else:
                final.append(n)
        
        print(final[0])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions for satisfaction are checked correctly using counts instead of percentages.
