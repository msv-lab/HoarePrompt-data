Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the number of initial arrays \(a\) (consisting of 1s and -1s) that can produce a given sorted prefix sum array \(p\). The solution involves dynamic programming to count the possible configurations of \(a\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the number of ways to construct the array \(a\) that results in the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).
   - It uses dynamic programming to build up the possible configurations.
   - The state `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `j - offset`.
   - The function iterates through the prefix sums and updates the DP table accordingly.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads input from standard input, parses the test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored and printed at the end.

4. **Input Parsing**:
   - The input is read using `sys.stdin.read` and split into tokens.
   - The number of test cases, \(t\), is read first.
   - For each test case, the size of the array \(n\) and the sorted prefix sum array \(p\) are read and processed.

5. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the transitions between possible prefix sums.
   - The final result is computed by finding the correct position in the DP table corresponding to the last element of the sorted prefix sum array.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The operations are performed modulo \(998244353\), ensuring that the result fits within the required constraints.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases such as when the prefix sum array \(p\) is empty or has specific values that make it impossible to construct the original array \(a\).

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
