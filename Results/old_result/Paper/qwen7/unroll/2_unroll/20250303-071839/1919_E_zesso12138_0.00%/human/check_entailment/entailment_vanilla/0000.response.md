Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that the sorted prefix sums match the given `p`.
   - The function `func_1` should compute the number of such arrays.
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to compute the number of ways to construct the array `a` such that the sorted prefix sums match `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming with a DP table `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j - n` (offset by `n`).

3. **DP Table Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, meaning one way to have a prefix sum of `0` (since `offset = n`).

4. **DP Transition**:
   - For each position `i` from `1` to `n`, it updates the DP table `new_dp` by considering the previous state `dp[j]` and adding `1` or `-1` to the prefix sum.
   - This transition ensures that we explore all possible prefix sums up to `2 * n`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all positions, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The value at `dp[final_sum]` gives the number of ways to achieve the desired prefix sums.

6. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Verification

1. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The logic of updating the DP table correctly explores all possible prefix sums.
   - The final result is computed correctly by checking the value at the final prefix sum position.

2. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function reads input correctly and processes each test case independently.
   - It calls `func_1` with the correct parameters and prints the results.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The dynamic programming approach and the input handling are appropriate and logically sound.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
