Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that both `func_1` and `func_2` work together to solve the problem as described. Specifically, `func_2` should correctly read the input and call `func_1` for each test case, while `func_1` should correctly compute the number of possible arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

Let's analyze each function:

1. **`func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of ways to construct an array `a` from the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to keep track of possible prefix sums.
   - The function initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j - n`.
   - It iterates through the elements of `p` and updates the DP array accordingly.
   - The final result is derived from `dp[p[-1] + n]`.

2. **`func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, and the sorted prefix sum array `p` for each test case.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, both functions appear to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` seems appropriate for calculating the number of valid arrays `a`, and `func_2` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
