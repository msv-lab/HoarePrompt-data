You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: index is 2 + 2 * t, t is the number of iterations, n is the sum of the integers obtained from data[index:index + n] for each iteration, p is a list of integers obtained from data[index:index + n] for each iteration, results is a list containing the results of calling func_1(n, p) for each iteration.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: index is 2 + 2 * t, t is the number of iterations, n is the sum of the integers obtained from data[index:index + n] for each iteration, p is a list of integers obtained from data[index:index + n] for each iteration, results is a list containing the results of calling func_1(n, p) for each iteration, no change in the loop, only printing the results.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`; and `p`, a list of `n` integers where |p_i| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not return anything as the output description does not specify a return value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
