Output State: **index is 2 + 2 * t, t is the number of iterations, n is the sum of the integers obtained from data[index:index + n] for each iteration, p is a list of integers obtained from data[index:index + n] for each iteration, results is a list containing the results of calling func_1(n, p) for each iteration, no change in the loop, only printing the results.**

Explanation: The given loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. Since the loop does not modify any of the variables (`index`, `n`, `p`, or `results`), their states remain the same as the initial state. The only change is that the results will be printed during each iteration.
