Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code attempts to find a way to maximize the score by redistributing the cards, but it does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically:

1. **Sorting and Initial Setup**: The code sorts the array `a` and tries to find a point where the remaining budget `k` cannot be fully spent on increasing the count of any card type. This approach is overly simplistic and does not guarantee the maximum score.

2. **Calculation of Remaining Budget**: The calculation of `rem` and `y` is not correctly aligned with the problem requirements. The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation of the score using `(r - 1) * n + 1` or `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` does not accurately reflect the number of valid subarrays.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, possibly involving dynamic programming or a more nuanced redistribution strategy that considers all possible ways to spend the budget `k` to maximize the score. The current implementation does not achieve this.
