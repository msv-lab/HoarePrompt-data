You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines of text, each line being either 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically smallest string or its reverse, or 'NO'. The number of these lines will be equal to the value of `n`. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the program reads a string `s` from input. If the string `s` contains all unique characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or its reverse, whichever comes first when sorted normally.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - For each string `s`, it creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, so it prints 'NO'. This part is correct because if all characters are the same, no rearrangement can produce a different string.

3. **Generating Rearranged Strings:**
   - If the set `a` has more than one unique character, it proceeds to generate two possible rearranged strings:
     - `b`: A sorted version of `s` (in ascending order).
     - `c`: A sorted version of `s` (in descending order).
   - It checks if `b` is equal to `s`. If `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `b` (which is a valid rearrangement since it is not equal to `s`).
   - If `b` is equal to `s`, it prints `c` (which is also a valid rearrangement since it is not equal to `s`).

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where all characters are the same by printing 'NO'.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the string has exactly two distinct characters but still has a length greater than 2. In such cases, both `b` and `c` would be the same, and the program would incorrectly print `c` instead of generating a different valid rearrangement.

2. **Generating Different Valid Rearrangements:**
   - The program only generates two specific types of rearrangements (`b` and `c`). It does not explore other possible valid rearrangements that might exist. For example, if the string is "abab", the program would only generate "abab" and "baba", but there could be other valid rearrangements like "aabb".

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:

Consider the string "abab":
- The program sorts it to get "abab" and "baba".
- Since "abab" is the same as the original string, it prints "baba".
- However, "aabb" is also a valid rearrangement that is different from "abab".

### Conclusion:

The program does not guarantee to find any valid rearrangement if multiple valid rearrangements exist. Therefore, it is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
