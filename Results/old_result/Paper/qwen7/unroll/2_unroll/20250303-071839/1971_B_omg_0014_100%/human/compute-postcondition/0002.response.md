Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines of text, each line either 'NO', 'YES' followed by a string, or another 'YES' followed by a different string. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `n`. For each iteration of the loop, if the input string `s` contains all unique characters, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES' followed by the lexicographically sorted version of `s` and then either the reverse sorted version of `s` or the lexicographically sorted version again, depending on which one is different from the original string `s`.
