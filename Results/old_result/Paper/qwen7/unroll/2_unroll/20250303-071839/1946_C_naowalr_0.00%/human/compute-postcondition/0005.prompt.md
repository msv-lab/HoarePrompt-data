You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The adjacency list adj represents a tree where adj[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex i. The variable L is initialized to 1 and R is initialized to 100001. The function dfs is assumed to exist and returns the number of vertices in the largest connected component that remains after removing the edges according to the current value of x.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `L` is 1, `R` is 1.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that the number of cuts required to divide the tree into components where no component has more than `x` nodes is less than or equal to `k`. After each iteration, the value of `L` is updated based on the result of the binary search. Since the binary search converges to a specific value within the range `[L, R]`, and `R` is initially set to `int(100000.0 + 1)` which is 100001, the final value of `L` will be the largest value that satisfies the condition. However, since the loop ends when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, the final value of `L` will be 1, and `R` will also be 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses pre-initialized variables t, n, k, adj, L, and R. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the largest connected component in a tree structure represented by the adjacency list adj after removing certain edges, and returns the size of this component.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
