The function reads multiple sets of inputs, each consisting of the number of vertices \( n \), the number of cuts \( k \), and an adjacency list representing a tree. It then performs a binary search to find the maximum value \( x \) such that the number of cuts required to divide the tree into components where no component has more than \( x \) nodes is less than or equal to \( k \). The function outputs the value of \( L \) after the binary search completes, which represents the largest possible value \( x \) satisfying the condition.
