Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `idx`: 0
   - `idx_v`: 1
   - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5
   - `k`: An integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ n and k is even
   - `permutation`: A list of length n where elements at positions 0, k, 2k, ..., k*(k-1) are filled with values from 1 to k.
   - `curr_v`: k + 1
   - `result`: A string containing space-separated values from the `permutation` list converted to strings.

2. **Understanding the `permutation` list:**
   - The list `permutation` has a length of `n`.
   - Elements at positions 0, k, 2k, ..., k*(k-1) are filled with values from 1 to k.
   - Since `k` is even and within the range 2 ≤ k ≤ n, the positions mentioned above will contain the numbers 1 through k exactly once.

3. **Value of `result`:**
   - `result` is constructed by converting the elements of the `permutation` list to strings and then joining them with spaces.
   - Given that the elements at specific positions (0, k, 2k, ..., k*(k-1)) are filled with values from 1 to k, and the rest of the positions are not specified but do not affect the `result` string directly, the `result` will be a string containing the numbers 1 through k separated by spaces.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string containing the numbers 1 through k separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a string with the numbers 1 through k separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... (k-1) k**
