The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even. It then creates a list of length `n` called `permutation`. The function fills specific positions in this list with values from 1 to `k`, following a pattern based on `k`. Finally, it prints a string containing these values separated by spaces.
