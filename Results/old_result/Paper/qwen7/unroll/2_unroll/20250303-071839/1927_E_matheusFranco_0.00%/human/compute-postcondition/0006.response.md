Output State: `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, `k`, 2*k, ..., `k*(k/2)-1` are filled with values from 1 to `k/2`, and `curr_v` is `k/2 + 1`.

Explanation: The loop iterates `k` times. In each iteration `i`, it updates elements in the `permutation` list at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it reaches the end of the list. Since `k` is even, the loop will fill up to `k/2` blocks of size `k` in the `permutation` list, starting from index 0 and incrementing by `k` each time. Each block is filled sequentially with values from 1 to `k/2`. After the loop completes, `curr_v` will be `k/2 + 1`.
