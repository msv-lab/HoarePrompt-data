Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the case where Kirill needs to minimize the cost to move to a position within the first `m` positions. 

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4
  5 3
  7 3 6 9 2
  4 3 8 5 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - The optimal path for Kirill would be to move from position 5 to position 3, paying `b_4 = 8` coins for moving past position 4 and `a_3 = 6` coins for moving past position 3. Therefore, the total cost should be `8 + 6 = 14`.

However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate this. Let's break down the steps:

1. In `func_1`, the variables `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed, which is incorrect because the original order of the queue is from front to back.
2. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. It does not correctly account for the cost of moving through intermediate positions.

### Detailed Analysis:
- When `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the correct cost calculation should be:
  - Move from position 5 to position 4: Cost = `b_4 = 8`
  - Move from position 4 to position 3: Cost = `a_3 = 6`
  - Total cost = `8 + 6 = 14`

But the current implementation does not correctly compute this. For instance, the current implementation might incorrectly calculate the cost without properly considering the intermediate costs.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
