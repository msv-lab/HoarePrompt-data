You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Minimize the cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Moving from position `i` to `j` (where `j < i`) costs `a_j` coins.
   - For each intermediate position `k` (where `j < k < i`), it costs `b_k` coins.
3. **Strategy**: 
   - We need to find the optimal sequence of moves to minimize the total cost while ensuring Kirill ends up in one of the first `m` positions.

### Given Code Analysis
1. **func_1()**:
   - Takes input parameters `n` and `k`.
   - Reads lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` which represent `a_i` and `b_i` respectively.
   - Reverses these lists.
   - Initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
   - Iterates through the first `n-k` elements:
     - If `a_i < b_i`, update `pref` and reset `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, add `b_i` to `soma_b`.
   - For the remaining `k` elements, calculate the minimum cost to reach one of the first `m` positions.
2. **func_2()**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues Identified
1. **Reversing Lists**: The code reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This is unnecessary because the problem does not specify any ordering constraints on the indices.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The logic for updating `pref` and `soma_b` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:` is not correctly handling the cumulative cost calculation.
3. **Final Cost Calculation**: The final cost calculation in the loop is also incorrect. It should consider the cumulative cost of moving to the first `m` positions correctly.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate from the end of the queue towards the start.
2. Keep track of the minimum cost to reach the first `m` positions.
3. Use dynamic programming to store the minimum cost for each position.

### Corrected Code
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize DP array
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[n] = 0
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i + 1]) + a[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + k + 1)):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + sum(b[i:j]))
    
    print(dp[0])

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the function to run the tests
func_2()
```

### Conclusion
The original code is incorrect due to the flawed logic for cost calculation and unnecessary list reversals. The corrected approach uses dynamic programming to ensure the minimum cost is calculated correctly.
