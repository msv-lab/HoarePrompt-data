Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, and t has been assigned the value of int(input()).**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the specific value entered by the user.
