Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers, each representing the result of the mathematical expression `(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` for each iteration of the outer loop. Each result is calculated based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the summation of `f` over `m` iterations, with `t` being the total number of iterations. The calculations involve computing the greatest common divisor (gcd), simplifying fractions, and performing modular arithmetic using `M = 1000000007`.
