### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the program and verifies the mathematical steps involved. However, there are a few points that need further scrutiny:

1. **Formula Verification:**
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[
     \text{Expected value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f}\) represents the contribution of the friendship values when pairs are chosen.
     - The term \(m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\) accounts for the increase in friendship values due to reselection of already chosen pairs.
   - The denominator \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2\) normalizes the expected value.

2. **Simplification:**
   - The simplification steps are correct:
     \[
     2 \cdot k \cdot \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) = k \cdot n(n-1) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{4}
     \]

3. **GCD and Simplification:**
   - Using `math.gcd` to simplify the fraction is correct, ensuring the result is in its simplest form.

4. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The modular inverse calculation is necessary to handle large numbers and ensure the result is within the required modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, there is a subtle issue with the formula. The original assessment assumes that the formula directly gives the expected value, but it doesn't account for the fact that the expected value should be calculated per pair of children, not just the sum of friendship values.

### Corrected Formula:
The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \(k\) pairs chosen should be:
\[
\text{Expected value} = \frac{k \cdot \text{sum\_f} + \frac{m \cdot (k - 1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}}
\]
This formula accounts for the probability of each pair being chosen and the increase in friendship values due to reselection.

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation. The formula used in the program is incorrect, leading to potentially wrong results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
