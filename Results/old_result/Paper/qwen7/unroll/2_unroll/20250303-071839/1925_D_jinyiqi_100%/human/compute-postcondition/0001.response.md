Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, `M` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `10 ** 9 + 7` to the variable `M`. This does not affect the value of `t`, which remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4. Therefore, the output state includes both variables with their respective values and conditions.
