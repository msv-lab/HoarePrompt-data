Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `num = str(num)` converts the integer `num` into its string representation. Since `num` was originally an integer in the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9, now `num` holds a string that represents this integer. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
