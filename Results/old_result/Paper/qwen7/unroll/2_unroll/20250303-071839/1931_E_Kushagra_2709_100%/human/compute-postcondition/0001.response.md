Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9; `tot` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `tot` to 0. Since `num` was initially a string representation of an integer in the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9, its value remains unchanged. The only new information is that `tot` is now 0.
