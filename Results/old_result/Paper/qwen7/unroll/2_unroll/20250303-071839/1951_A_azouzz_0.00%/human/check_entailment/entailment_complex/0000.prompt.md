Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
import os def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end): # 获取当前目录下的所有子文件夹
current_dir = os.getcwd() subfolders = [f.path for f in
os.scandir(current_dir) if f.is_dir()] for folder in subfolders: #
检查文件夹名称是否在指定范围内 folder_name = os.path.basename(folder) if
folder_name.isdigit() and start <= int(folder_name) <= end: #
获取子文件夹中的所有.html文件 html_files = [f for f in os.listdir(folder) if
f.endswith('.html')] print(f"Folder '{folder}' contains {len(html_files)} HTML
files.") # 为每个.html文件生成对应的文件 for html_file in html_files: base_name =
os.path.splitext(html_file)[0] ac_file = os.path.join(folder,
f"{base_name}-ac.py") wa_file = os.path.join(folder, f"{base_name}-wa.py") #
创建文件 open(ac_file, 'w').close() open(wa_file, 'w').close() print(f"Generated
files: {ac_file}, {wa_file}") if __name__ == "__main__": # 指定目录范围 start_range
= 1951 end_range = 1980 generate_files_for_html_in_range(start_range,
end_range)

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both represent the inclusive range of folder names to process.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The specific sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a string `s`. It checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each input. Specifically, it prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in `s` is 2 or less, or if '11' does not appear in `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
