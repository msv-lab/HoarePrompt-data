Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python program that generates `.py` files (`ac.py` and `wa.py`) in specific folders containing `.html` files within a specified range of folder names. However, the given program `func_1` reads input from the user and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on conditions related to binary strings. This does not align with the task described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
