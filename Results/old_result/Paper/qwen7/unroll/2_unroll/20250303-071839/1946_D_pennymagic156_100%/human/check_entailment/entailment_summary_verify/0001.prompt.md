You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function calculates the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in the list `a` for each bit position from 29 to 0. It then returns the maximum value between this count and the length of the list `a`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x` using `func_1()`, which is correct.
   - It then reads the array `a` using `func_1()`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The function `func_5()` iterates over the bits from 29 down to 0 (since `x` is a 30-bit number).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks if both `u` (the `i`-th bit of `x`) and `v` (the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`) are zero. If so, it continues to the next bit.
     - If `u` is zero and `v` is odd, it returns the current answer `ans` because this configuration cannot form valid segments.
     - If `u` is zero and `v` is even, it processes the array to split it into segments where the XOR of the `i`-th bits is zero.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is odd, it skips to the next iteration.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is even, it counts the number of segments where the XOR of the `i`-th bits is zero.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is zero, it breaks out of the loop since no further segments can be formed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `v` is zero and `u` is one by breaking out of the loop, ensuring no further segments are considered.
   - The final result is the maximum count of segments found or the length of the array if no valid segments are found.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the maximum number of segments `k` or `-1` if no valid segments exist.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
