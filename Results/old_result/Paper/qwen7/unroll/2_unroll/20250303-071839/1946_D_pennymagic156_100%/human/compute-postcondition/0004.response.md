Output State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the least significant 30 bits of the values in `a`, `n` is the original value between 1 and 100000, `x` is the original integer between 0 and \(2^{30} - 1\), `a` is the return value of `func_1()`.

This output state describes that after executing the loop, the list `t` remains empty because no operations were performed on it within the loop. The variable `ans` holds the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the least significant 30 bits of the values in `a`. The variables `n` and `x` retain their original values, and `a` retains the value returned by `func_1()`.
