Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains `_` (a placeholder variable) and `times`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `times` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq times \leq 10^4\).
   - `check` is 2147483647.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `range(times)`, which means the loop will iterate `times` number of times.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will execute based on the value of `times`, we need to ensure that `times` is within its valid range.
   - The loop body is omitted, but the loop itself requires `times` to be a positive integer within the specified range to execute.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that `times` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq times \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`times` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq times \leq 10^4\), `check` is 2147483647**.
