Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and each `a_i` < 2^31). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases implicitly through its processing logic, where each test case contains a positive integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent integers `a_i` to process. The function then processes these integers according to unspecified conditions (not detailed here) and returns a result for each test case.
