Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4; `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value \(2^{31} - 1\) to the variable `check`. Since \(2^{31} - 1\) equals 2147483647, `check` is set to 2147483647. The value of `times` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
