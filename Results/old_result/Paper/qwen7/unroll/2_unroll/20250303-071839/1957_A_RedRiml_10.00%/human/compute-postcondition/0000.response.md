Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `w = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `w`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition of being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The variable `w` is now assigned the value of the input integer.
