Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an integer representing the number of iterations of the loop, each iteration processes a line `ln` (an integer) and a list of integers `palka`, and calculates the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times, printing the result of each iteration.
