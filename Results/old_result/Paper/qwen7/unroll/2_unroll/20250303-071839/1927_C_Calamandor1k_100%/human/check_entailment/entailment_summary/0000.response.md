Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary values (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`).
3. The function `func_1` processes each test case by creating sets of unique elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
4. It then calculates the number of unique elements in `a` and `b` that are relevant to the range `[1, k]`.
5. The program checks if there are more than `k // 2` elements in either `a` or `b` that are not shared between them. If so, it immediately concludes that it's not possible to choose the required elements and appends 'NO'.
6. It also checks if the total number of unique elements from both arrays is less than `k`. If so, it again concludes that it's not possible and appends 'NO'.
7. If neither of the above conditions is met, it concludes that it is possible to choose the required elements and appends 'YES'.

Based on the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
