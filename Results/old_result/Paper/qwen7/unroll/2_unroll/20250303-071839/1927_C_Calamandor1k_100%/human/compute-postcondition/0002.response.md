Output State: `results` is a list containing elements 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration of `cases`. The exact contents of the list depend on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` in each iteration of the loop. If the conditions are met for a given iteration, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.
