Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even. Additionally, for each test case, there are n integers in the second list of the tuple representing array a, and m integers in the third list of the tuple representing array b, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.**
