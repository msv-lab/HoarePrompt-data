Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains five elements: `n`, `m`, and `k` (all integers), and two lists `a` and `b`. For each tuple in `cases`, the function checks specific conditions involving sets derived from `a` and `b`. If these conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function returns the results list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases`.**
