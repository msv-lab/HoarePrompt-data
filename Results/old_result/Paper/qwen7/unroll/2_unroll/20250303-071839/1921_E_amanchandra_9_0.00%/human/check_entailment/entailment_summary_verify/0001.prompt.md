You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of grid dimensions \(h\) and \(w\), and two points \((x_a, y_a)\) and \((x_b, y_b)\). For each test case, it determines the winner based on the relative positions of these points within the grid. If \(x_a\) is greater than \(x_b\), it outputs 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the midpoint between \(x_a\) and \(x_b\) and checks the vertical positions of \((x_a, y_a)\) and \((x_b, y_b)\) to decide between 'Alice' and 'Bob'. The function outputs a series of lines, each containing 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', corresponding to the outcome of each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the dimensions of the board (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`).

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`. If this condition is true, it prints "Draw". This part is correct because if Alice starts higher than Bob, neither can capture the other since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`, which represents half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob.
   - It then checks if `abs(xa - xb)` is odd using `if abs(xa - xb) % 2:`. This is necessary because the parity (odd or even nature) of the distance affects the outcome.
     - If the distance is odd, it sets the boundaries for Bob's possible moves (`l` and `r`).
     - It then checks if Alice can capture Bob within these boundaries.
     - If the distance is even, it sets the boundaries for Alice's possible moves and checks if Bob can capture Alice within these boundaries.

4. **Boundary Calculations:**
   - The boundaries `l` and `r` are calculated based on the distance `x` and the current position of Bob (`yb`).
   - The program then checks if Alice can capture Bob within the range `[l, r]` when the distance is odd, and similarly for Bob when the distance is even.

5. **Capture Check:**
   - The program uses `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` to check if Alice can capture Bob when the distance is odd.
   - Similarly, it uses `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` to check if Bob can capture Alice when the distance is even.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It handles the different scenarios (even and odd distances) appropriately and correctly determines the outcome based on the positions and movements of the chips.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
