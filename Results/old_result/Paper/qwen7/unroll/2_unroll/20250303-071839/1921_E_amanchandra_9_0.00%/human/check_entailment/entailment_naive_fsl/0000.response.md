Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic. Specifically, the program does not handle all possible movements and outcomes as described in the problem statement. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Movement Logic**: The program incorrectly calculates the possible moves for Alice and Bob. The program uses a simplified approach to determine the outcome based on the distance between Alice and Bob, which does not account for all valid moves and their outcomes.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not consider all edge cases, such as when Alice or Bob is in the boundary rows and cannot move further. The program also does not handle the diagonal movements correctly, which are crucial for determining the outcome of the game.

3. **Simplified Outcome Determination**: The program simplifies the outcome determination to a few conditions without considering all possible scenarios. For example, it does not properly simulate the game until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific example where the program fails:

### Example:
- **Input**: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
- **Expected Output**: `Alice` (since Alice can move down-right to capture Bob's position)

However, the provided program does not correctly simulate this scenario and instead outputs `Draw`.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and fails to handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
