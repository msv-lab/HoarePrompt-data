Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Instead, it counts the number of 0s and 1s in the string and calculates a value `ans` based on these counts. This approach does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts or the goal of sorting the string.
3. The function does not handle the substrings or the actual cyclic shifts as required by the problem statement.
4. The function does not compute the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string, which is the core requirement of the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
