Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the binary string `s`. If `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4, it performs the calculation; otherwise, it does not process the test case. The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing the calculated value `ans` for the respective test case.**
