You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and s_i ∈ {0, 1}.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is the sum of counts calculated from the input lists `s` after executing the loop for `n` times. Each `ans` value is determined based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the list `s` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the binary string `s`. If `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4, it performs the calculation; otherwise, it does not process the test case. The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing the calculated value `ans` for the respective test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to count the number of inversions in the string but does not account for the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. The correct output should be `9`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the program will not produce this result because it does not simulate the process of performing cyclic shifts and calculating their costs.

To verify, let's walk through the example:

1. Start with the string `101011`.
2. To sort the string, we need to perform the following cyclic shifts:
   - Shift the substring `[3, 5]` (i.e., `101011` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 3.
   - Shift the substring `[6, 6]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[7, 7]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[8, 8]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[9, 9]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[10, 10]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[11, 11]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.
   - Shift the substring `[12, 12]` (i.e., `101101` -> `101101`), which has a cost of 1.

The total cost is `3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9`.

The provided program does not simulate these shifts and thus cannot produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
