Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5. For each test case, the function returns either an error message if `t` is out of the specified range or a result based on the binary string `s`.**
