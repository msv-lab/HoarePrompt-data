Output State: The value of `T` is reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop have finished. For each iteration `t` from 0 to `T-1`, the loop processes the inputs `a` and `b`, calculates the sum `suma` based on these inputs, and prints `suma - 1`. The final state of `T` is 0 since it starts from 1 and is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
