### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to the sum `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Annotation Explanation:**
   - The annotation suggests that the program calculates the sum based on a specific formula but does not mention how this formula relates to the problem's requirements.
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not directly correspond to checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Manual Verification:
Let's manually verify the logic with the example provided in the original assessment: \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\).

- Valid pairs according to the problem description: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((1, 4)\), \((2, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 3)\), \((3, 6)\).

Now, let's see how the program processes these pairs:
- For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((1, 3)\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((1, 4)\): \(1 + 4 = 5\) and \(4 \cdot \gcd(1, 4) = 4\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\), which is a multiple.
- For \((2, 4)\): \(2 + 4 = 6\) and \(4 \cdot \gcd(2, 4) = 8\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((3, 3)\): \(3 + 3 = 6\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 9\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((3, 6)\): \(3 + 6 = 9\) and \(6 \cdot \gcd(3, 6) = 18\), which is not a multiple.

The program indeed fails to correctly identify the valid pairs, as shown in the manual verification.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

**Final: False**
