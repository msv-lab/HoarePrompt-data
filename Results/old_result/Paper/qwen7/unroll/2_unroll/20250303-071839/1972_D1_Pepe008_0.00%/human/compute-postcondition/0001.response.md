Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for t in range(T)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `t` and `T`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: Before the loop starts, `t` is not yet defined or initialized within the loop context. However, the loop will start with `t` being set to 0 (since `range(T)` generates numbers from 0 to T-1).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t < T`. Therefore, `T` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start.

Given the initial state where `T` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, we need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `T` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
