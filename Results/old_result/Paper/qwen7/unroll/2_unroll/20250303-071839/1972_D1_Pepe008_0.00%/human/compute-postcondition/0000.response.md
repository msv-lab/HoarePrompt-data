Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is later renamed to `T`) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the value of `T` will still satisfy this condition after the code is executed. The other conditions and constraints regarding `n` and `m` remain unchanged and are still valid.
