Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific logic in the function definition, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases defined by `t`, and for each test case, it processes `x` and `y` to produce a result. However, without more details on the exact processing logic, the primary focus is on the parameters and the structure implied by the test cases.
