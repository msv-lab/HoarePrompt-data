You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):

                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]

                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, n is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, each iteration of the loop processes an input integer m and an array arr of length m, and prints 'NO' or 'YES' based on whether the array can be sorted by swapping at most one pair of adjacent elements.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, indicating initially that the array can be sorted.
   
3. **Checking Array Order:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the array to the beginning.
   - For each pair of consecutive elements, it checks if the current element (`arr[i-1]`) is greater than the next element (`arr[i]`).
   - If it finds such a pair, it splits the larger element into its digits and checks if rearranging these digits can make the sequence non-decreasing.
   - If rearranging the digits does not result in a non-decreasing sequence, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   
4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints "YES" if `ans` is `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The program attempts to split the larger element into its digits and check if rearranging them makes the sequence non-decreasing.
   - However, the logic for splitting and checking is flawed. The program directly concatenates the digits of `arr[i-1]` with `arr[i]` without considering the actual rearrangement needed to make the sequence non-decreasing.
   - For example, if `arr[i-1] = 45` and `arr[i] = 67`, the program will concatenate `[4, 5] + [67]` but should instead check if rearranging `[4, 5, 6, 7]` can form a non-decreasing sequence.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that splitting the digits and concatenating them will solve the problem. Instead, it needs to consider all possible ways to split and rearrange the digits to achieve a non-decreasing sequence.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
