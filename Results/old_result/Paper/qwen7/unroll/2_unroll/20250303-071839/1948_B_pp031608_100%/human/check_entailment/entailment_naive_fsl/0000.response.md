Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the array can be made sorted after applying the operation multiple times. Specifically, consider the input:

```
4
12 3 45 67
```

- The program checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and tries to split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and compare them.
- However, the program only performs one split operation per element and does not recursively check if further splits could make the array sorted.

For the given example `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program would incorrectly determine that it cannot be sorted because it only checks one split operation and does not account for the possibility of further splits making the array sorted.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to recursively check all possible splits of elements until the array is sorted or determine that it is impossible to sort the array.
