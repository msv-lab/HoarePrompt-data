Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if an array can be sorted by performing a specific operation any number of times.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic. It attempts to check if the array can be sorted by swapping at most one pair of adjacent elements, which is not equivalent to the problem's requirement.
3. Specifically, the solution checks if the array can be made sorted by ensuring that for each pair of adjacent elements, the second element is not less than the first after splitting the first element into its digits. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of repeatedly splitting elements until the array is sorted.
4. The correct approach would involve repeatedly applying the digit-splitting operation until no further changes can be made and then checking if the resulting array is sorted.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
