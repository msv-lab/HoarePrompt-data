### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits and inserting those digits back into the array in their original order.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

#### Function Summary:
The provided summary is incorrect. The function does not check if the array can be sorted by splitting elements multiple times. Instead, it only checks if a single split operation can make the array sorted.

#### Analysis:
1. **Single Split Operation**: The program only performs a single split operation on `arr[i - 1]` and checks if the resulting array is sorted. This is insufficient because the problem requires checking all possible splits recursively.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in the loop is flawed. It only considers one split operation and does not explore further splits. For example, in the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program would split `45` into `[4, 5]` and check if `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]` is sorted. However, it should also consider further splits like splitting `67` into `[6, 7]`.

3. **Recursive Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, a recursive approach is needed. We need to check all possible splits of elements and see if the array can be sorted through these operations.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the problem requirements and thus is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not recursively check all possible splits of elements to determine if the array can be sorted.
