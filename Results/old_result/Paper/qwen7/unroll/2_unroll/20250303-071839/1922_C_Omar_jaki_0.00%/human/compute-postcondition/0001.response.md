Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is a lambda function that returns a map of integers from input split by spaces, `t` is now the first element returned by the lambda function `r()`**.

This means that `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input split by spaces, while `r` remains unchanged as it is a lambda function.
