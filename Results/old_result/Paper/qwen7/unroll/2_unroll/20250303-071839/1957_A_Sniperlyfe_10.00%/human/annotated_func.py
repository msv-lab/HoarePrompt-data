#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a stick length from the original list `arr`, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that stick length in the list.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where each frequency is the value associated with a stick length in the dictionary `freq`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates the frequency of each stick length in the list and returns the sum of these frequencies divided by 4.
