Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not change the values of the elements in `arr`, so the initial state of `arr` remains unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `freq`, which is an empty dictionary.
