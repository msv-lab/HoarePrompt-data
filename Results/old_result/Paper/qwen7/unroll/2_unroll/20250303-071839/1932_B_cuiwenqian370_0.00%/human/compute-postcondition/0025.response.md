Output State: **`path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `dp[0]` is either 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', or 0 otherwise, `dp[1]` is `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`**.

This means that the first element of `dp` remains unchanged based on the first character of `path`. The second element of `dp` is updated to be the sum of the first element of `dp` and 1 if the second character of `path` is '@', or 0 if the second character is not '@'.
