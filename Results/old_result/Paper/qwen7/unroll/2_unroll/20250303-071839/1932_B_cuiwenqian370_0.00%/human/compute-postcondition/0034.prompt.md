You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where the length of the string is at least 1.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is not equal to 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '*', then the first element of `dp` is set to -inf. Otherwise, the first element of `dp` remains 0.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is set to 1. If the first character of `path` is '*', then the first element of `dp` is set to -inf. Otherwise, the first element of `dp` remains 0.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :

        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` elements. The first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', or 0 otherwise. The second element of `dp` is -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', 1 if the second character of `path` is '@', or `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)` if the second character is neither '@' nor '*'.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` elements. The first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', or 0 otherwise. For each subsequent element `dp[i]` (where `i > 0`), it is -inf if the `(i+1)`-th character of `path` is '*', 1 if the `(i+1)`-th character of `path` is '@', or `dp[i-1] + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)` if the `(i+1)`-th character is neither '@' nor '*'.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: dp is a list where each element dp[i] (for i > 1) is calculated based on the characters in the string 'path'. If the (i+1)-th character is '*', dp[i] is set to -inf. If the (i+1)-th character is '@', dp[i] is set to 1. Otherwise, dp[i] is the maximum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] plus 1 if the (i+1)-th character is '@', or 0 otherwise. The first element of dp is 1 if the first character of path is '@', -inf if the first character of path is '*', or 0 otherwise.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter path, which is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value in the list dp that is greater than negative infinity.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
