Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be designed to solve a different problem, possibly related to dynamic programming with some form of path or sequence analysis, but not the one described in the problem statement about the Chaya tribe's signs of the apocalypse.

The problem requires finding the year when all signs will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. However, the provided code is trying to process some kind of path or sequence data (`@` and `*`) which is not relevant to the problem at hand. Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the specified problem.
