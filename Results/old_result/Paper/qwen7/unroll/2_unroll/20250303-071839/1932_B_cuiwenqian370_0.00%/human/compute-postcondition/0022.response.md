Output State: **`path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1 if the first character of `path` is '@' or -inf if the first character is '*', and the second element of `dp` is -inf.**

Explanation: The code `dp[1] = -float('inf')` sets the second element of the list `dp` to `-inf`. The first element of `dp` was previously set to 1 if the first character of `path` is '@' or -inf if the first character is '*'. The length of `path` (`n`) and the fact that the second character of `path` is '*' remain unchanged.
