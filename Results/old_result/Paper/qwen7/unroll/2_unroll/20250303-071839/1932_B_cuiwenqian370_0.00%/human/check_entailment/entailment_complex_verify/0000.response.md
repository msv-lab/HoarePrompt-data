### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not solving the problem as described. The problem requires determining the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a different problem involving paths with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the given problem.

Let's break down the provided code and its behavior:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a string `path` consisting of '@' and '*' characters.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` where each element depends on the characters in `path`.
   - The function returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than negative infinity.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, it is clear that the functions are not performing the required calculations. They are instead solving a different problem, which is why the original assessment is correct.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment accurately identifies that the provided program is incorrect for the given problem description. The functions do not implement the logic needed to determine the year of the apocalypse based on the periodicities of the signs.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described.
