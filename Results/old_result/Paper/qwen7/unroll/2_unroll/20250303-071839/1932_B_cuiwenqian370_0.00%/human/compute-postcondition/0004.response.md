Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, `n`, or `index`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values and states.
