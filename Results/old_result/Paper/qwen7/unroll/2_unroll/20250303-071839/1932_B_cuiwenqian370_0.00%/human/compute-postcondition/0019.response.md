Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is set to 1. If the first character of `path` is '*', then the first element of `dp` is set to -inf. Otherwise, the first element of `dp` remains 0. The length of `path` is greater than 1.
