Functionality: The function processes multiple grids (up to 100 grids) where each grid is defined by n lines, each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). For each grid, it checks if the '1's form a triangle or a square. If any line contains exactly one '1', it outputs 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, it outputs 'SQUARE'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything; instead, it directly prints the result for each grid.
