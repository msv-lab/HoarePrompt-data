### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the problem statement. Let's verify this step-by-step using the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program uses `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through possible splits of the array.
   - For each split at index `i`, it checks:
     - Whether the prefix `[a[0], ..., a[i-1]]` is greater than or equal to the suffix `[a[i], ..., a[n-1]]` at the start.
     - Whether the suffix is sorted.
   - If such a split exists where the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - If no such split exists, it prints 'NO'.

### Verification Against Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1 4 5 1 4`
   - The array is not sorted, and there is no way to split it such that the resulting array becomes sorted. Therefore, the output should be 'NO'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'NO'.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 9 2 2 3`
   - The array can be split into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]`, and then swapped to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`, which is sorted. Therefore, the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `1 2 3`
   - The array is already sorted. Therefore, the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The logic for checking if the array is already sorted is correct.
  - The logic for handling unsorted arrays by splitting and swapping is also correct. The program checks if the prefix is greater than or equal to the suffix and if the suffix is sorted, which aligns with the problem requirements.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases like arrays that are already sorted and arrays that cannot be sorted by any split and swap operation correctly.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the detailed analysis and verification against the test cases, the program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
