You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: The output will be 'YES' if the sequence `a` is either non-decreasing or can be split into two segments where the first segment is non-decreasing and the second segment is non-increasing, otherwise it will be 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be split into two segments: a non-decreasing segment followed by a non-increasing segment. If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, but `t` is not an explicit parameter of the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.
   
2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program uses `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through possible splits of the array.
   - For each split at index `i`, it checks:
     - Whether the prefix `[a[0], ..., a[i-1]]` is greater than or equal to the suffix `[a[i], ..., a[n-1]]` at the start.
     - Whether the suffix is sorted.
   - If such a split exists where the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - If no such split exists, it prints 'NO'.

### Verification Against Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1 4 5 1 4`
   - The array is not sorted, and there is no way to split it such that the resulting array becomes sorted. Therefore, the output should be 'NO'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'NO'.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 9 2 2 3`
   - The array can be split into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]`, and then swapped to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`, which is sorted. Therefore, the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `1 2 3`
   - The array is already sorted. Therefore, the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the problem statement. It accurately determines whether the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts of the array.
