Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify arrays that can become non-decreasing after performing the specified operation. Let's consider the following example:

For the input:
```
3
4
1 3 2 4
2
1 2
3
3 2 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
Yes
Yes
No
```

However, the program will output:
```
No
Yes
Yes
```

The issue lies in the way the program checks if the array can become non-decreasing. The current implementation only checks if the array is already non-decreasing or if the first element of the array is greater than or equal to the last element of the suffix. This approach is insufficient because it does not account for all possible splits and swaps that could make the array non-decreasing.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible splits and verify if swapping those parts can result in a non-decreasing array. The current implementation does not cover all such cases, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.
