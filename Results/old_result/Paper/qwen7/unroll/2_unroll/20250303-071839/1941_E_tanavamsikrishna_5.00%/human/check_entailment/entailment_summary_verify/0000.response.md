### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its components to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost of placing supports in a single row of the river, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Here's what the function does:

1. It iterates through the row and increments the cost of the first `d-1` cells by 1.
2. For the remaining cells, it calculates the cost as the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells plus 1.

However, the function does not enforce the constraint that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. Instead, it simply ensures that there is at least one support in the first and last columns and then calculates the cost based on the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells. This approach does not guarantee that the distance between supports is respected.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` processes the entire input and uses `func_1` to transform each row into a cost array. It then finds the minimum sum of any `k` consecutive elements from these cost arrays.

Given the issues in `func_1`, the overall logic of `func_2` is flawed because it relies on an incorrect calculation of the cost for each row.

#### Function Summary:
The summary states that the function calculates the minimum sum of any `k` consecutive elements from a transformed version of the `rows` list, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` on the corresponding row and the parameter `d`. The function then prints this minimum sum and returns nothing.

This summary aligns with the original assessment. The key issue is that `func_1` does not correctly enforce the distance constraint between supports, leading to an incorrect cost calculation.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges because `func_1` does not properly handle the distance constraint between supports.

**Final: False**
