### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Initial State**: `row` is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports.
- **First Loop**: For the first `d-1` elements, the function increments each by 1. This ensures that the first `d-1` supports are placed.
- **Second Loop**: For the remaining elements, the function sets each element to the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus its original value plus 1. This step is intended to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

However, there is a critical issue with the second loop. The function does not correctly enforce the constraint that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. Instead, it only ensures that the distance is no more than `d` when looking back `d` elements, but it does not ensure that the actual placement of supports respects this constraint.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Input Parameters**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are read from input, and `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells.
- **Cost Calculation**: The function calls `func_1` on each row to get the cost of placing supports in that row. Then, it calculates the total cost for each possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
- **Output**: The minimum total cost is printed.

Given the issues identified in `func_1`, the overall approach of `func_2` is flawed because it relies on an incorrect cost calculation for each row.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges because the `func_1` function does not properly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
