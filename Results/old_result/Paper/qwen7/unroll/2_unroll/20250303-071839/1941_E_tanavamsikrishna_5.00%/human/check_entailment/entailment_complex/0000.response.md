Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of river depths and ensures that the cost of installing supports meets the specified conditions.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1.
   - For each subsequent element, it sets the value to the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus 1.
   - The function returns the last element of the processed row, which represents the total cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire grid of river depths.
   - It calls `func_1` on each row to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then computes the minimum cost of installing supports for any `k` consecutive rows by summing up the costs of those rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost found.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, let's verify the correctness:
- The problem requires minimizing the total cost of installing supports across `k` consecutive rows.
- `func_1` correctly calculates the cost for a single row based on the given constraints.
- `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each row and then finds the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

Since both functions are implemented according to the problem requirements and the logic seems sound, the overall program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
