Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which contains n lists, each with m positive integers. The function returns a value based on certain conditions involving these parameters and the list.**

To break it down:
- The function `func_2` accepts four integer parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
- There are constraints on these parameters: `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`, `3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5`, and `1 ≤ d ≤ m`.
- The function also accepts a list called `rows`, which consists of `n` lists. Each of these inner lists has `m` positive integers.
- The first and last elements of each inner list in `rows` are guaranteed to be 0.
- Based on the given parameters and the list `rows`, the function returns a specific value, though the exact nature of the return value is not detailed in the provided information.
