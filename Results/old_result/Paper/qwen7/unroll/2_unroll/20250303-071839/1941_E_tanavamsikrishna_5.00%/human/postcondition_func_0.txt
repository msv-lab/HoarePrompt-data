The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It updates each element in the list such that the first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1, and each subsequent element is set to the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus its original value plus 1. Finally, it returns the last element of the updated list `row`.
