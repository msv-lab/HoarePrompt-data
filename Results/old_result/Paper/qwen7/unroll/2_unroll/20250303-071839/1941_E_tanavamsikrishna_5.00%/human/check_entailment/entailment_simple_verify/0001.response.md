### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`
1. **Initial Setup**: The function starts by incrementing the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1.
2. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each element starting from `d-1` to the end of the row, it calculates the minimum cost required to place a support at that position. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:
- **Increment Initial Elements**: The first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1.
- **Update Remaining Elements**: Each subsequent element is updated to be the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus its original value plus 1. This ensures that the distance constraint is maintained.

#### Function `func_2`
1. **Input Parsing**: Reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from the input, followed by the `n` rows of the river.
2. **Cost Calculation**: Applies `func_1` to each row to compute the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: Iterates through the list of costs for each possible starting row of the `k` bridges and calculates the sum of costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
4. **Result Output**: Prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
- **Correctness**: The function correctly handles the initial increment and the dynamic programming update to ensure the distance constraint is maintained. The final cost returned is the total cost for that row.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Correctness**: The function correctly processes each row to find the minimum cost of installing supports and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows. The logic for calculating the minimum total cost is sound and matches the problem requirements.
