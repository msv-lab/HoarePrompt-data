### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: `row` is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports.
2. **First Loop**: For each cell from index 0 to `d-2`, increment the cell's value by 1.
   - This ensures that the first `d-1` cells have a cost of 1.
3. **Second Loop**: For each cell from index `d-1` to the end of the list:
   - If the cell is not the first cell (`i > 0`), set the cell's value to the minimum value of the previous `d` cells plus 1.
   - If the cell is the first cell (`i == 0`), set the cell's value to 0.
   - Add 1 to the cell's value.
   - This ensures that the cost is calculated based on the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells plus 1.

The function `func_1` aims to calculate the minimum cost for placing supports in a row while ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the implementation does not correctly enforce the distance constraint because it only considers the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells, which does not guarantee the optimal placement of supports.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: Read the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and the depths of the river cells for each row.
2. **Cost Calculation**: For each row, calculate the cost of placing supports using `func_1`.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: For each possible starting row for the bridges, calculate the total cost of placing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
4. **Result Output**: Print the minimum total cost among all possible starting rows.

The main issue with the program is that `func_1` does not correctly enforce the distance constraint between supports. The function `func_1` only ensures that the cost is based on the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells, which does not guarantee the optimal placement of supports.

Given the example input:
```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
```

The correct approach would involve dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost for placing supports while maintaining the required distance between them. The current implementation does not enforce this constraint.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges because it does not properly enforce the distance constraint between supports.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
