State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder and does not need adjustment.
2. The variable `t` controls the number of iterations of the loop. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.
3. The variable `n` is mentioned in the problem statement but does not directly control the loop's execution. However, it is given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), which is a constraint on `n` but not necessary for the loop to execute.
4. Since the loop head only involves `t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1, while `n` remains within its specified range.
