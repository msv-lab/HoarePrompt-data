### Reasoning:

The annotated program does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling**:
   - The main loop `for _ in range(int(input()))` is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, which means it relies on global variables that are not defined in the provided context. This is incorrect because the function should take the necessary inputs as arguments.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes no arguments, but it attempts to read `n` and `k` from `input()`. This is problematic because the function should be able to handle different test cases independently.
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not correctly simulate the process of Alice buying jewels from multiple stalls. Specifically:
     - If `n < k`, it correctly prints "NO".
     - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `n`, which is correct.
     - If `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", `2`, and `n - k + 1` followed by `1`. This part is also correct.
     - However, if `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`, it incorrectly prints "NO". This is incorrect because even in this case, Bob can still set up stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not output the number of stalls and the prices for each stall as required. Instead, it only prints "YES" or "NO" and some values that are not formatted according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
