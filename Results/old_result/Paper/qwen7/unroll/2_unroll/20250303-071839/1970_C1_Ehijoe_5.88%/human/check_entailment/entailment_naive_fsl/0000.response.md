Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game logic for all potential cases. Specifically, the program assumes that the tree can always be represented as a deque and that the starting node will always be one of the two leaves. However, the problem description states that the tree can be seen as an array, but it does not guarantee that the starting node will always be one of the leaves. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
3
```

In this case, the tree is structured such that node 3 is neither a leaf nor the starting node. The program will incorrectly handle this case because it assumes the tree can be represented as a deque and that the starting node will always be one of the leaves. This assumption leads to incorrect indexing and potentially incorrect move calculations.

To correctly handle all potential cases, the program needs to ensure that it can handle any starting node and correctly calculate the minimum moves to the nearest leaf for both players.
