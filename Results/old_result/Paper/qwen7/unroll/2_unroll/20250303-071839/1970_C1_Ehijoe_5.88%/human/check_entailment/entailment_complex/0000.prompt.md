Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: `empty` is False, `t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `tree` is a deque with elements added based on the given conditions. The `tree` deque will contain pairs of integers `(u, v)` or `(v, u)` depending on their positions in the input, with the first element always being `u` and the second element being `v` or vice versa if they match the conditions specified in the loop.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: Postcondition: `empty` is False, `t` is an input integer, `u` is `min(t, idx)`, `v` is `min(t, n - idx - 1)`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `tree` is a deque with elements added based on the given conditions, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`. If there exists at least one move in `moves` which is odd, then no specific changes are mentioned. If all moves in `moves` are even numbers, then no specific changes are mentioned as well.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a tree structure defined by a series of edges and determines whether a player (Ron or Hermione) wins based on a given number of moves \( t \). It reads the number of nodes \( n \), the number of moves \( t \), and the starting node. The function then builds a deque representing the tree based on the input edges. After identifying the index of the starting node within this deque, it calculates two possible moves and checks if either of them is odd. If at least one move is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'.
