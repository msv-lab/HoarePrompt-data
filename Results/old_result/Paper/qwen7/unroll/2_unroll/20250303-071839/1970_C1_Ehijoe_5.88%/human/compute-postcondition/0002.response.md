Output State: **`empty` is True, `t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `tree` is an empty deque.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, and `tree` remain unchanged from their initial states.
