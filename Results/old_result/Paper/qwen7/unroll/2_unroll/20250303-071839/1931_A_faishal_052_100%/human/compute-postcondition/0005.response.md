Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is typically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < cases`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `cases` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and that `cases` is a positive integer such that the loop can start executing.

Given the initial state:
- `info` is a list containing up to 100 lists. Each inner list contains four elements: two integers between 1 and 26 inclusive, followed by either 1 or 26, and finally an integer between 0 and 78 inclusive. The last element in each inner list is sorted.

We need to focus on adjusting the states of `i` and `cases`.

**State:**
- `i` should be 0.
- `cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) to ensure the loop can start executing.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `cases` must be a positive integer**
