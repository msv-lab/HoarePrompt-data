You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each case involves an integer `lex`. It processes `lex` based on its value, sorts a list containing processed values, and converts the first three elements of each processed list into corresponding lowercase letters. Finally, it prints these letter strings for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into three letters.
   - It uses a series of conditional checks to determine the values of the letters:
     - If `lex < 28`, it sets the first letter to 'a' (1) and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it sets the second letter to 'z' (26) and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it sets the third letter to 'z' (26) and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Finally, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to the list.

3. **Sorting and Conversion:**
   - The list `arr` is sorted.
   - Each value in the list is converted to the corresponding character using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and concatenated to form the word.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic used to determine the values of the letters is flawed. For instance, if `lex` is between 28 and 51, the program does not correctly handle these values.
   - The program assumes that the first two letters will always be 'a' and 'z', which is not true. There can be other combinations that yield the same encoded value.

2. **Sorting Before Conversion:**
   - Sorting the list before converting it to characters is unnecessary and incorrect. The correct approach should directly convert the values to characters without sorting.

3. **Handling All Possible Combinations:**
   - The program does not consider all possible combinations of letters that can sum up to the given encoded value. For example, for `lex = 24`, the correct answer should be "aaa" (1+1+1=3), not "aav".

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate all possible combinations of three letters that sum up to the given encoded value and choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Corrected Program

```python
from itertools import product

def find_smallest_word(lex):
    min_word = None
    for a, b, c in product(range(1, 27), repeat=3):
        if a + b + c == lex:
            word = f"{chr(a + 96)}{chr(b + 96)}{chr(c + 96)}"
            if min_word is None or word < min_word:
                min_word = word
    return min_word

def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        print(find_smallest_word(lex))

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to flawed decoding logic and unnecessary sorting. The corrected program generates all possible combinations of three letters and finds the lexicographically smallest one that sums up to the given encoded value.
