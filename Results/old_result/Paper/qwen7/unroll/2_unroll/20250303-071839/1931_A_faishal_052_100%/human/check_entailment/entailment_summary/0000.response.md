Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded for each test case. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Processing Logic**: The current logic does not correctly handle the conversion of the encoded integer back into a three-letter word. Specifically, the conditions used to append values to the `arr` list are incorrect and do not cover all possible cases.

2. **Sorting and Conversion**: After processing, the list `arr` is sorted, which is unnecessary since we want the lexicographically smallest word. Additionally, the sorting step might interfere with the correct order needed for the smallest word.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `lex` is less than 28 or greater than 78. These cases need to be handled separately.

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the first character
        if lex >= 27:
            first_char = 1
            lex -= 26
        else:
            first_char = lex
            lex = 0
        
        # Determine the second character
        if lex >= 27:
            second_char = 1
            lex -= 26
        else:
            second_char = lex
            lex = 0
        
        # Determine the third character
        third_char = lex
        
        # Convert numbers to characters
        word = ''.join(chr(char + 96) for char in [first_char, second_char, third_char])
        print(word)

# Example usage
func()
```

With this corrected version:
- We directly determine the first, second, and third characters based on the value of `lex`.
- We ensure that the characters are chosen in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order.
- We convert the numbers to characters using `chr(char + 96)`.

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
