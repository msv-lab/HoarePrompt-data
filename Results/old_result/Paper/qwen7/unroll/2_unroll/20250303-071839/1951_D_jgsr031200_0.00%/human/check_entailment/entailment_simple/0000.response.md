### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided example cases.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case**: When `n == k`, the function prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of `1` coin. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is `1` coin and she has `k` coins.

3. **Case When `n < k`**: The function prints "NO" and returns immediately. This is correct because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer than `k` coins.

4. **Case When `n >= k`**: The function calculates the prices for the stalls using the following logic:
   - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It iterates over these costs and calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
   - It sums up the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`).

5. **Output Validation**:
   - If `h < k`, it prints "NO". This is correct because if the total number of jewels Alice can buy is less than `k`, it means it's impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `h >= k`, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls `2`, followed by the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is also correct because setting up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels:
     - In the first stall, Alice buys `n // (n - k + 1)` jewels, leaving her with `n % (n - k + 1)` coins.
     - In the second stall, Alice buys `n // 1` jewels, but since she only has `n % (n - k + 1)` coins, she buys exactly `n % (n - k + 1)` jewels, ensuring the total is `k`.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `7 3`
  - Output: `YES 10`
  - Explanation: Alice buys 3 jewels at a price of 2 coins each, leaving her with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any more jewels.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6 4`
  - Output: `NO`
  - Explanation: Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with 6 coins.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `255 8`
  - Output: `YES 8`
  - Explanation: Alice buys 8 jewels at prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]` respectively.

The code handles all edge cases and examples correctly. Therefore, the provided implementation is correct.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
