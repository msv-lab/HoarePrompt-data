### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
- Alice buys greedily from the stalls in order.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - **Case 1**: If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1. This is correct because Alice would buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is 1.
   - **Case 2**: If `n < k`, the program prints "NO". This is also correct because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than `k`.
   - **Case 3**: If `n >= k`, the program calculates the prices of the stalls using the formula `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]` and checks if the sum of the quantities Alice can buy from these stalls is at least `k`.

2. **Stall Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the quantity Alice can buy from each stall using `curr = n // i` and updates `n` accordingly.
   - However, the program only considers 2 stalls (`costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`) and does not handle cases where more than 2 stalls are needed.

3. **Stall Limit**:
   - The program does not check if the number of stalls exceeds 60. Since it only considers 2 stalls, this part is not violated, but the logic is flawed.

4. **Pricing Logic**:
   - The pricing logic is flawed because it does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, with `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program should set up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

#### Example Test Case:
- **Input**: `255 8`
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  8
  128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  NO
  ```

The program fails to correctly handle the scenario where more than 2 stalls are needed. It incorrectly prints "NO" instead of setting up the necessary stalls.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the case where the number of stalls needed exceeds 2, and the logic for determining the prices of the stalls is flawed.

**Final: False**
