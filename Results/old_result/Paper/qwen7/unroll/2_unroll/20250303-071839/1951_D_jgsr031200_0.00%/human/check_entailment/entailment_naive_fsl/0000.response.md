Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the number of stalls needed exceeds 60. Additionally, the logic for determining the prices of the stalls is flawed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Stall Count**: The program attempts to set up only 2 stalls (`print(2)`), which is insufficient for many cases. For instance, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program incorrectly prints `NO` because it does not consider setting up more than 2 stalls.

2. **Incorrect Pricing Logic**: The logic for calculating the prices of the stalls is flawed. It does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, with `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program should set up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

To fix these issues, the program needs to:
- Ensure that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
- Correctly calculate the prices of the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Here is an example where the program fails:
- Input: `255 8`
- Expected Output: 
  ```
  YES
  8
  128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where more than 2 stalls are needed, leading to incorrect results.
