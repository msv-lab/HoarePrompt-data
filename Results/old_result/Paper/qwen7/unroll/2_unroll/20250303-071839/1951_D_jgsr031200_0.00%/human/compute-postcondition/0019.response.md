Based on the initial state provided:

- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs`, which means `h = n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and `h`.

Output: **YES**
