Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the sequence `costs`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - `costs` is given as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `h` is given as `0`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `costs`, the initial value of `i` should be set to the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.
   - The list `costs` itself must exist and contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the Given State**:
   - `costs` is already defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`, so it meets the requirement of containing at least one element.
   - `h` is not directly involved in the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i` to the first element of `costs`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`costs` is [n - k + 1, 1], `i` is n - k + 1**
