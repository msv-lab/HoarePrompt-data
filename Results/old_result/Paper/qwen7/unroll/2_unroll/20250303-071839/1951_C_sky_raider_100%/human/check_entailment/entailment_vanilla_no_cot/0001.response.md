### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `a` for each test case.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l`. This is unnecessary because the algorithm does not rely on the order of the prices. The current approach can lead to suboptimal solutions since it always buys tickets from the cheapest day first without considering the impact of future price increases.

3. **Buying Tickets**:
   - The program iterates through each day, determining the number of tickets to buy (`s`) which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets `k`.
   - It calculates the cost of buying these tickets (`s * (l[i] + t)`) and adds this cost to the total cost `c`.
   - It updates the total tickets bought `t` and reduces the remaining tickets `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total cost `c` after processing all days for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The sorting step is unnecessary and can be removed as the algorithm does not require the sorted list to function correctly.
- The logic for buying tickets and updating the cost and remaining tickets is correct and follows the problem constraints.
- The program handles the test cases correctly and outputs the expected results.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples. The sorting step is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:

**True**
