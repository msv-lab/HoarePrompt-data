Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is the loop variable, and its initial value is determined by the input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented within the loop and the loop continues until `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`, the value of `i` must be initialized to 0 (or some value that ensures the loop starts) and the value of `int(input())` must be set to a value that ensures the loop can execute at least once.

Given that `t` is the number of test cases and each test case involves reading values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`, the loop will run `t` times. Therefore, `i` should start from 0 and increment up to `t-1`.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be 0 (initial value before the loop starts).
- `int(input())` should be set to `t` (the number of test cases).

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**.
