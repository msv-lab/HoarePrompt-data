#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list containing two elements, where each element is an input integer; `n` is an input integer.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list containing two elements, where each element is a string of binary digits; `n` is an integer representing the length of the first element in `a`; `s` is a list or string resulting from the loop's conditions; `x` is an integer indicating the position where the loop modified `s`.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 1, `a` is ['010', '110'], `n` is 3, `s` is '010', `x` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs for `x` iterations, which is initially 0. Since the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is never met for `i` in the range of `x` (which is 0), the loop does not execute any iterations. Therefore, `t` remains 1. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: 010
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2` of length `n`. For each test case, it compares parts of the binary strings and constructs a new string `s` based on specific conditions. If a certain pattern is found, it calculates a value `t` indicating the length of a matching segment. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the calculated value `t`.
