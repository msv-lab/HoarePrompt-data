Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 1
- `a` is a list containing the strings '010' and '110'
- `n` is 3
- `s` is the string '010'
- `x` is 0

The code snippet is:
```python
print(t)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `t` is explicitly stated to be 1.
2. The `print(t)` statement will simply print the value of `t`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
