### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic in the provided Python program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure accuracy and completeness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The functions `func_3()` and `func_2()` are used correctly to read the input values `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Possible Value of `m`:**
   - The function iterates backward from `n` to 1, printing queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. This step is crucial to determine the maximum possible value of `m`.
   - The variable `v` is updated to the correct value when a valid `r` is found, ensuring that `m` is maximized.

3. **Splitting Array into Subarrays:**
   - The function attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's `f(l, r)` equals `m`.
   - It uses a nested loop to check if it can split the array into `k` subarrays with the required condition.
   - The inner loop increments `l` until it finds a valid `r` for the current subarray, ensuring that the condition `f(l, r) = m` holds.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where no valid split exists by printing `-1`.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The main issues to verify are:
- Whether the queries are printed correctly and within the constraints.
- Whether the logic for finding the maximum `m` and splitting the array into `k` subarrays is sound.

Since the original assessment correctly identifies these points and the provided code appears to handle them appropriately, the assessment is accurate.
