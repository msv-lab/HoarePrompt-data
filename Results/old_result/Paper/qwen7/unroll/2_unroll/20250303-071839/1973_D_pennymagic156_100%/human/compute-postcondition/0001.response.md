Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, and `v` is 1.**

The variable `v` is initialized to 1. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is that they are positive integers with the condition 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4.
