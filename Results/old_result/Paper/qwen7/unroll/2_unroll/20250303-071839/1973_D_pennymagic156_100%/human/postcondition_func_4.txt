The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers with the constraint \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). It then performs a series of operations involving printing queries and processing responses. If certain conditions are met, it prints a final answer and terminates. Otherwise, it prints `-1` and ends. The function does not return any value.
