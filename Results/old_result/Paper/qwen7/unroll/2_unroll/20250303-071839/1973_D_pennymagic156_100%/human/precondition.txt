This is an interactive problem where the function `readList()` is expected to handle reading the responses from the judge. The judge provides the number of test cases, and for each test case, it provides the length of the hidden array `n` and the number of subarrays `k`. The function must handle making queries to the judge and receiving responses according to the specified rules.
