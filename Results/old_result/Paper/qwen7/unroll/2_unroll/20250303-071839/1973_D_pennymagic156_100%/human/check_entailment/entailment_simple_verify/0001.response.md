### Reasoning

The original assessment is largely accurate, but there are a few points that need clarification and verification through systematic evaluation using the annotated code.

1. **Finding the Maximum Possible Value of `m`:**
   - The code correctly iterates backward from `n` to 1 to find the maximum possible value of `m` by checking `f(1, r) = i * n`.
   - The variable `v` is updated to the appropriate value if `v == n`, which ensures that the maximum possible value of `m` is found.

2. **Splitting Array into Subarrays:**
   - The code uses a nested loop to attempt to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's `f(l, r)` equals `m`.
   - The inner loop increments `l` until it finds a valid `r` for the current subarray, ensuring that the condition `f(l, r) = m` holds.
   - The outer loop ensures that the array is split into `k` subarrays, and the inner loop checks each segment.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The code correctly handles the edge case where no valid split exists by printing `-1`.

However, there are a few potential issues to verify:

- **Query Limit:** The code makes `2n` queries, which is the maximum allowed. We need to ensure that the queries are used efficiently.
- **Correctness of Queries:** The queries are constructed correctly, but we need to ensure that the responses are interpreted correctly.

### Systematic Evaluation Using Annotated Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()`, which is correct.
   - It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward to find the maximum possible value of `m`.

2. **Finding Maximum `m`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1):` correctly checks for the maximum possible value of `m`.
   - The query `print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)` is correct and ensures that the maximum possible value of `m` is found.

3. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The outer loop `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):` correctly attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays.
   - The inner loop `while cnt and l < n + 1:` correctly checks for valid subarrays.
   - The query `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)` is correct and ensures that the condition `f(l, r) = m` is checked.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the inner loop completes without finding a valid subarray, the program prints `-1`, which is correct.

### Verification

Based on the annotated code and the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The queries are constructed and interpreted correctly, and the edge cases are handled appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
