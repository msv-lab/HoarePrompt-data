Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `0` with a step of `-1`, meaning `i` starts at `n` and decrements until it reaches `0`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is initialized correctly.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1 (as given in the problem statement).

5. **Consider the constraints on `k`**: The value of `k` is irrelevant to the loop itself but is mentioned as a constraint. It doesn't affect the initial state needed for the loop to execute.

6. **Initial value of `v`**: The variable `v` is given as 1, which is not relevant to the loop's execution.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment are `n` and `i`. Specifically, `i` should start at `n`, and `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`**.
