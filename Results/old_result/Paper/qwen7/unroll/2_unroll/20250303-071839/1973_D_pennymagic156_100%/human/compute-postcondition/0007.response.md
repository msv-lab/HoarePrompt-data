Output State: **`v` is `n`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, the function `func_2()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_2()` is called, which may contain loops or other operations that could potentially modify the variables. However, since the exact content of `func_2()` is not provided, we can only state that the function has been called and that the values of `v`, `cnt`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. The inner loop's print statement and the outer loop's initialization of `l` to `n + 1` are part of the precondition and are not affected by the call to `func_2()`.
