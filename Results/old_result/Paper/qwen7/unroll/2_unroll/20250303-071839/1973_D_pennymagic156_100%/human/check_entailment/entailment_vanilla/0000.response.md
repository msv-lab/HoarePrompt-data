Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_3()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - The function `func_2()` reads a single integer from the input.
   - The function `func_4()` reads a line of input without splitting it.

2. **Main Function (`func_5`):**
   - The function starts by reading the values of `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes `v` to 1.
   - It iterates backward from `n` to 1, printing queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. This helps in finding the maximum possible value of `m` (which is `i * n`).
   - After determining the maximum possible value of `m`, it attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's `f(l, r)` equals `m`.
   - It uses a nested loop to check if it can split the array into `k` subarrays with the required condition.
   - If it successfully finds such a split, it prints the answer and exits.
   - If it fails to find such a split, it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Check

1. **Finding Maximum Possible Value of `m`:**
   - The code correctly checks for the maximum possible value of `m` by iterating backward from `n` to 1.
   - This ensures that the maximum possible value of `m` is found.

2. **Splitting Array into Subarrays:**
   - The code attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's `f(l, r)` equals `m`.
   - It uses a nested loop to check if it can split the array into `k` subarrays with the required condition.
   - The inner loop increments `l` until it finds a valid `r` for the current subarray, ensuring that the condition `f(l, r) = m` holds.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where no valid split exists by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It finds the maximum possible value of `m` and then attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the required condition. The program handles both the finding of the maximum value and the splitting process correctly.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
