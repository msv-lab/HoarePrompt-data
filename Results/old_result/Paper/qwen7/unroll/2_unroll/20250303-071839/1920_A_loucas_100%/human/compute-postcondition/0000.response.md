Output State: **`loop` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect `t`. The value of `loop` is now an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, based on the user's input.
