Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly identifies the constraints and categorizes them into three lists: `big` (for constraints of type 2), `less` (for constraints of type 1), and `no` (for constraints of type 3).
2. It calculates the potential range of `k` that satisfies both the `big` and `less` constraints, which is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.
3. It then checks for any `no` constraints that fall within this range and subtracts them from the count, ensuring that `k` does not equal these specific values.
4. The logic handles the edge case where the range is invalid (`num < 1`), returning 0 in such cases.
5. The program correctly processes each test case and prints the result for each one.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to be correctly implemented and should produce the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
