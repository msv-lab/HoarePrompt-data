Functionality: **The function processes a series of constraints involving integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each of the \( n \) lines, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( x \), categorizing them into three lists based on the value of \( a \): `big`, `less`, and `no`. It then calculates the difference between the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, adjusting this difference by subtracting the count of elements in `no` that fall within the range defined by `min(less)` and `max(big)`. If this difference is less than 1, the output is 0; otherwise, the adjusted difference is printed. This process is repeated for each of the \( t \) test cases.**
