Output State: The output state depends on the specific values of `loop` and the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. After executing all iterations, `loop` integers will be processed, and for each integer, a value of `num` will be calculated based on the elements in `big`, `less`, and `no`. The final output will be a series of values printed for each iteration, with each value representing `num` for that particular iteration. Each `num` is calculated as the difference between the minimum of `less` and the maximum of `big`, adjusted by the number of elements in `no` that fall within the range defined by `min(less)` and `max(big)`, ensuring this difference is at least 1. If the difference is less than 1, the output is 0.
