### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through values of \(b\) from 2 to the minimum of \(n\) and \(m\), and for each \(b\), it adds \(\frac{n + b}{b \cdot b}\) to the answer. This approach does not correctly implement the required conditions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula \(\frac{n + b}{b \cdot b}\) does not reflect the conditions specified in the problem. It does not account for the gcd condition or the requirement that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **No GCD Calculation**: The program does not compute the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) for each pair.
3. **No Multiple Check**: The program does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's consider the example given in the problem statement:
- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct pairs should be checked against the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here are some correct pairs for \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
- \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\), and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\), and \(3\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\), and \(4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).
- \((3, 1)\): \(3 + 1 = 4\), and \(4\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\).
- \((4, 1)\): \(4 + 1 = 5\), and \(5\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1) = 1\).
- \((5, 1)\): \(5 + 1 = 6\), and \(6\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1) = 1\).
- \((6, 1)\): \(6 + 1 = 7\), and \(7\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(6, 1) = 1\).
- \((6, 2)\): \(6 + 2 = 8\), and \(8\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(6, 2) = 2\).
- \((6, 3)\): \(6 + 3 = 9\), and \(9\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3\).
- \((7, 1)\): \(7 + 1 = 8\), and \(8\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1) = 1\).
- \((8, 1)\): \(8 + 1 = 9\), and \(9\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(8, 1) = 1\).
- \((9, 1)\): \(9 + 1 = 10\), and \(10\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1) = 1\).
- \((10, 1)\): \(10 + 1 = 11\), and \(11\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(10, 1) = 1\).
- \((10, 2)\): \(10 + 2 = 12\), and \(12\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(10, 2) = 2\).

The program fails to correctly identify these pairs and instead uses a different and incorrect formula.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
