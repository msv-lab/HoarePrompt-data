### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` as strings, converts them to integers, and initializes `ans` to `n`.
- It then iterates over `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, and for each `b`, it updates `ans` by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\).
- Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It correctly converts `n` and `m` from strings to integers.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is the count of pairs where \(a = n\) and \(b\) can be any value from 1 to \(m\). This part is correct.
   - However, the loop over `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m` and the update of `ans` using \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is incorrect. This formula does not reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - Specifically, the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). It simply adds a value to `ans` without considering the gcd condition or the multiple condition.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\).
   - The program will iterate over `b` from 2 to 8 and add \((10 + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.
   - For example, when \(b = 2\), \((10 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 12 // 4 = 3\). This value is added to `ans`, but it does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation does not perform this check and instead uses a simplified formula that does not satisfy the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
