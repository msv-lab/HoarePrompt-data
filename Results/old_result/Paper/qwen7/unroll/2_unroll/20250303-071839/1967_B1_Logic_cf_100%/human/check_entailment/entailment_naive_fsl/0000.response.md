Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` using a formula that does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement. 

To illustrate, consider the test case `n = 10` and `m = 8`. According to the problem description, we need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 \le a \le n`, `1 \le b \le m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.

However, the program's logic does not properly check these conditions. Instead, it incorrectly adds a value to `ans` based on a simplified formula `(n + b) // (b * b)`, which does not account for the gcd condition or the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.

For instance, for the pair `(2, 2)`, the program would incorrectly include this pair in the count, as it does not validate whether `2 + 2` is a multiple of `2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2)`. This is because the program does not explicitly compute the gcd or check the multiple condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
