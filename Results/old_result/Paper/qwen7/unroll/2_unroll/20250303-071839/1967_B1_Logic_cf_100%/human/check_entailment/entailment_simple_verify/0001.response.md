### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Logic:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is not relevant to the problem's condition.
   - The loop iterates over values of `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, but the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Missing Key Steps:**
   - The program does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) for each \(b\) and check the condition.
   - There is no calculation of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and no verification that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case \( (n, m) = (10, 8) \):
     - The expected output is 14.
     - The program calculates `ans` as `n` (which is 10) and then adds some values based on the incorrect logic, which does not match the expected output.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
