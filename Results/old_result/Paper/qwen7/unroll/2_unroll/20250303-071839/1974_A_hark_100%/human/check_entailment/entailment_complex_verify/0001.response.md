### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to place 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells total per screen).
- We need to minimize the number of screens required.
- For 2x2 icons, we can place 4 icons per screen.
- For 1x1 icons, we can place 1 icon per cell.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not called. This is indeed a potential issue, but let's assume the function is called elsewhere and focus on the logic within the function.
   - The main logic starts with `ap = int(input())`, which reads the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs `ap` times, processing each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`) are read using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - Different conditions handle different scenarios:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, a specific calculation is performed.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0, the number of screens needed is calculated directly.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0, the number of screens needed is calculated directly.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, 0 screens are needed.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid.
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the remaining number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The total number of screens is then `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

#### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
   - `x = 1 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10` (This should be 1 - 4 = -3, but the logic seems off)
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if -3 <= 0 else math.ceil(-3 / 15) = 0`
   - Total screens = `0 + 1 = 1`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
   - `x = 7 - 1 * 15 + 2 * 4 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0`
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if 0 <= 0 else math.ceil(0 / 15) = 0`
   - Total screens = `0 + 1 = 1`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `x = 12`, `y = 4`
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`
   - `x = 12 - 2 * 15 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2`
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if -2 <= 0 else math.ceil(-2 / 15) = 0`
   - Total screens = `0 + 2 = 2`

The logic in the program is incorrect because:
- The adjustment for the remaining 1x1 icons (`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`) is flawed. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4 + y * 4` instead.
- The calculation for `bxsfory1` should be based on the remaining 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, not the adjusted `x`.

#### Corrected Logic
- Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit: `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`
- Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons: `remaining_x = x - bxsfory * 4`
- Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(remaining_x / 15)`
- Total screens: `total_screens = bxsfory + bxsfory1`

#### Conclusion
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaws in the logic. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
