You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i). For each test case, the function calculates the count of beautiful pairs `(num, a_i)` where `num` can be transformed into `a_i` by performing a series of operations consisting of either adding `x` or subtracting `y` modulo `x` and `y`. It then appends these counts to a list `results`. Finally, the function returns the list `results` containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing test case parameters).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the dictionary.
   - It also extracts the array `a`.
   - It prints the parameters and the array for debugging purposes.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Initialization:**
   - A dictionary `freq` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`:
     - Calculate `mod_x` and `mod_y` using `num % x` and `num % y`.
     - Calculate the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` values that would make the pair beautiful.
     - Check if the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, add the corresponding frequency to `beautiful_count`.
     - Update the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

5. **Appending Results:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, append the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

6. **Returning Results:**
   - Finally, return the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Modulo Calculations:**
   - The modulo calculations are correct and necessary to determine if a pair is beautiful.

2. **Frequency Dictionary Usage:**
   - The frequency dictionary is used correctly to count the occurrences of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair, which helps in identifying the beautiful pairs efficiently.

3. **Pair Validation:**
   - The logic for validating the beautiful pairs is correct. It checks if the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when a number itself forms a beautiful pair with another number (e.g., `a_i + a_j` and `a_i - a_j` both being zero).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic for determining and counting beautiful pairs is correct. The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the required operations correctly.
