Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i). For each test case, the function calculates the count of beautiful pairs `(num, a_i)` where `num` can be transformed into `a_i` by performing a series of operations consisting of either adding `x` or subtracting `y` modulo `x` and `y`. It then appends these counts to a list `results`. Finally, the function returns the list `results` containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.**
