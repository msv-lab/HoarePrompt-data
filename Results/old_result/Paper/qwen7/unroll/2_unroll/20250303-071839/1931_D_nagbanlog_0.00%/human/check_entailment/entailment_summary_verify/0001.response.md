### Reasoning

The original assessment provided a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and concluded that the program is correct. However, let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure there are no hidden issues or logical flaws.

1. **Function Definition and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing test case parameters).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the dictionary.
   - It also extracts the array `a`.
   - It prints the parameters and the array for debugging purposes.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Initialization:**
   - A dictionary `freq` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`:
     - Calculate `mod_x` and `mod_y` using `num % x` and `num % y`.
     - Calculate the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` values that would make the pair beautiful.
     - Check if the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, add the corresponding frequency to `beautiful_count`.
     - Update the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

5. **Appending Results:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, append the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

6. **Returning Results:**
   - Finally, return the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Modulo Calculations
- The modulo calculations are correct and necessary to determine if a pair is beautiful. This ensures that we are checking the conditions \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).

#### Frequency Dictionary Usage
- The frequency dictionary is used correctly to count the occurrences of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair, which helps in identifying the beautiful pairs efficiently. This approach ensures that we do not double-count pairs and handle the problem in linear time relative to the number of elements in the array.

#### Pair Validation
- The logic for validating the beautiful pairs is correct. It checks if the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary. This ensures that we are correctly identifying pairs that satisfy the conditions.

#### Edge Cases
- The program handles edge cases such as when a number itself forms a beautiful pair with another number (e.g., `a_i + a_j` and `a_i - a_j` both being zero). This is correctly handled by the modulo operations and the frequency dictionary.

### Potential Issues
- One potential issue could be related to the way the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pairs are calculated. Specifically, the calculation of `required_mod_x` should be adjusted to avoid negative values. Instead of `(x - mod_x) % x`, it should be `((x - mod_x) + x) % x` to ensure non-negative values.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = ((x - mod_x) + x) % x  # Ensure non-negative value
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}')
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation

After the detailed analysis and the potential correction, the program appears to be correct. The original assessment was accurate, and the provided code handles the problem correctly.

Final: **True**
