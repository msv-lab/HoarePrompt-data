Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. The main issues are:

1. **Modulo Calculation Mismatch**: The program calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` incorrectly. For `required_mod_x`, it should be `(x - (num % x)) % x`, but it should also handle the case where `num % x == 0`. Similarly, for `required_mod_y`, it should be `(y - (num % y)) % y`.

2. **Logic for Finding Beautiful Pairs**: The logic to find beautiful pairs is flawed. It checks if the required mods exist in the frequency dictionary but does not correctly account for the conditions \(a_i + a_j\) being divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) being divisible by \(y\).

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        # Calculate the mods for each element in the array
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = (y - mod_y) % y
            
            # Check if there are elements with the required mods
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]
            
            # Update the frequency dictionary
            if (mod_x, mod_y) in freq:
                freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] += 1
            else:
                freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] = 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    
    return results
```

This corrected version ensures that the modulo calculations are done correctly and the logic for finding beautiful pairs is properly implemented.
