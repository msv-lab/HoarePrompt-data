The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer n (size of the array, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it finds and prints the maximum value of the minimum adjacent elements in the array a.
