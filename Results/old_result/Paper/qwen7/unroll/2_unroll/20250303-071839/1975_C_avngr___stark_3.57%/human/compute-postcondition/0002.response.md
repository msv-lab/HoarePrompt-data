Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each i from 1 to t-1, n_i is the number of elements in the list a_i, where a_i is a list of integers. max_i is the maximum value among min(a_i[j], a_i[j-1]) for all j from 1 to n_i-1. The value of max_i is printed for each i from 1 to t-1.
