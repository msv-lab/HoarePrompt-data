Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements for all cases. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Constraints and Requirements**:
   - The solution constructs a list `ans` with specific values, but it does not guarantee that every integer from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) has a subsequence sum equal to itself.
   - The constructed list `ans` may not cover all required sums from 1 to `n` excluding `k`.

2. **Specific Example Analysis**:
   - For the test case `8 8`, the expected output is a sequence where subsequences can sum to all numbers from 1 to 7, but the provided solution might not achieve this.
   - The constructed sequence `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by powers of 2 does not ensure that every number from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as a subsequence sum.

3. **General Approach**:
   - A more robust approach would involve constructing a sequence that includes all necessary sums directly. One possible method is to use a combination of small numbers to cover all sums from 1 to `n` excluding `k`.

### Correct Solution Approach:
A correct solution could involve generating a sequence that includes all numbers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) directly. Hereâ€™s an example of how you could implement this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        ans = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i != k:
                ans.append(i)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)

func()
```

This solution ensures that every number from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) is included in the sequence, thus satisfying the problem requirements.
