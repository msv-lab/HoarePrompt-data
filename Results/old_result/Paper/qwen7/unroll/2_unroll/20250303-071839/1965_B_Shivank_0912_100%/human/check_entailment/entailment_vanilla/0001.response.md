Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers.
- No subsequence of \(a\) should have a sum equal to \(k\).
- For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there should be a subsequence of \(a\) with a sum of \(v\).

### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The program calculates an integer `i` such that \(1 << (i+1) > k\). This ensures that \(1 << i < k \le 1 << (i+1)\).
   - It initializes the answer list `ans` with three values:
     - \(k - (1 << i)\)
     - \(k + 1\)
     - \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\)
   - It then appends powers of 2 (from \(1 << 0\) to \(1 << 19\)) to the list `ans`, skipping the power of 2 corresponding to `i`.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` is printed.

### Verification:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to \(k\):**
   - The sequence includes \(k - (1 << i)\) and \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\), which means no combination of these values can sum to \(k\). This is because any sum involving \(k - (1 << i)\) will be less than \(k\), and any sum involving \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\) will be greater than \(k\).

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to \(n\) Except \(k\):**
   - The sequence includes \(k + 1\), which can form subsequences summing to any value from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\). By including powers of 2, the program can form any sum from 1 to \(n - 1\) using these values.

3. **Sequence Length:**
   - The sequence length is determined by the number of elements added, which is 23 (three fixed values plus 20 powers of 2). This is well within the limit of 25.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly generates a sequence that meets all the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
