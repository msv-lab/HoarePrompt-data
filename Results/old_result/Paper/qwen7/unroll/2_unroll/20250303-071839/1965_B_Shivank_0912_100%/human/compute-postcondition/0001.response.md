Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for tc in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `tc` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `tc` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `tc < t`. Therefore, the loop will run exactly `t` times.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `t` is already defined and its value is known (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), we don't need to change its value.
   - The variable `tc` starts at 0 and will increment during each iteration. For the loop to start executing, `tc` should be set to 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `tc` should be 0.
- `t` remains as the input value, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
