Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) are processed. The function returns a result based on the conditions given for `n` and `k` for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, and `k`. For each set of `n` and `k`, the function determines a specific outcome based on their values, and this outcome is returned for each test case. The overall constraint ensures that the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
