The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as inputs and generates a list containing specific powers of 2 related to `k`. The list includes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, the next power of 2 greater than `k`, and all powers of 2 from 1 up to but not exceeding the largest power of 2 less than `k`. It then prints the length of this list followed by the list itself for each test case.
