Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is incremented by `a`, `y1` is adjusted to `y2 - (y2 - 1)`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` reduced by `a`, `y2` is 1, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1` since `y1` ≥ `y2`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, `y1` is now `0`.**

Explanation: 
- `y1` is decremented by `a`, which is `y2 - 1` since `y1` ≥ `y2`. Given `y2` is 1, `a` is `1 - 1 = 0`, but since `y1` ≥ `y2`, `a` is actually `1`. So, `y1` becomes `y1 - 1`.
- Since `y1` was initially the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, and given `y2` is 1, `y1` must have been 1 before the operation. After decrementing by `1`, `y1` becomes `0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as they were not directly affected by the operation.
