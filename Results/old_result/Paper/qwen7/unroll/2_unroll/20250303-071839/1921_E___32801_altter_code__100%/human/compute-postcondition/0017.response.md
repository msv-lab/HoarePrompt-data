Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is incremented by 1, and y1 is adjusted based on the relationship with y2 (if y2 > y1, y1 becomes one more than the original value; otherwise, y1 becomes one less than the original value). x2 is the fifth element of r, and y2 is the sixth element of r, with x2 being greater than x1.**
