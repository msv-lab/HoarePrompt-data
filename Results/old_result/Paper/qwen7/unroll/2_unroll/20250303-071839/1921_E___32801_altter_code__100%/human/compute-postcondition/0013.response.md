Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is increased by 1, y1 is one more than the original y1 (which was not equal to y2 and y2 was greater than y1), x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, x2 is greater than x1.**

In this output state, the variable `x1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
