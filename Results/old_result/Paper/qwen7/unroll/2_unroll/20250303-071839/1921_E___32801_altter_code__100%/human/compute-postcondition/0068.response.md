Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`. The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`**.
