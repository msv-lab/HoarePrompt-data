Functionality: **The function processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a line of input, splits it into elements, and calculates the sum of counts of each unique element in the line, dividing this sum by 3. This calculation is performed for every second line starting from the third line of input. The function outputs these calculated values for each relevant line of input. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but the output consists of the calculated sums for each test case.**
