Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. However, the provided program simply counts the occurrences of each unique element in the input and divides by 3, which is not related to the game logic described.

To illustrate, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For the input `1 1 2 3`, the program would output `1` because there are three unique elements (1, 2, 3), and `3 // 3 = 1`. This is incorrect because, as explained in the example, the correct output should be `1`.

2. For the input `7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`, the program would output `2` because there are eight unique elements (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8), and `8 // 3 = 2`. This is also incorrect because the correct output should be `2`.

The program fails to account for the optimal strategy for selecting cards and the interaction between you and Nene. Specifically, it does not consider Nene's strategy of maximizing her score while minimizing yours, nor does it simulate the game turns correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
