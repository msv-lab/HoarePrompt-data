Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over a specified number of times (determined by `n`). It is typically not used within the loop body, but its presence in the loop header indicates that the loop will run `n` times.
   - `n`: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the value of `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop head only involves the variable `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\)
- `day` is 'AM'
- `n` is an input integer

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, day is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**
