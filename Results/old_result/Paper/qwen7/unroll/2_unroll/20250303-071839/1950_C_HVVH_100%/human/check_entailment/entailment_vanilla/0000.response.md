Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `day` is initialized to `'AM'`.
   - `n` is set to the number of test cases, read from the input.
   
2. **Loop through Test Cases**:
   - The program iterates `n` times, reading a time in 24-hour format (`hh:mm`) for each test case.
   
3. **Extracting Hours and Minutes**:
   - For each test case, the time string is split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), both converted to integers.
   
4. **Determining AM/PM**:
   - If `h` is 0, it is adjusted to 12 and `day` remains `'AM'`.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to `'PM'`.
   - Otherwise, `day` is set to `'AM'`. There is an additional check if `h` is 12, which incorrectly sets `day` to `'PM'`.

5. **Printing the Time**:
   - The formatted time in 12-hour format along with the determined AM/PM is printed.

### Issues Identified:

- **Incorrect Handling of Hour 12**:
  - When `h` is 12, the code incorrectly sets `day` to `'PM'`. This is incorrect because 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM, but 12:00 AM would be midnight in 12-hour format.
  - The correct logic should be:
    - If `h` is 12, `day` should be `'PM'`.
    - If `h` is less than 12, `day` should be `'AM'`.

### Corrected Code:

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
        day = 'PM' if h == 12 else 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error in handling the hour 12. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
