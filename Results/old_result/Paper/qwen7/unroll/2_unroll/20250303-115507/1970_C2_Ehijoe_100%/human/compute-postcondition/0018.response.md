Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `t` (an integer equal to 1 representing the number of rounds), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the first round). It returns information about the structure and starting point of the tree based on these parameters.**
