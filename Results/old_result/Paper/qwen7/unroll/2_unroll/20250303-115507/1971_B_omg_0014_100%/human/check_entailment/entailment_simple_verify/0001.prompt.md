You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration of the loop with input string `s`, if the length of the set `a` is 1 (meaning all characters in `s` are the same), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', sorts the string `s` in both ascending and descending order, and prints the sorted string based on the original string's order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Single Character Check**: For each test case, the program checks if the string `s` consists of a single unique character by converting it into a set (`a = set(s)`). If the set has only one element, it prints "NO" because there are no other distinct characters to rearrange.
3. **Multiple Characters Check**: If the set has more than one element, the program prints "YES".
4. **Generating Rearranged Strings**: 
   - The program generates two rearrangements of the string `s`: 
     - One sorted in ascending order (`b = ''.join(sorted(s))`).
     - One sorted in descending order (`c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`).
5. **Ensuring Distinctness**: 
   - If the sorted string in ascending order (`b`) is the same as the original string `s`, it prints the sorted string in descending order (`c`).
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string in ascending order (`b`).

However, the problem statement requires that the generated string `r` should be different from the original string `s`. The current logic does not guarantee this condition. Specifically, if the string `s` is already sorted in either ascending or descending order, the generated string will be the same as `s`.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case "codeforces"**: 
  - Sorted in ascending order: `cdeforstcdeo`
  - Sorted in descending order: `ostcdrefcso`
  - The program outputs `forcodesec`, which is a valid rearrangement.
- **Test Case "aaaaa"**: 
  - Since all characters are the same, the program correctly outputs "NO".
- **Test Case "co"**: 
  - Sorted in ascending order: `co`
  - Sorted in descending order: `oc`
  - The program outputs `oc`, which is a valid rearrangement.
- **Test Case "d"**: 
  - Since the string has only one character, the program correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program does not always ensure that the generated string `r` is different from `s`. For strings like "aaa" or "zzz", the program would output the same string, violating the requirement.

### Correctness:
**False**

Correctness: **False**
