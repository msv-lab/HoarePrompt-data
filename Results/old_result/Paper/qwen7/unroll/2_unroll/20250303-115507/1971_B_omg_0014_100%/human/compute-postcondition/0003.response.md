Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration of the loop with input string `s`, if the length of the set `a` is 1 (meaning all characters in `s` are the same), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', sorts the string `s` in both ascending and descending order, and prints the sorted string based on the original string's order.
