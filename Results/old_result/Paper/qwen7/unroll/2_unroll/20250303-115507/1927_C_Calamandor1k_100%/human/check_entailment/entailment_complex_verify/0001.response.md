### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, array `a`, and array `b`.

2. **Creating Sets:**
   - For each test case, it creates sets of unique elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - This step is correct and ensures that we only consider elements within the range `[1, k]`.

3. **Calculating Exclusive and Common Elements:**
   - It then calculates the number of elements that are exclusive to `a` (`only_a`), exclusive to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
   - These calculations are correct and ensure that we have a clear understanding of the distribution of elements within the range `[1, k]`.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the number of elements exclusive to `a` or `b` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it immediately appends 'NO' to the results and moves to the next test case.
   - This condition is necessary because if more than `k // 2` elements are exclusive to one array, it is impossible to satisfy the requirement of having `k // 2` elements from each array.

5. **Total Distinct Elements Check:**
   - It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is at least `k`. If not, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - This condition ensures that there are enough distinct elements to cover all numbers from `1` to `k`.

6. **Appending Results:**
   - If neither of the above conditions fail, it appends 'YES' to the results.
   - This step is correct and ensures that if all conditions are met, the result is 'YES'.

7. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and returns the results in a list.
   - The logic in the program correctly follows the problem statement and ensures that all numbers from `1` to `k` can be included among the chosen elements from both arrays.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It ensures that the conditions for selecting elements from both arrays are met, and it handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
