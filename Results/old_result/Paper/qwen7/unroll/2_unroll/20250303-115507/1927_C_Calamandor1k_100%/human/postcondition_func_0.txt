The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `cases`, a list of tuples containing integers `n`, `m`, and `k` under specific constraints. It processes each tuple to determine whether certain conditions involving sets derived from lists `a` and `b` are met. If the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds `k // 2`, or the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than `k`, it appends 'NO' to the results list. Otherwise, it appends 'YES'. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
