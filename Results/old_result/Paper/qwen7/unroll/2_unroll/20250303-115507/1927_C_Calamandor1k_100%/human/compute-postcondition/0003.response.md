Output State: `results` is a list that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. If for any test case, the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds `k // 2`, or the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than `k`, then 'NO' is appended to the list. Otherwise, 'YES' is appended.
