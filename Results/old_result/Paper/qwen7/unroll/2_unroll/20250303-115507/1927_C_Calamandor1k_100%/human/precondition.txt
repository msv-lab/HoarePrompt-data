t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), k is even), followed by two lines containing n and m integers respectively (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6). The sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
