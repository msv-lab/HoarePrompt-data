### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, array `a`, and array `b`.

2. **Creating Sets of Relevant Elements:**
   - For each test case, it creates sets of unique elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - This step is crucial as it filters out elements that are not relevant to the problem (i.e., those greater than `k`).

3. **Calculating Exclusive and Common Elements:**
   - It then calculates the number of elements that are exclusive to `a` (`only_a`), exclusive to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
   - These calculations help in determining how many elements can be chosen from each array without violating the constraints.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the number of elements exclusive to `a` or `b` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it immediately appends 'NO' to the results and moves to the next test case.
   - This condition ensures that no more than half of the required elements can come from one array alone.
   - It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is at least `k`. If not, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - This condition ensures that there are enough unique elements to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.

5. **Appending Results:**
   - If neither of the above conditions fail, it appends 'YES' to the results.
   - This ensures that the program correctly identifies whether it is possible to choose the required elements.

6. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and returns the results in a list.
   - The logic in the program correctly follows the problem statement and ensures that all numbers from 1 to `k` can be included among the chosen elements from both arrays.

### Evaluation:

- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program follows the problem statement and ensures that the conditions are met.
- The program handles edge cases appropriately by checking the number of exclusive and common elements and ensuring the total count meets the requirement.
- The logic is sound and the program correctly outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description.
