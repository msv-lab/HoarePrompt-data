Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - The solution uses a bitwise XOR operation with `check = 2 ** 31 - 1` (which is `111...111` in binary, a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1).
   - For each number `i` in the list, it calculates `s = i ^ check`. This operation flips all the bits of `i`.
   - If `s` is already in the dictionary `dic`, it means there's another number in the current group that has the same flipped bits, so we decrement the count in `dic` and reduce the answer `ans` by 1.
   - If `i` itself is in the dictionary, it means there's another number in the current group that has the same bits, so we increment the count in `dic`.
   - Otherwise, we add `i` to the dictionary with a count of 1.

3. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates `times` times, and for each test case, it processes `n` numbers.
   - The `check` variable is reset to `2 ** 31 - 1` at the beginning of each test case, but this does not affect the logic inside the inner loop.
   - The `times` variable is decremented by 1 after each test case, eventually reaching 0.

4. **Output Analysis**:
   - The program prints `ans` after processing each number in the current test case.
   - The final state of `check` and `times` is as described in the comment, but these variables do not affect the correctness of the logic for calculating the minimum number of groups.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly identifies pairs of numbers that share the same bits and reduces the count of required groups accordingly.
   - The program prints the correct number of groups for each test case.

Given the analysis, the program logic is correct and follows the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
