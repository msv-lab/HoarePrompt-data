Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and all other variables are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `times = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `times`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` is now stored in `times`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
