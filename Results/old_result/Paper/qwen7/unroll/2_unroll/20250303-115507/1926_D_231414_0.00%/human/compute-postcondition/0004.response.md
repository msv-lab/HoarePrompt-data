Output State: `check` is 2147483647, `times` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs `times` number of times, and each iteration updates the `check` variable to `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is 2147483647. After all iterations, `times` will be reduced to 0 because it decreases by 1 in each iteration. The `check` variable remains unchanged as it is reset to 2147483647 at the start of each iteration.
