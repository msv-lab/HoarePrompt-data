Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads the input for multiple test cases. It correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of coins (`n`) and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins. It stores these details in a list of tuples, which is returned.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function takes a single test case (a tuple containing `n` and `s`) and calculates the number of facing-up coins (`ups`). If the count of facing-up coins is even, it returns "YES" indicating that Alice will win; otherwise, it returns "NO".

Given the problem statement and the examples, this implementation correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
