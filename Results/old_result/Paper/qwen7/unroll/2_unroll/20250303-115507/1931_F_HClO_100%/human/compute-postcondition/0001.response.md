State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `_` is irrelevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` and the dummy variable `_`.
- The value of `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is mentioned that `t` is a positive integer, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed a positive integer.
- The dummy variable `_` is used for iteration and does not affect the loop's execution condition. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `_`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is a positive integer.
