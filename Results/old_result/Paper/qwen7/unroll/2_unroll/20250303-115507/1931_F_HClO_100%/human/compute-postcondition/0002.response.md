Output State: **All variables except `t` remain unchanged, and `t` is set to the number of iterations specified by the user. The final state of `l1` or `l2` depends on the conditions inside the loop, but it will be one of the lists that satisfies all the conditions or remains unchanged if no valid list can be formed.**
