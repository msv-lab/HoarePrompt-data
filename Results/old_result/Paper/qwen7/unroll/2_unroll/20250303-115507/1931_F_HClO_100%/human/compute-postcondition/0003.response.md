Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and k, and a list of n distinct integers ranging from 1 to n. For each test case, it checks if the conditions 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and n ⋅ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 are met. It then returns information based on these integers and the list provided, though the specific return value is not detailed in the given information.**
