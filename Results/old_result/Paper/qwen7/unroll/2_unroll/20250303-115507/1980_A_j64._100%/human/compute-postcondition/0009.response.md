Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (an integer between 1 and 50), m (an integer between 1 and 5), and a (a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It counts the occurrences of each character in the string a and calculates how many additional problems are needed so that each character type has at least m occurrences. Regardless of the input, the function always returns 7.**
