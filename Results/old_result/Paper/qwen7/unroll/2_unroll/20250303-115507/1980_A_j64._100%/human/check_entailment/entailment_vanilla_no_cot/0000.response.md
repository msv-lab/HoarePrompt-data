Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string and calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure that there are at least `m` problems for each difficulty level across all rounds. The function `func_1` performs this calculation accurately, and the main loop processes each test case appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description.
