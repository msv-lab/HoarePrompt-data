#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: count is [cA, cB, cC, cD, cE, cF, cG]
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: Output State: count is [cA, cB, cC, cD, cE, cF, cG], needed_problems is 7
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates 7 times (from 0 to 6). During each iteration, it checks if `count[i]` is less than `m`. If true, it adds `m - count[i]` to `needed_problems`. Since the initial values of `count` are `[cA, cB, cC, cD, cE, cF, cG]` and `m` is not specified, we assume `m` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `count` initially. Therefore, for each iteration, `count[i]` will always be less than `m`, and `needed_problems` will increase by `m - count[i]` for each `i` from 0 to 6. This results in `needed_problems` being incremented by 7, as there are 7 iterations in total.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns 7
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: n (an integer between 1 and 50), m (an integer between 1 and 5), and a (a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It counts the occurrences of each character in the string a and calculates how many additional problems are needed so that each character type has at least m occurrences. Regardless of the input, the function always returns 7.
