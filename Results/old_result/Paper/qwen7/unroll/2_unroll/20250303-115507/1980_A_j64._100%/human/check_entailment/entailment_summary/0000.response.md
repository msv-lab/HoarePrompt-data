Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each of the seven difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times across `m` rounds. However, the current implementation always returns 7, which is incorrect.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to zero.
- It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position in the alphabet ('A' to 'G').
- After counting the occurrences of each difficulty level, it calculates the total number of additional problems needed by checking how many more problems are required for each level to reach `m` occurrences.
- However, the function always returns the value of `needed_problems`, which is calculated based on the difference between `m` and the current count for each level, but it does not properly account for the fact that the total number of additional problems needed should be the sum of the differences for all levels that fall short of `m`.

Given the execution summary, the function always returns 7, indicating that it does not correctly compute the required values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
