You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: results is a list of 'no' and 'yes' based on the conditions given in the loop. For each iteration, if `n` is even, 'no' is appended; otherwise, if the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended; otherwise, 'no' is appended.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the initial list `results` and the conditions specified in the loop. Since no specific `results` list or `arr` string is provided, we cannot determine the exact output. However, the loop will print each element of the `results` list as it is, without modifying it.
    #
    #If we assume an example where `results = ['no', 'yes', 'no']` and `arr` is a string like "UUDD", then the loop would print:
    #
    #```
    #no
    #yes
    #no
    #```
    #
    #Output State: ['no', 'yes', 'no'].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (length of a string), and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is even or if the number of "U"s in \( s \) is greater than the number of "D"s. If \( n \) is even, it appends "no" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "yes" or "no" based on the comparison of "U"s and "D"s. Finally, it prints each element of the results list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game rules. Specifically, the program only checks the count of 'U' and 'D' in the string and makes a decision based on that. However, the game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins, which is not accounted for in the current implementation.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
5
UUDUD
5
UDDUD
2
UU
```

- In the first test case (`UUDUD`), the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it only counts the number of 'U' and 'D'. According to the game rules, Alice can remove the first coin ('U'), flip the adjacent coins ('D' and 'D'), resulting in "DDUU". Then Bob can remove the last coin ('U'), leaving "DD". Alice can then remove the first coin ('D'), leaving the second coin ('D'). Since there's only one coin left, the game ends, and Alice wins. Therefore, the program should output "YES".

- In the second test case (`UDDUD`), the program also incorrectly outputs "NO" for the same reason. Alice can remove the first coin ('U'), flip the adjacent coins ('D' and 'D'), resulting in "DDDU". Then Bob can remove the last coin ('U'), leaving "DDD". Alice can then remove the first coin ('D'), leaving "DD". Since there's only one coin left, the game ends, and Alice wins. Therefore, the program should output "YES".

- In the third test case (`UU`), the program correctly outputs "NO" because after Alice removes the first coin ('U'), the second coin ('U') is flipped, leaving no coins for Bob to remove. Therefore, Alice wins, and the program correctly outputs "NO".

Thus, the program does not correctly simulate the game rules and fails to handle the game logic properly.
