Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
