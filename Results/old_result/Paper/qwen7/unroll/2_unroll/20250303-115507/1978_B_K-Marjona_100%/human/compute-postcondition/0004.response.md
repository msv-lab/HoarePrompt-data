Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). For each test case, it calculates the total revenue generated from selling all buns based on the following rules: if the modified price (b) is greater than the usual price (a), it applies a discount to the first few buns and charges the usual price for the rest; otherwise, it charges the usual price for all buns. The function outputs the total revenue for each test case.**
