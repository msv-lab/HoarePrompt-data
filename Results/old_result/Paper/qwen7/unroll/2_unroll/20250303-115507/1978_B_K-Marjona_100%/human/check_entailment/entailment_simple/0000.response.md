Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the specified promotion rules.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit for each test case.
3. The program iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
4. It calculates the value of `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between the special price and the usual price.
5. If `b <= a`, it means there is no benefit from the promotion, so the program simply prints `a * n` as the profit.
6. Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This formula accounts for the reduced price of the first `k` buns and the usual price of the remaining buns.
7. The program correctly handles all given examples and edge cases as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
