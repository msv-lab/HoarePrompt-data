Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12 in the 24-hour format. According to the problem description, when the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format, it should be represented as "12:xx PM" in the 12-hour format. However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when the hour is 12, regardless of whether it is the start of the PM half of the day or not. For example, if the input is "12:00", the program will output "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM".

To fix this, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' should be changed to check if the hour is 12 and if it's not the start of the day (i.e., it's not 00:00). Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


func()
```

However, a more robust solution would be:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


func()
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all edge cases, including when the hour is 12.
