Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight and Noon:**
   - The program incorrectly handles `00:00` and `12:00`. It should print `12:00 AM` and `12:00 PM` respectively, but it prints `12:00 AM` for both.
   
2. **Incorrect Splitting of Input:**
   - The program uses `input().split(':')`, which does not correctly split the input string when the hours are single digits. For example, `09:41` would be split into `['0', '9:41']` instead of `['09', '41']`.

3. **Day Assignment Logic:**
   - The logic for assigning `day` is flawed. It should be `day = 'PM'` if `h >= 12` and `day = 'AM'` otherwise. The current logic is not correctly handling the transition between AM and PM.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')

func()
```

This corrected version should handle all edge cases correctly and produce the expected output.
