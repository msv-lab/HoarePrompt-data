Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. `n` is the number of children, `m` is the number of pairs of friends, `k` is the number of excursions, and `friendships` is a list of tuples containing the indices of pairs of children who are friends and their friendship values. The function returns the sum of the friendship values for all pairs of friends multiplied by the combination of `k` taken 2 at a time, all modulo `MOD`.**
