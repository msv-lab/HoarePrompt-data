Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer representing the number of children, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions, and `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers [a_i, b_i, f_i] representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `friendships` remain unchanged from the initial state.
