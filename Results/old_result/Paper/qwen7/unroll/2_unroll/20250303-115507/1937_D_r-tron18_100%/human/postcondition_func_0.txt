The function accepts a list of integers `arr` representing the positions of the pinball on a grid over time and an integer `times` representing the initial cell index. It calculates and returns the difference between the last position of the pinball in the list and the position of the pinball at an index determined by `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
