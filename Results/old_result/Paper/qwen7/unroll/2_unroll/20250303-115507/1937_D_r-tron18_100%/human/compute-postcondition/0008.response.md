To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **`totalOne`**: Given as 0.
2. **`s1`**: A string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
3. **`pre`**: An empty list.
4. **`preOne`**: An empty list.
5. **`suffZero`**: A list of length `n+1` where each element is the cumulative sum of indices from `s1` in reverse order starting from 0. This means `suffZero[i] = (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + i`.
6. **`ans`**: A list of `n` integers calculated based on the conditions within the loop.

Given the initial state, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the contents of the `ans` list. Since the exact values of `s1` and the conditions used to calculate `ans` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `ans`. However, we know the structure and the way `ans` is populated based on the conditions in the loop.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the `ans` list, which are determined by the conditions in the loop but whose exact values are not specified in the initial state.

Output: **the elements of the list ans (where ans is a list of n integers calculated based on the conditions within the loop)**
