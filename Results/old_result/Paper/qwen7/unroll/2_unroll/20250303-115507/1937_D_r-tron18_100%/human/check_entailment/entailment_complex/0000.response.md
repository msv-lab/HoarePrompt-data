Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a grid of length \( n \) with characters '<' and '>' indicating the direction the pinball should move. The pinball's movement is influenced by the direction indicated by the character in its current cell, and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function computes the difference between the last position of the pinball and a specific position determined by the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - While the logic seems straightforward, it doesn't directly solve the problem but is used in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell independently.
   - It uses two lists, `pre` and `suffZero`, to keep track of positions where the direction changes.
   - The function iterates through the string `s1` from right to left, updating the counts and lists `preOne` and `suffZero` based on the current character.
   - It calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using these lists and prints the results.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the string `s1` and calculates the time for each cell.
   - The use of `pre` and `suffZero` lists helps in efficiently calculating the required times.
   - The overall logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
