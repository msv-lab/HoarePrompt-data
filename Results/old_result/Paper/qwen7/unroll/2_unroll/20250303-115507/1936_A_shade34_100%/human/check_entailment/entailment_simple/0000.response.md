### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized by making at most \(3n\) queries. Each query compares \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\) and returns a result indicating whether the former is less than, equal to, or greater than the latter.

2. **Analyze the Code**:
   - The code iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It makes \(n-1\) queries comparing \((p_{mak}, p_{mak})\) with \((p_i, p_i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). This step aims to identify the largest element in the permutation.
   - After identifying the largest element (`mak`), it makes further queries to find other elements that might maximize the XOR with `mak`.
   - Finally, it makes additional queries to confirm the best pair that maximizes the XOR.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The logic for finding the largest element seems correct. By comparing \((p_{mak}, p_{mak})\) with \((p_i, p_i)\), the code identifies the largest element.
   - The subsequent steps involve making more queries to find the best pair that maximizes the XOR with the identified largest element. This part of the logic also seems correct.
   - The code ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \(3n\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the basic case of finding the largest element correctly.
   - The additional queries ensure that the best pair is identified, even if there are multiple elements with the same value.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code appears to follow the problem's requirements and constraints.
   - It correctly identifies the largest element and then finds the best pair that maximizes the XOR with this element.
   - The number of queries is managed within the limit of \(3n\).
