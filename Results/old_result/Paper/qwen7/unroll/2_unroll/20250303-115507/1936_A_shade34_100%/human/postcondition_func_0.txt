The function interacts with an external entity to determine a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) and finds indices \( i \) and \( j \) that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \). It achieves this by making at most \( 3n \) queries. The function outputs two indices: the first one (\( mak2 \)) is determined early in the process, and the second one (\( pans[mak] \)) is found after comparing multiple elements.
