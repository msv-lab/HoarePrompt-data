### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\) from input.
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to store the count of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\).
     - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the code does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it uses a different approach involving the formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\), which seems to be derived from some mathematical insight but is not clearly explained.
   - The formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\) is not directly related to the problem statement and does not seem to correctly implement the required condition.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current implementation does not perform this check and instead uses an unclear formula.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It uses an incorrect formula and does not verify the required condition.
