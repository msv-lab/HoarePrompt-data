You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each pair \((a, b)\), it calculates a sum based on a specific formula and prints the sum minus one. The function does not return any explicit value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program uses a formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to calculate the number of valid pairs, which does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem description.

To verify this, let's consider a specific example:

For the input `10 8`, the expected output is `14`. However, the program calculates the result using the formula, which does not correctly account for all valid pairs.

Let's manually check some pairs to see why the program fails:

- For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 2\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(2 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 3\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(3 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), \(a + b = 4\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\). Since \(4 \mod 2 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 4\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(4 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 4\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 5\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(5 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 5\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 6\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(6 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 7\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(7 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 2\), \(a + b = 8\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\). Since \(8 \mod 4 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\), \(a + b = 9\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\). Since \(9 \mod 9 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 7\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 8\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(8 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 8\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 9\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(9 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 9\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 10\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(10 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 10\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 11\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since \(11 \mod 1 = 0\), this pair is valid.

This gives us 14 valid pairs, which matches the expected output. However, the program does not correctly calculate this result, indicating that the logic used in the program is flawed.
