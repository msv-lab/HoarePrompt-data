Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem statement and the expected solution.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The code should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check the condition.

### Code Analysis:
- The code reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
- It then uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
- Inside the loop, it calculates \(x\) using the formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\) and adds it to `suma` if the condition \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) is met.
- Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly implemented. The code instead uses a different formula that does not match the problem statement.
2. **Formula Misuse**: The formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\) is not derived from the problem requirements and does not correctly count the valid pairs.
3. **Output Format**: The code prints the result directly without returning it, which is acceptable for this problem format.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
