### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, parsing the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Position Check**:
   - The program checks if `xa` (Alice's row position) is greater than `xb` (Bob's row position). If this condition is true, it prints "Draw". This part is correct because if Alice is in a higher row than Bob, Alice cannot reach Bob's position before Bob can move away, leading to a draw.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, which represents the vertical distance between Alice and Bob. This is done using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.

4. **Odd Distance Check**:
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), the program calculates the range of possible positions for Bob and Alice. Specifically, it calculates the left (`l`) and right (`r`) bounds for Bob's possible positions.
   - It then checks if Alice can capture Bob within these bounds. If both bounds allow Alice to capture Bob (i.e., `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`), Alice can win. Otherwise, it results in a draw.

5. **Even Distance Check**:
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, the program calculates the range of possible positions for Alice and Bob similarly. It then checks if Bob can capture Alice within these bounds. If both bounds allow Bob to capture Alice (i.e., `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`), Bob can win. Otherwise, it results in a draw.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program uses list indexing to format the output string correctly based on the conditions checked.

### Conclusion:
The program logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
