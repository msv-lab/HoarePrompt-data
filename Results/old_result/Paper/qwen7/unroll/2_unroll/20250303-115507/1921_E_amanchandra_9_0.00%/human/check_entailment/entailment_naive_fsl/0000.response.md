Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the rules of the game. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Winning Condition Check**: The program checks if `xa > xb` to determine if it's a draw, which is not accurate. According to the problem description, Alice wins if she can place her chip on Bob's position, and Bob wins if he can place his chip on Alice's position. The current implementation does not check these conditions properly.

2. **Incorrect Move Logic**: The program attempts to calculate the possible moves for Alice and Bob using a simplified approach, but it does not fully consider the constraints and possible moves as described. For example, it does not correctly handle the diagonal moves for Alice or the moves for Bob.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when Alice or Bob is at the boundary of the board and cannot make certain moves. The current logic does not account for these scenarios accurately.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific test case:
- Input: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
- Expected Output: `Alice` (since Alice can move to Bob's position)

However, the provided program does not correctly determine this outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
