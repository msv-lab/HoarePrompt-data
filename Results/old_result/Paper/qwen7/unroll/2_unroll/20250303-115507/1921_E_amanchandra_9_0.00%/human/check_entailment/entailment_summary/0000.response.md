Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and processes multiple test cases.
2. It checks if `xa` (Alice's row) is greater than `xb` (Bob's row). If so, it immediately prints 'Draw', which is correct because Alice cannot catch up to Bob if she starts below him.
3. When `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, the program calculates the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` to determine the number of moves needed for Alice to potentially catch up to Bob.
4. It then calculates a range (`l` to `r`) based on this difference and checks if Alice's starting column (`ya`) or Bob's starting column (`yb`) falls within this range.
5. The logic for determining the winner based on whether `ya` or `yb` falls within the calculated range is correct:
   - If the absolute difference between `l` and `ya` or `r` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, Alice can win.
   - If the absolute difference between `l` and `yb` or `r` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`, Bob can win.
6. The program correctly handles the edge cases and follows the rules specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the provided rules.

Correctness: **True**
