Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0**

The code initializes a new variable `cnt` and assigns it the value 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cnt` and retains the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.
