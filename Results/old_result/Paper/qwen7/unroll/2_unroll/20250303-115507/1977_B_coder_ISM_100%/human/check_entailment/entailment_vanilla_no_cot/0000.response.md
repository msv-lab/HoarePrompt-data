Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Bitwise Representation**: The program attempts to represent the integer `x` in binary form but uses a fixed length of 30 bits. This is incorrect because the problem specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 32`, meaning the binary representation could have up to 32 bits.

2. **Setting Flags and Adjusting Bits**: The logic for setting flags and adjusting bits to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements is overly complex and does not always produce a valid solution. For example, the logic for handling flags and adjusting bits might not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when dealing with the maximum value of `x`.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the length and the list of bits directly, but it should ensure that the resulting array meets the criteria specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it should ensure that there are no two consecutive non-zero elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        
        # Convert x to its binary representation and store in s
        while x > 0:
            s.append(x % 2)
            x //= 2
            length += 1
        
        # Ensure the length is at most 32
        if length > 32:
            s = s[-32:]
            length = 32
        
        # Adjust the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        for i in range(length - 1):
            if s[i] != 0 and s[i + 1] != 0:
                if s[i] == 1:
                    s[i + 1] = -1
                else:
                    s[i] = -1
        
        # Output the length and the array
        print(length)
        print(*s)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary representation of `x` is correctly stored in `s`, and then adjusts the array to meet the problem's requirements.
