Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem requirements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a list `s` representing the binary representation of `x`.
   - It iterates over the bits of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
   - If the bit at position `i` is set (`x & pow(2, i)`), it appends `'1'` to the list `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting the List `s`:**
   - The program then iterates over the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to track whether the previous element was changed to `-1`.
   - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it changes the current element to `'1'` and resets the flag.
   - If `flag` is not set and the current and next elements are both `'1'`, it changes the current element to `'-'` and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the last element is `'0'`, it changes the last element to `'1'` and increments the length.
   - Otherwise, it ensures no two consecutive `-1` and `1` elements exist by swapping them if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the list `s` (which represents the number of elements in the array).
   - It then prints the elements of the list `s`.

### Verification

- **Binary Representation:** The program correctly constructs the binary representation of `x`.
- **Constraints on Adjacent Elements:** The program ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the list `s`. This is achieved by the logic within the loop that adjusts the list based on the flag.
- **Output Length and Elements:** The output length and elements match the problem constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to generate an array of integers that satisfies the given conditions.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
