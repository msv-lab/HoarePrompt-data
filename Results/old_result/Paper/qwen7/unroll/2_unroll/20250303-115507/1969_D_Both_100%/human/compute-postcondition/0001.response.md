State before the loop starts: `test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ price_i ≤ 10^9, and `bonuses` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ bonus_i ≤ 10^9.
```
for _ in range(test_cases):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop variable `_` is used, which typically means that the loop counter itself is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the value of `_` is irrelevant for the loop's execution.

2. The loop runs for `test_cases` iterations. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

3. The loop body is not provided, but the loop itself does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, or `bonuses` to execute. These variables are only used within the loop body.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
