### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined correctly to handle input parsing.
   - `func_1` reads an integer input.
   - `func_2` reads multiple space-separated integers into a tuple.
   - `func_3` calculates the total profit based on the given logic.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main function `func_4` processes each test case.
   - It initializes a min-heap (`heap`) and a list (`remaining_items`) to store items.
   - It reads the number of items `n` and the threshold `k`.
   - It reads the prices `prices` and bonuses `bonuses` for each item.
   - It converts the prices to negative values to use a min-heap for the smallest sums.
   - It combines the negative prices and bonuses into a list `combined` and sorts it based on bonuses.
   - It pushes the top `k` items with the highest bonuses into the heap.
   - If there are remaining items, it calculates the profit using `func_3`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through the remaining items, updating the profit based on whether the sum of the itemâ€™s price and bonus is non-negative.
   - It uses the heap to manage the items and update the profit accordingly.
   - The logic ensures that the maximum possible profit is calculated by considering the optimal choices for both Alice and Bob.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is zero, ensuring that Bob takes all items for free.
   - The sorting and heap operations ensure that the algorithm considers the best possible outcomes for both players.

5. **Output:**
   - The final profit is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit under the given constraints. The functions and the main logic are well-defined and handle the problem requirements accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
