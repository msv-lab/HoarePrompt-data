Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \), another positive integer \( n \), and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing only 'U' and 'D'. For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in \( s \). If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it prints each result in the list.**
