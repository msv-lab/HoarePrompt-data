### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_1` reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a common approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Parsing Data**: It then splits the input into a list of strings and iterates over the test cases.
3. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**: For each test case, it counts the number of coins facing up (`num_up_coins`).
4. **Determining Winner**: The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob wins.
5. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed out.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, forcing Bob to eventually face a situation where there are no more facing-up coins.
- Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually face a situation with no more facing-up coins.

Given this analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
