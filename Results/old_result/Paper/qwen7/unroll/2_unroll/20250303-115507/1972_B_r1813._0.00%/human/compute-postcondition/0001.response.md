Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace as the delimiter.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using the `input` function (which is set to `sys.stdin.read`), splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
