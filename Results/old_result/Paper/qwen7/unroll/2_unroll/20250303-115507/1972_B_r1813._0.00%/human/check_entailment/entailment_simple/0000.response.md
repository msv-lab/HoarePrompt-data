Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. It initializes the variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
3. It iterates over each test case, extracting `n` and `s` for each case.
4. It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and checks if this count is odd or even.
5. Based on the parity of the count of 'U', it appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list.
6. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

Given the problem statement and the example provided, the logic in the annotated program is correct. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of 'U' coins and prints the appropriate result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
