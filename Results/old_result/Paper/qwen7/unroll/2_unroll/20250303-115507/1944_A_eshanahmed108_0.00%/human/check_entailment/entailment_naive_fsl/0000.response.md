Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. In such cases, destroying `k` bridges would leave Everule unable to reach more than one island, including their own. However, the program incorrectly prints `1` in these scenarios, whereas the correct output should be `2` (since Everule can still reach island 1 and possibly another island depending on the value of `k`).

For example, consider the input `5 4`. Here, `n = 5` and `k = 4`. Destroying 4 bridges would leave at least one bridge intact, allowing Everule to visit at least 2 islands. The program incorrectly outputs `1` in this case.
