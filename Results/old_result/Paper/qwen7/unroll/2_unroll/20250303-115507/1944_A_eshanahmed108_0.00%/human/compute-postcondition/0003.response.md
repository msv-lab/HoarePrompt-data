Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of `n` and `k`.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, and `k`. It then returns specific information based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.
