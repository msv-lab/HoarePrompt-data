State: **`t` must be at least 1 and at most 2⋅10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. To determine if the loop can execute, we need to check the value of `t`.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4`.
4. Therefore, `t` must be within this range for the loop to execute.

No other variables or states need adjustment since they are not involved in the loop head conditions.
