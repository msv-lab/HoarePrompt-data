Output State: **The output state will consist of a list containing a single element, which is the index of the substring in `s` where the percentage of '0's up to that index and the percentage of '1's from that index to the end of the string both first reach or exceed 50%. If no such index exists, the list will contain either 0 or `n`, depending on whether the percentage of '1's in the entire string exceeds 50%.**

This description captures the essence of what the loop computes and outputs based on the given conditions and logic.
