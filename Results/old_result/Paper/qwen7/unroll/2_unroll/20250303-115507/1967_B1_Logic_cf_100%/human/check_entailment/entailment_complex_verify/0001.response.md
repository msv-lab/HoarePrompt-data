### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not implement the necessary logic to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The code instead increments a counter `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each \(b\) in the range from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), which does not reflect the actual condition.

However, upon closer inspection of the example test cases and the expected outputs, we notice that the provided code does indeed produce the correct results for the given examples. This suggests that despite the logical flaw, the specific implementation happens to yield the correct answers for the provided test cases due to coincidental properties or constraints.

Given that the code produces the correct output for the provided examples, and considering the constraints and nature of the problem, it is possible that the code might work correctly under the given constraints. However, this does not mean the code is logically sound or generalizable beyond the provided examples.

### Final Evaluation:

Since the code does not correctly implement the required logic but happens to produce the correct results for the given examples, we should maintain the original assessment.

Final: **False**
