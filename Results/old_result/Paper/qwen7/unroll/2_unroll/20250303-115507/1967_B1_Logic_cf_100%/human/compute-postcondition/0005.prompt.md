You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^6, and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each T in the range of t, there exists a corresponding ans which is calculated based on the given formula, and these ans values are printed individually for each T.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers `n` and `m`. The function validates that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6. Additionally, the sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6. Based on these inputs, the function determines whether the conditions are met and returns appropriate validation results for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
