Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. The provided function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function uses a loop to iterate from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`, which does not follow the problem's conditions.
3. The function should use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the current implementation does not include this check.
4. The provided code snippet does not correctly handle the problem's constraints and conditions, leading to an incorrect solution.

Correctness: **False**
