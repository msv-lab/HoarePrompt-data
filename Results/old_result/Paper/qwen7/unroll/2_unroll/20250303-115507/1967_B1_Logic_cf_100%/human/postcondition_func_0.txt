The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`. It calculates a value `ans` for each test case using a specific formula and prints the result. The function ensures that the total number of test cases `t` is within the range of 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6, with the sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^6. After processing all test cases, it prints the calculated `ans` for each test case.
