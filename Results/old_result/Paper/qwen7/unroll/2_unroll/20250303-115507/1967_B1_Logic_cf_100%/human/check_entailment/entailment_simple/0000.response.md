Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it uses the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` to calculate `ans`, which is incorrect based on the problem statement.
2. According to the problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. The annotated program does not account for the condition involving the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)) and the multiple condition. It simply increments `ans` with a value that does not reflect the problem's requirements.
4. The provided example outputs do not match the expected results for the given test cases, indicating that the logic in the program is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
