Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. According to the problem description, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The given program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach. Specifically, it calculates `ans` as `n` and then adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This approach does not correctly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- The expected output is 14.
- However, the program's output is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a counterexample:
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\):
  - \(a + b = 6 + 3 = 9\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\)
  - Since \(9\) is a multiple of \(9\), \((6, 3)\) should be counted.
- However, the program does not correctly handle this case, leading to an incorrect count.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
