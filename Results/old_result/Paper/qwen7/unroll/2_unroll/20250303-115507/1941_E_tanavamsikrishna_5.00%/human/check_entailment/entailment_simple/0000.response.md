### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` processes a single row of river depths (`row`) and updates it based on the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports (`d`).
   - For the first `d-1` elements, each element is incremented by 1.
   - For the remaining elements, each element is set to the minimum value of the previous `d` elements (including itself if applicable) plus 1.
   - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes the entire grid of river depths.
   - It reads the dimensions and the grid from the input.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row and stores the results in the `costs` list.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing up the corresponding elements in the `costs` list.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among these sets.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs, applying the logic defined in `func_1` and `func_2`, and producing the expected output.
   - The logic for updating the row costs and calculating the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
