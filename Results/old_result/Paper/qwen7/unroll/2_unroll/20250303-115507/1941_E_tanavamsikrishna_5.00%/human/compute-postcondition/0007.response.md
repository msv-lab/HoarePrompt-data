To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every consecutive `k` elements from the `costs` list.
   
2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(min(total_costs))
   ```

Given this, the `min(total_costs)` function will find the smallest value in the `total_costs` list. Since `total_costs` is constructed by summing up every consecutive `k` elements from the `costs` list, the smallest value in `total_costs` would be the sum of the `k` smallest elements from the `costs` list.

However, without the actual `costs` list and the value of `k`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the minimum element in `total_costs`. Therefore, we can only describe it in terms of the elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every consecutive k elements from the costs list)**
