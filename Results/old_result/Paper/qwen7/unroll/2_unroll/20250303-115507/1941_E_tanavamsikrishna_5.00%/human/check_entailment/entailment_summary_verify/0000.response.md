### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of installing supports in a single row of the river, ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

1. **Initial Setup**: The function starts by incrementing the cost of the first support in the row.
2. **Dynamic Cost Calculation**: For each subsequent cell, the cost is calculated as the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus one.

However, there are a few issues with this implementation:
- The function does not handle the case where the distance between supports exceeds `d`.
- The function does not enforce the mandatory installation of supports in the first and last columns.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that:
- The cost of the first and last supports is always included.
- The cost calculation respects the distance constraint `d`.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` processes the entire input and calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the dimensions and the river grid.
2. **Cost Calculation**: It applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of supports.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum cost.

Given the issues with `func_1`, the overall approach in `func_2` is flawed because it relies on an incorrect cost calculation.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve dynamic programming to ensure that the cost calculation respects the constraints. We need to keep track of the minimum cost to place supports up to each cell while respecting the distance constraint `d`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of the river. The function `func_1` does not properly handle the cost calculation according to the problem description. The function should ensure that the cost of installing supports in each cell of a row is calculated such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`, and it should also account for the mandatory installation of supports in the first and last columns of the row.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
