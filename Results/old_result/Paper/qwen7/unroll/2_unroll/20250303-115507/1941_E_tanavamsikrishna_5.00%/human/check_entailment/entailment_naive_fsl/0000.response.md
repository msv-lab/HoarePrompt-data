Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of the river. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the cost calculation according to the problem description. The function should ensure that the cost of installing supports in each cell of a row is calculated such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`, and it should also account for the mandatory installation of supports in the first and last columns of the row.

Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the following input:
```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
```

The expected minimum total cost of installing supports should be 4. However, the provided program calculates the cost incorrectly. For the second row `[0, 2, 1, 0]`, the program would calculate the cost as follows:
- For the first cell (0, 1): cost = 1 (since it's the first support and mandatory)
- For the second cell (0, 2): cost = min([1]) + 1 = 2
- For the third cell (0, 3): cost = min([2]) + 1 = 3

Thus, the total cost for the second row would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a similar method to ensure that the cost calculation respects the constraints of the problem, including the mandatory installation of supports in the first and last columns and the distance constraint between supports.
