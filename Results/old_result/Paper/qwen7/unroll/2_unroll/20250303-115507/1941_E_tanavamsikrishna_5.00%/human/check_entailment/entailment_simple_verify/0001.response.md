### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges over consecutive rows in a river grid.
   - Each row can have supports installed with a cost calculated using `func_1`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the cost of installing supports in a single row.
   - It initializes the first support cost to `row[0] + 1`.
   - For subsequent cells, it finds the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells and adds `1` to it.
   - This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It constructs the grid `rows` from the input.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row and stores these costs in `costs`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the cost for a single row.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. Specifically, the way it updates the row values does not ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is exactly `d`. Instead, it ensures that the distance is at most `d`, which might not be sufficient to meet the requirement.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

Suppose we have a row `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` and `d = 4`. According to the logic in `func_1`, the first few steps would be:

- Initialize the first support cost: `row[0] = 1`
- Update the next few elements: `row[1] = min(row[0]) + 1 = 2`, `row[2] = min(row[0:2]) + 1 = 2`, `row[3] = min(row[0:3]) + 1 = 2`, etc.

This results in the row becoming `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1]`, which does not guarantee that the distance between any two adjacent supports is exactly `d`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is exactly `d`. One way to achieve this is by maintaining a sliding window approach to ensure the minimum distance constraint is met.

### Corrected Implementation of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(row, d):
    n = len(row)
    supports = [0] * n  # Initialize a list to store the positions of supports
    supports[0] = 1  # First support is always at position 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i - supports[-1] <= d:
            supports[i] = supports[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            supports[i] = supports[supports[-1]] + 1
            supports.pop(supports[-1])
    
    return sum(row[i] + 1 for i in supports)
```

With this corrected implementation, `func_1` ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is exactly `d`.

### Conclusion:
The original implementation of `func_1` does not guarantee that the distance between any two adjacent supports is exactly `d`. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
Final: **False**
