Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which contains n lists. Each inner list has m positive integers, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0. Based on these inputs, the function returns a value.**

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `m` is an integer such that 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ m.
- `rows` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.
