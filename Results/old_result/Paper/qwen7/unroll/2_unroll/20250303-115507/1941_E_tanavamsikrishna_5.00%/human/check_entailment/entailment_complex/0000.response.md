Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `row` representing the depths of the river cells in a single row and an integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
   - It first increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1.
   - Then, for each element from index `d-1` to the end of the list, it sets the value to 1 plus the minimum value of the previous `d` elements (including itself if applicable).
   - The function returns the last element of the updated list `row`.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` takes four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` and a list of `n` lists `rows` where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells.
   - It uses `func_1` to transform each row in `rows` into a new list of costs.
   - It then calculates the sum of every consecutive `k` elements from the transformed list of costs.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from these sums.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid to minimize the total cost of installing supports.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for a single row under the given constraints.
   - The function `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each row and then finds the minimum total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

Given that both functions correctly implement the required logic and the problem description matches the implementation, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
