### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest binary string that can be formed by moving from the top-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (2, n) using only right or downward moves.
   - We also need to count the number of such paths that produce this smallest string.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 Ã— n grid.
   - The logic in `func_1()` is supposed to determine the lexicographically smallest path and count the number of such paths.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     ```python
     a = []
     n = int(input())
     for _ in range(2):
         a.append(input())
     ```
     This part correctly initializes the grid and reads the binary strings for both rows.

   - **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
     ```python
     s = []
     x = 0
     y = 0
     for i in range(n - 1):
         if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
             y = i
         if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
             s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
             x = i
             break
     else:
         s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
         x = n - 1
     ```
     - The loop checks for the first occurrence where a move from the current cell to the next cell in the same row results in a '0' and the previous cell in the other row results in a '1'. This is the key logic to form the smallest path.
     - If no such condition is met, it falls back to appending the entire first row and the last cell of the second row.

   - **Counting the Number of Paths:**
     ```python
     t = 1
     for i in range(y, x):
         if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
             t = x - i + 1
             break
     ```
     - This loop checks if the remaining part of the second row matches the corresponding part of the smallest path `s`.
     - If it does, it counts the number of such paths.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - The code prints the lexicographically smallest path and the number of such paths.

5. **Testing the Example:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code. The output matches the expected results.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for counting the number of paths. Specifically, the loop that counts the number of paths is flawed because it only checks if the remaining part of the second row matches the corresponding part of the smallest path `s`. This approach does not correctly account for all possible paths that could produce the lexicographically smallest string.

### Detailed Explanation of the Flaw:

- The code assumes that if the remaining part of the second row matches the corresponding part of the smallest path `s`, then there is exactly one path that produces this smallest string. This is incorrect because there could be multiple paths that produce the same lexicographically smallest string.

- For example, consider the following grid:
  ```
  0010
  1100
  ```
  - The lexicographically smallest path is `0000`.
  - The code would correctly identify this path, but it would incorrectly count the number of paths as 1, when in fact there are multiple paths that produce this smallest string.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly count the number of paths, we need to use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each cell while forming the lexicographically smallest path. This involves maintaining a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach the cell `(i, j)` while forming the lexicographically smallest path.

### Conclusion:
The given code is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of paths that produce the lexicographically smallest string. The original assessment overlooked this critical flaw.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
