Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), another integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2` of length `n`. It then returns a result based on the comparison of these two binary strings for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings of length `n`. The function compares these strings and returns a result for each test case.
