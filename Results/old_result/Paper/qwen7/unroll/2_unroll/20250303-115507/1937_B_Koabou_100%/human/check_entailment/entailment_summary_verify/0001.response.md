### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest binary string that can be formed by moving from the top-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (2, n) using only right or downward moves.
   - We also need to count the number of such paths that produce this smallest string.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 Ã— n grid.
   - The logic in `func_1()` is supposed to determine the lexicographically smallest path and count the number of such paths.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     ```python
     a = []
     n = int(input())
     for _ in range(2):
         a.append(input())
     ```
     This part correctly initializes the grid and reads the binary strings for both rows.

   - **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
     ```python
     s = []
     x = 0
     y = 0
     for i in range(n - 1):
         if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
             y = i
         if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
             s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
             x = i
             break
     else:
         s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
         x = n - 1
     ```
     - The loop checks for the first occurrence where a move from the current cell to the next cell in the same row results in a '0' and the previous cell in the other row results in a '1'. This is the key logic to form the smallest path.
     - If no such condition is met, it falls back to appending the entire first row and the last cell of the second row.

   - **Counting the Number of Paths:**
     ```python
     t = 1
     for i in range(y, x):
         if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
             t = x - i + 1
             break
     ```
     - This loop checks if the remaining part of the second row matches the corresponding part of the smallest path `s`.
     - If it does, it counts the number of such paths.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - The code prints the lexicographically smallest path and the number of such paths.

5. **Testing the Example:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code. The output matches the expected results.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest path is flawed. Specifically, the code only considers the first occurrence of a '0' in the first row followed by a '1' in the second row, which might not always yield the lexicographically smallest path.
- The counting logic assumes that once a match is found, the number of paths is correctly counted, but this assumption is not always valid.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest path, we should consider all possible paths and compare them.
- The counting logic needs to be revised to correctly count all paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest path and count the number of such paths. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
