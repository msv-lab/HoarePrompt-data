### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for constructing a progressive square.

#### Problem Analysis:
- A progressive square of size \( n \) is constructed using the formula \( a_{i,j} = a + i \cdot c + j \cdot d \), where \( a \) is the minimum value in the square, and \( i, j \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- The program should check if the given list of numbers can be rearranged to form such a square.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and the list of \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It finds the minimum value \( a \) in the list.
   - It generates a list `li` of length \( n^2 \) where each element is calculated as \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for \( k \) and \( h \) ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - It sorts both the original list `l` and the generated list `li`.
   - It checks if the sorted lists are equal and returns 'yes' if they are, otherwise 'no'.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) is correct for generating the progressive square.
- **Sorting and Comparison:**
  - Sorting both lists ensures that the order of elements is considered.
  - If the sorted lists are equal, it means the original list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input:
    ```
    3 2 3
    3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
    ```
  - Expected Output: "NO"
  - Explanation:
    - The minimum value \( a \) is 1.
    - The generated list `li` should be: \( [1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11] \).
    - The original list `l` is: \( [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8] \).
    - After sorting, `li` and `l` are not equal, so the program correctly returns "NO".

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input:
    ```
    3 2 3
    3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8
    ```
  - Expected Output: "YES"
  - Explanation:
    - The minimum value \( a \) is 1.
    - The generated list `li` should be: \( [1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11] \).
    - The original list `l` is: \( [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8] \).
    - After sorting, `li` and `l` are equal, so the program correctly returns "YES".

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input:
    ```
    2 100 100
    400 300 400 500
    ```
  - Expected Output: "YES"
  - Explanation:
    - The minimum value \( a \) is 300.
    - The generated list `li` should be: \( [300, 500, 400, 600] \).
    - The original list `l` is: \( [400, 300, 400, 500] \).
    - After sorting, `li` and `l` are equal, so the program correctly returns "YES".

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input:
    ```
    3 2 3
    3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8
    ```
  - Expected Output: "NO"
  - Explanation:
    - The minimum value \( a \) is 1.
    - The generated list `li` should be: \( [1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11] \).
    - The original list `l` is: \( [3, 9, 6, 6, 5, 1, 11, 4, 8] \).
    - After sorting, `li` and `l` are not equal, so the program correctly returns "NO".

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input:
    ```
    4 4 4
    15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15
    ```
  - Expected Output: "NO"
  - Explanation:
    - The minimum value \( a \) is 3.
    - The generated list `li` should be: \( [3, 7, 11, 15, 15, 19, 23, 27, 15, 19, 23, 27, 11, 15, 19, 23] \).
    - The original list `l` is: \( [15, 27, 7, 19, 23, 23, 11, 15, 7, 3, 19, 23, 11, 15, 11, 15] \).
    - After sorting, `li` and `l` are not equal, so the program correctly returns "NO".

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given list can be rearranged to form such a square. The original assessment was incorrect because the program does work as intended.
