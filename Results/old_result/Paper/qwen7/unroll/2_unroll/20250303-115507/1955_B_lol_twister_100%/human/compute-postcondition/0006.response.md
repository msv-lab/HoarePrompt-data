Output State: **`a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6; `li` is a list containing 250000 elements sorted in ascending order, each element being `a + k*c + d*h` where `k` and `h` range from 0 to 499; `l` is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `l` is that `a` is the minimum value in the list, after sorting, `l` will be in ascending order, but the minimum value `a` remains the same. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and `li` remain unchanged.
