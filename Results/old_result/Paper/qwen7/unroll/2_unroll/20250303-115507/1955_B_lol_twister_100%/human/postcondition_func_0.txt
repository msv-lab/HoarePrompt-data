The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n` (with 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), two integers `c` and `d` (with 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and a list `l` of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9). It calculates a new list `li` based on the minimum value in `l` and the parameters `c` and `d`. Both `li` and `l` are then sorted. If the sorted lists `l` and `li` are identical, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
