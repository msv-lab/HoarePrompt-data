Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is almost correct but has a minor issue in the function `func_1`. The function should check if the generated progressive square matches the given list `l` after sorting both lists. However, the current implementation uses a fixed starting value `a` which is the minimum value in the list `l`. This approach might not always generate the correct progressive square because the starting value `a` should be calculated based on the initial element of the progressive sequence, not just the minimum value in the list.

To fix this, we need to correctly calculate the starting value `a` and ensure the sequence generation logic is accurate. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    # Calculate the starting value a
    a = (min(l) - d * (n - 1)) // c
    # Generate the progressive square
    li = [a + k * c + d * h for k in range(n) for h in range(n)]
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

With this correction, the function should work as expected. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed calculation of the starting value `a`.
