Output State: **`a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6; `li` is a list containing 250000 elements sorted in ascending order, each element being `a + k*c + d*h` where `k` and `h` range from 0 to 499.**

Explanation: The code `li.sort()` sorts the list `li` in ascending order. Since the elements of `li` are defined as `a + k*c + d*h` where `k` and `h` range from 0 to 499, the smallest element will be when both `k` and `h` are 0, which is `a`. The sorting operation does not change the values of `a`, `n`, `c`, `d`, or the formula for the elements of `li`; it only changes the order of the elements in the list.
