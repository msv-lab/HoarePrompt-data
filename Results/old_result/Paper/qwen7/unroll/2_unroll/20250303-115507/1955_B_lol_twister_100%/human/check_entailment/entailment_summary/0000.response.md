Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies the smallest element in the input list `l`.
2. It then generates a new list `li` by calculating the progressive square values using the formula \(a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h\) for \(k\) and \(h\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\).
3. Both the generated list `li` and the original list `l` are sorted.
4. Finally, it checks if the sorted lists are equal and returns 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` matches the requirements. The function correctly generates the expected progressive square values and compares them with the given list to determine if they match.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
