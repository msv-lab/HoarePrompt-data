Output State: **`casos` is an input integer, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The variable `casos` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds the integer input from the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 20.
