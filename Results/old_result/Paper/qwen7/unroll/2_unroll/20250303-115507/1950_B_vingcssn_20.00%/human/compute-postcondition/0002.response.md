Output State: The output will consist of multiple patterns printed based on the value of `n` for each iteration of the loop. For each valid `n` (1, 2, 3, or 4), a specific pattern will be printed according to the conditions given. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, 'No esta en el rango' will be printed for that iteration. The number of times the loop runs is determined by the value of `casos`. Each pattern is printed on separate lines, and there will be no additional output outside these patterns and error messages.
