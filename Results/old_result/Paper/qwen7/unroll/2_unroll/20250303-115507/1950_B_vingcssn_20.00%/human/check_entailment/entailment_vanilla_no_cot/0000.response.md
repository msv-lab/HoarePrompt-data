Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution only handles the cases for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` explicitly and does not provide a general solution for any `n` within the given constraints. For larger values of `n`, the program will print "No esta en el rango" (which means "is not in the range" in Spanish), which is incorrect according to the problem statement. Additionally, the pattern for the checkerboard is not correctly generated for these specific cases either. A correct solution should use a loop to generate the checkerboard pattern dynamically for any `n`.
