Output State: The output will consist of multiple sections, each corresponding to the value of `n` provided for each iteration of the loop. For each `n`, the output will display a specific pattern printed according to the conditions given in the loop. If `n` is outside the specified range (1 to 4), it will print "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range") for that iteration. Each section of the output will be separated by blank lines.
