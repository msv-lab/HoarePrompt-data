Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard for any n > 4. For example, if n = 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range" in English), indicating that it cannot handle values outside the hardcoded conditions. This violates the problem description which requires the program to generate a checkerboard for any n within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
