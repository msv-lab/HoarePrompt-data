Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the score. Specifically, the program always pops the first two elements from the sorted list, which does not necessarily result in the maximum score. For example, consider the input:

```
3
2
4 1 2 3
```

The correct approach would be to pair the smallest and largest numbers available at each step to maximize the score. However, the current implementation simply pops the first two elements, which may not yield the optimal score. For instance, in the above example, the optimal pairing would be (1, 4), (2, 3), resulting in a score of \(1 + 2 = 3\). Instead, the program would calculate \(1 + 2 = 3\) but could potentially miss the optimal solution.
