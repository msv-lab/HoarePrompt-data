### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: The list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This ensures that the smallest numbers are always chosen first when pairs are selected.
3. **Pair Selection and Scoring**: For each pair of numbers, the minimum value is added to the score. Since the list is sorted, the minimum values are always the first two elements in the list at each iteration.
4. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until all numbers are processed, which happens after exactly \( n \) iterations since \( n \) pairs are formed.
5. **Output**: The score is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly computes the maximum final score by always selecting the smallest available numbers to maximize the sum of the minimums.
