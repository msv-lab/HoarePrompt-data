Reasoning:

1. The main logic of the program is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
2. The `func_1` function is responsible for checking this condition and returning necessary values.
3. In `func_1`, `s1` collects all characters from `s` that are in the set `alphabet`, and `s2` collects the last character from `s` if `len(alphabet)` was originally 1.
4. After processing `s`, the function checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. If so, it means all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
5. If the condition is not met, it constructs a counterexample string of length `n` that cannot be found as a subsequence in `s`.
6. The main loop processes each test case and prints the appropriate output based on the result of `func_1`.

Given the logic and the provided state information, the program correctly implements the required functionality. It checks if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s` and provides a counterexample if they do not.

Correctness: **True**
