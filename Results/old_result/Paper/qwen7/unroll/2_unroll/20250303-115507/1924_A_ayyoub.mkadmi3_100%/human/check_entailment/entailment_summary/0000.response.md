Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly filters the input string `s` to keep only characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `s1` is constructed by appending these filtered characters.
   - `s2` is constructed to contain the last character from `s1` if `s1` originally contained exactly one character from the first `k` alphabets, or it is left empty otherwise.
   - The function checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a boolean indicating this condition, along with substrings of `s1` and `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` and checking the returned values.
   - If `func_1` returns `False` (meaning `s1` is less than `n * k`), it prints "NO" and generates a string of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets that is not a subsequence of `s`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are checked against `s`.
   - The generation of a non-subsequence string in the case of `False` is handled correctly by ensuring the generated string uses only the first `k` alphabets and is not a subsequence of `s`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
