### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` and `s2`.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s` and checks if it belongs to the `alphabet`.
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element.
     - Otherwise, it appends the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to its initial state.
     - It appends the character to `s1` in all cases.
   - After the loop, it calculates the quotient `r` of `len(s1)` divided by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

2. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` and stores the result.
   - If the first element of the returned tuple is `False`, it appends 'No' to `OUT` and constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using the first available character in `alphabet` that is not in `s1`. It then appends this string to `s2` and adds the result to `OUT`.
   - If the first element is `True`, it appends 'Yes' to `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints each element in `OUT`.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies if the string `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The main program logic correctly handles both cases (YES and NO) and prints the appropriate output.
   - The construction of `be9i` ensures that a valid string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` is generated when necessary.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
