Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and appends characters to `s1` if they are in `alphabet`.
   - If `alphabet` originally had only one character, it appends that character to `s2`.
   - Finally, it calculates `r` as `len(s1) // k` and returns a tuple with:
     - A boolean indicating if `len(s1) >= n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it appends 'No' to the output list `OUT` and constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using the first character not in `s1`.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'Yes' to the output list `OUT`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets as a subsequence of `s`.
   - The main logic correctly handles the conditions and outputs the required results.
   - The construction of `be9i` ensures that a string not present as a subsequence is generated if needed.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
