### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` and `s2`.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if each character is in `alphabet`.
     - If it is, it removes the character from `alphabet` if more than one character is needed.
     - It adds the character to both `s1` and `s2`.
   - After processing the string `s`, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - Finally, it returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` to get the result.
   - If the first element of the returned tuple is `False`, it appends 'No' to the output list `OUT`.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'Yes' to `OUT`.
   - If 'No' is appended, it constructs a string `be9i` using the first available character from `alphabet` that is not in `s1` and appends it to `s2`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` alphabets as subsequences.
   - The main program correctly handles the logic for constructing and checking subsequences.
   - The construction of `be9i` ensures that a non-subsequence string is generated if necessary.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately checks if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s` and generates a suitable non-subsequence string if required.

**Correctness: True**
