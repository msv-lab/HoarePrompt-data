Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and `k` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `k` <= 26 and 1 <= `m` <= 1000.**

The code initializes `s1` as an empty string. No changes are made to `s`, `k`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
