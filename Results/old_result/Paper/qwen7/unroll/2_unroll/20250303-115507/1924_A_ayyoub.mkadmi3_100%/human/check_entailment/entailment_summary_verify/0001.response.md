### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly filters out characters from `s` that are within the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and constructs `s1` and `s2` accordingly.
   - However, there is a potential issue with how `s2` is constructed. Specifically, `s2` is only updated if `s1` originally contained exactly one character from the first `k` alphabets. This means that if `s1` contains multiple characters, `s2` will remain empty, which might lead to incorrect results in the main program.

2. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program logic is mostly correct. It correctly calls `func_1` and processes the results.
   - The construction of `be9i` is intended to generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` if `s1` does not contain all possible subsequences. However, due to the issue with `s2` in `func_1`, this logic might not work as expected in all cases.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` does not always correctly identify if `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Specifically, if `s1` contains multiple characters, `s2` will be empty, leading to incorrect results in the main program.
   - The main program logic relies on `s2` being correctly constructed, but since `s2` is not always updated correctly, the program might produce incorrect outputs.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
