Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `s2` is an empty string, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and `k` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `k` <= 26 and 1 <= `m` <= 1000.**

In this case, the code simply initializes `s2` as an empty string. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of all variables.
