Output State: `s1` is a string consisting of all characters from `s` that are in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, with duplicates removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`. If `len(alphabet) == 1`, then `s2` is the string of the single character repeated `n` times and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `s2` is empty otherwise.
