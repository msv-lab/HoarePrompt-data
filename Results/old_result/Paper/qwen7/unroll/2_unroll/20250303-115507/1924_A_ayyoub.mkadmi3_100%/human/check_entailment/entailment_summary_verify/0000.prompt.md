You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
    if not b:
        OUT.append('No')
        i = 97
        while i <= k + 97:
            if chr(i) not in s1:
                break
            i += 1
        be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
        OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
    else:
        OUT.append('Yes')
for i in OUT:
    print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s`, a positive integer `k`, and another positive integer `n`. It filters `s` to create two new strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` contains all characters from `s` that are within the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, while `s2` contains either the last character from `s1` if `s1` originally contained exactly one character from the first `k` alphabets, or is empty otherwise. The function then checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, and returns this check result along with a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` (where `r` is the length of `s1` divided by `k`) to the end, and the string `s2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` aims to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets as a subsequence of `s`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not properly account for all possible subsequences. It only checks for the presence of characters in `s` and removes them from the set `alphabet`, but it does not ensure that all combinations of these characters form valid subsequences.

2. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3 3 10
     aabbccabab
     ```
   - The program should output `YES` because all possible strings of length 3 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c') can be found as subsequences in `aabbccabab` (e.g., "abc", "acb", "bac", etc.).
   - However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` and prints "ccc" as a string that cannot be found as a subsequence, which is incorrect.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program fails to handle the case where the string `s` contains enough characters to form all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The function `func_1` does not properly validate all combinations of subsequences, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
