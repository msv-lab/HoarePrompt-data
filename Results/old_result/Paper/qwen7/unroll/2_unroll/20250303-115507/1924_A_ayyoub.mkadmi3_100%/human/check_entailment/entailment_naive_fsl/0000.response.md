Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` aims to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets as a subsequence of `s`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not properly account for all possible subsequences. It only checks for the presence of characters in `s` and removes them from the set `alphabet`, but it does not ensure that all combinations of these characters form valid subsequences.

2. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3 3 10
     aabbccabab
     ```
   - The program should output `YES` because all possible strings of length 3 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c') can be found as subsequences in `aabbccabab` (e.g., "abc", "acb", "bac", etc.).
   - However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` and prints "ccc" as a string that cannot be found as a subsequence, which is incorrect.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program fails to handle the case where the string `s` contains enough characters to form all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The function `func_1` does not properly validate all combinations of subsequences, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
