Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It doesn't correctly check for subsequences or ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are covered.
   - Specifically, the logic to remove characters from `alphabet` and then check if the remaining characters form a valid subsequence is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Output**:
   - The main loop constructs the output list `OUT` but does not properly handle the case when `b` is `False`. The current implementation assumes that `s2` will always be a valid subsequence, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Incorrect Character Selection**:
   - The selection of characters to form the invalid subsequence (`be9i`) is not optimal. The current approach might not select the correct character that forms an invalid subsequence.

### Corrected Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabet = set(chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k))
    possible_subsequences = set()
    
    # Generate all possible subsequences of length n
    def generate_subsequences(s, index, path, k, n):
        if len(path) == n:
            possible_subsequences.add(''.join(path))
            return
        for i in range(index, len(s)):
            if s[i] in alphabet:
                generate_subsequences(s, i + 1, path + [s[i]], k, n)
    
    generate_subsequences(s, 0, [], k, n)
    
    # Check if all possible subsequences are present in s
    if len(possible_subsequences) == 1 << n:
        OUT.append('YES')
    else:
        OUT.append('NO')
        # Find a subsequence that is missing
        for subseq in [''.join(p) for p in itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=n)]:
            if subseq not in possible_subsequences:
                OUT.append(subseq)
                break

for i in OUT:
    print(i)
```

This solution uses a recursive function to generate all possible subsequences of length `n` and checks if they are present in the string `s`. If all subsequences are found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO' and a missing subsequence.
