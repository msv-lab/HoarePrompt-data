Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing elements based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, if the input string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and has '11' as a substring, the list `results` appends 'no'. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and meets the previous condition, it also appends 'no', otherwise it appends 'yes'. If the number of '1's is odd, it appends 'no'.
