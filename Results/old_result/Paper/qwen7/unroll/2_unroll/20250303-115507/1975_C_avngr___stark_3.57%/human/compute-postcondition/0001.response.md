State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is not yet defined**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains two variables: `_` and `t`.
- `_` is a placeholder variable used in the `range()` function and does not require an initial value since its purpose is to iterate over the range generated by `range(t)`.
- `t` is the variable that determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` meets the specified condition.
