Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input Types**: The program converts the input strings to lists of strings instead of integers. This is incorrect because the input should be treated as integers.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `pairs_in_D`**: The program calculates `pairs_in_D` only once before entering the loop. It should be updated within the loop as elements are added and removed from the sliding window.

3. **Incorrect Update Logic**: The logic for updating the counters `E` and `C` and the variable `pairs_in_D` is flawed. Specifically, the decrementing and incrementing operations do not correctly reflect the changes in the sliding window.

4. **Incorrect Condition for `fnd` Increment**: The condition for incrementing `fnd` is incorrect. It should check if the current window satisfies the requirement of having at least `k` matches with `bb`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        (n, m, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        # Initialize counters
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        E = cnt_aa - D
        C = cnt_bb - D
        
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        for i in range(m, n):
            # Remove the element that is sliding out of the window
            if D[aa[i - m]] > 0:
                if E[aa[i - m]] > 0:
                    E[aa[i - m]] -= 1
                else:
                    D[aa[i - m]] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                    C[aa[i - m]] += 1
            else:
                E[aa[i - m]] -= 1
            
            # Add the new element that is sliding into the window
            if C[aa[i]] > 0:
                D[aa[i]] += 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
                C[aa[i]] -= 1
            else:
                E[aa[i]] += 1
            
            # Check if the current window satisfies the requirement
            if pairs_in_D >= k:
                fnd += 1
        
        print(fnd)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the sliding window and updates the counters and `pairs_in_D` correctly.
