Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be designed for a different problem involving paths with special characters ('@' and '*'), rather than calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse occur based on their periodicities. The logic and structure of these functions are irrelevant to the given problem. A correct solution would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, considering the sequential nature of the occurrences.
