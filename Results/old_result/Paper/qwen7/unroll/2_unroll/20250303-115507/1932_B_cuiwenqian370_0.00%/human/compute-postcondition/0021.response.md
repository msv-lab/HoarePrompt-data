Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-inf` and all other elements are 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 1; `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `path[0]` is either '@' or '*', and the first element of `dp` remains `-inf`; the second element of `path` is '*', and the first element of `dp` remains `-inf`.**

Explanation: The code `dp[1] = -float('inf')` changes the value of `dp[1]` from 0 to `-inf`. All other elements of `dp` remain unchanged as they are still 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `path[0]`, and the second element of `path` remain the same as per the initial state.
