You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` to keep track of certain values based on the characters in `path`. Depending on the first character of `path`, `dp[0]` is set to either 1 or `-inf`. For subsequent characters, `dp[i]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if the current character is '@', or just the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` if the current character is '*'. Finally, the function returns 0 if no valid value in `dp` is greater than `-inf`, otherwise it returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than `-inf`.

For each group, it calls `func_1` with a path string and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result from the collected list.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year in which all \(n\) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, based on their periodicities. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address this requirement at all. Instead, they seem to be related to processing a string with `@` and `*` characters, which is completely unrelated to the problem statement.

To solve the given problem, the program should calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities \(a_i\). The LCM will give the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    return reduce(lcm, periods)

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        path = data[2]
        periods = list(map(int, path.split()))
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected program calculates the LCM of the periodicities for each test case and prints the result. This approach ensures that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
