Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases, and the input reading process starts using `sys.stdin.read`.**

Explanation: The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` function to read from `sys.stdin` directly. This does not change the value of `t` or any other variables. It just changes how input is read from the standard input. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged and still represents the number of test cases within the given range.
