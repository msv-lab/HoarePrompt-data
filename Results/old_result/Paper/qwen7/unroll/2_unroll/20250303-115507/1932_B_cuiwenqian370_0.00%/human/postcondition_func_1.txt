The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of data. Each group includes an integer `n` indicating the number of signs, and `n` space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs. For each group, it calls `func_1` with a path string and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result from the collected list.
