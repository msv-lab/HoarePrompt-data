Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` and the range function. The variable `t` is used as the upper limit for the range function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the given state before the loop, `t` is an integer equal to the first element in the list `data`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace. This does not need to be adjusted since it is already defined.
   - `index` is 1 and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `results` is an empty list and does not need to be adjusted since it is already defined.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, data is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, index is 1, results is an empty list**
