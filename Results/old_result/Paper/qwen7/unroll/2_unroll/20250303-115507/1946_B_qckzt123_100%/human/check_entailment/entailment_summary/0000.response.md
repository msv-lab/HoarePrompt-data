Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`.
3. It calculates the initial sum of the array `s` and finds the maximum prefix sum `t` that can be achieved without negative contributions.
4. The program then iteratively doubles `t` up to `k-1` times and adds these values to the initial sum `s`, ensuring all operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
5. The logic for doubling `t` and adding it to the sum `ans` ensures that the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is calculated correctly.
6. The program handles large inputs and performs operations efficiently within the constraints.

Given the execution summary and the detailed explanation, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
