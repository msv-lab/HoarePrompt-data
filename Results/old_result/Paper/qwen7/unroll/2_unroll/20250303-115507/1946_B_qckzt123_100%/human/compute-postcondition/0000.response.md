Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, MOD is 1000000007**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `MOD` with the value `1000000007`. This assignment does not affect the value of `t` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `MOD`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range remains unchanged.
