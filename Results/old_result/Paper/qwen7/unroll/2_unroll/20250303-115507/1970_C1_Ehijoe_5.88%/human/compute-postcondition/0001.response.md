Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `tree` is an empty deque.**

The code initializes an empty deque named `tree`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, or `n`, but it introduces a new variable `tree` which is now an empty deque. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, and `n` are updated to the values entered by the user.
