Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` remains the same input integer, `u` and `v` are integers that were processed during the loop, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, `tree` is a deque containing integers `u` and `v` from the input, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the `start` element within the `tree` deque and assigns it to the variable `idx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
