Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program does not properly handle the splitting of the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) to minimize the penalty \(p(s) + p(t)\).

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program outputs `0` because it does not correctly identify the optimal way to split the array. Specifically, the program attempts to find the first increasing pair and then tries to maximize the number of increasing pairs in the remaining part of the array, which does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it into two parts such that the number of increasing subsequences is minimized. This can be achieved by identifying the longest decreasing subsequence and then splitting the array accordingly.
