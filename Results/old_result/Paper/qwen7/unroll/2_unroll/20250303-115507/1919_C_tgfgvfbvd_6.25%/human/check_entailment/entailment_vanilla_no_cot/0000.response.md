Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Arrays**: The program attempts to split the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` but does not follow the rules properly. Specifically, it tries to find the first increasing pair and then splits the array based on this condition, which is not optimal.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The program counts the number of times an element is greater than the previous one after a certain point, which does not align with the problem's requirement of splitting into two subsequences to minimize the total penalty.

3. **Subsequence Definition**: The program does not ensure that every element is included in either `s` or `t`. It also does not handle the case where the array is already sorted or nearly sorted efficiently.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a different approach. One efficient way is to sort the array and then count the number of inversions (i.e., pairs (i, j) such that i < j and a[i] > a[j]). This count will give us the minimum penalty because sorting the array minimizes the number of increasing subsequences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Sort the array
        l.sort()
        # Calculate the penalty
        penalty = sum(1 for i in range(1, n) if l[i] > l[i-1])
        print(penalty)

func()
```

This program sorts the array and then counts the number of times an element is greater than its predecessor, which gives the minimum possible penalty.
