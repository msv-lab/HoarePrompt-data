Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it counts the number of elements in the list that are either greater than both their preceding and succeeding elements, or are the smallest or largest element between two such elements in the list. The function then prints the count for each test case.**
