Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, an input string of length 5 consisting of the letters 'A' and 'B'. The function returns a value based on the input strings for each test case, ensuring all t strings across all test cases are distinct.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters when called, but it implicitly handles `t` test cases, each with a unique 5-character string made up of 'A' and 'B'. The function processes these strings and returns a result for each test case, ensuring no repetition among the input strings.
