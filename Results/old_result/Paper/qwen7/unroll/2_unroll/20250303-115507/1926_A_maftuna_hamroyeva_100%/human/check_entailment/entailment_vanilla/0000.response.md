### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Counting**: For each test case, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `l` and `h`, respectively.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases where the string can be composed of any combination of 'A' and 'B', including cases with equal counts of 'A' and 'B'. However, since the problem specifies that the string is of length 5, there will always be a clear majority (at least 3 out of 5 characters will be the same), so the program does not need to handle the case where `l` equals `h`.
5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the correct character for each test case as per the problem statement.

Given that the program follows the problem requirements accurately and handles all possible test cases correctly, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
