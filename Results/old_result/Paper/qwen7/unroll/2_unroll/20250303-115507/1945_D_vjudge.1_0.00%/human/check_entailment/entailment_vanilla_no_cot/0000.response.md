Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. The current implementation reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. Additionally, the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the prefix sum for b values
    prefix_sum_b = [0] * n
    prefix_sum_b[0] = lista_B[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sum_b[i] = prefix_sum_b[i-1] + lista_B[i]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(m, n):
        cost = lista_A[i] + prefix_sum_b[i-1]
        resultado = min(resultado, cost)
    
    # Add the cost for moving to the first m-1 positions
    for i in range(m-1):
        cost = lista_A[i]
        resultado = min(resultado, cost)
    
    print(resultado)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the function to solve the problem
func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We calculate the prefix sum of `b` values to efficiently compute the cumulative cost of moving through the queue.
2. **Cost Calculation**: For each position from `m` to `n-1`, we calculate the cost of moving to that position and update the minimum cost.
3. **Initial Positions**: We also consider the cost of being in the first `m-1` positions directly.
4. **Result**: The minimum cost is printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that the solution correctly computes the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue.
