### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue.
   - Kirill can swap positions with anyone in front of him, paying `a_j` coins for the initial swap and `b_k` coins for each subsequent swap between `j` and `k`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes input parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is the total number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill), and `k` is the maximum allowable final position for Kirill.
   - It reads two lists of integers, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.
   - The function reverses these lists, which is unnecessary since the original order is used in the logic.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to 0 and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n-k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, setting `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - It then iterates through the last `k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - For each element, it calculates the minimum cost by adding `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
     - It updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` has a critical flaw in the way it handles the cost accumulation.
   - Specifically, the function incorrectly accumulates the costs. The variable `soma_b` is supposed to accumulate the costs of intermediate swaps, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the accumulation and resetting of `soma_b`.
   - The function should keep track of the cumulative cost of swaps correctly, but the current implementation does not do this properly.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     - Input:
       ```
       4
       4 2
       7 3 6 9
       4 3 8 5
       ```
     - Expected Output:
       ```
       14
       ```
   - Let's manually verify the steps:
     - For the first test case:
       - `n = 4`, `k = 2`
       - `lista_A = [9, 6, 3, 7]`
       - `lista_B = [5, 8, 3, 4]`
     - Iterating through the first `n-k` elements (i.e., the first 2 elements):
       - `i = 0`: `lista_A[0] = 9`, `lista_B[0] = 5`
         - Since `9 > 5`, `soma_b = 5`
       - `i = 1`: `lista_A[1] = 6`, `lista_B[1] = 8`
         - Since `6 < 8`, `pref = 5 + 6 = 11`, `soma_b = 0`
     - Iterating through the last `k` elements (i.e., the last 2 elements):
       - `i = 2`: `lista_A[2] = 3`, `lista_B[2] = 3`
         - Since `3 < 3`, `pref = 11 + 3 = 14`, `soma_b = 0`
       - `i = 3`: `lista_A[3] = 7`, `lista_B[3] = 4`
         - Since `7 > 4`, `soma_b = 4`
     - The final result is `14`, which matches the expected output.

   - However, the function does not correctly handle the accumulation of costs for intermediate swaps. The current implementation does not correctly reset `soma_b` and accumulate the costs properly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem due to the incorrect handling of cost accumulation.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` itself is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
