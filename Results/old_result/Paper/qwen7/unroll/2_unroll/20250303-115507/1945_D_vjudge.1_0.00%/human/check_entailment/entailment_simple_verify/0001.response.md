### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue.
   - Kirill can swap positions with anyone in front of him, paying `a_j` coins for the initial swap and `b_k` coins for each subsequent swap between `j` and `k`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes input parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is the total number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill), and `k` is the maximum allowable final position for Kirill.
   - It reads two lists of integers, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.
   - The function reverses these lists, which is unnecessary since the original order is used in the logic.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to 0 and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n-k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, setting `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - It then iterates through the last `k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - For each element, it calculates the minimum cost by adding `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
     - It updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The function assumes that swapping positions only happens once per person, but it does not account for the possibility of multiple swaps involving the same person. This means that the function might miss optimal solutions where multiple swaps are beneficial.
   - Specifically, the function only considers the cost of moving Kirill past each person once, without considering the cumulative effect of multiple swaps. For example, if `lista_A[i] > lista_B[i]` for many consecutive `i`, the function might not find the optimal path because it only considers the cost of the first swap.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code shows that the function iterates through the first `n-k` elements and then the last `k` elements. However, the logic inside the loops does not correctly handle the cumulative effect of multiple swaps.
   - The `soma_b` variable is used to accumulate the cost of swaps, but it is reset to 0 when `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, which is incorrect because it should continue accumulating the cost of subsequent swaps involving the same person.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem due to the flawed logic that does not account for multiple swaps involving the same person.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program is also incorrect.
