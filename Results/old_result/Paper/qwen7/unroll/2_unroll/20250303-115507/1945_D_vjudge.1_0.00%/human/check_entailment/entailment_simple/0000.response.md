Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves finding the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue by exchanging positions with people in front of him. The cost includes both `a_i` (cost to swap with the person directly in front) and `b_i` (cost for each person in between).

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the input values for `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`.
   - It reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` which is unnecessary since the problem does not specify any need for reversal.
   - It initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to handle the cumulative costs.
   - The loop from `0` to `n - k - 1` calculates the prefix sum of `soma_b` when `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, otherwise it accumulates `soma_b`.
   - The loop from `n - k` to `n - 1` calculates the minimum cost by considering the accumulated values of `pref` and `soma_b`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through them and calling `func_1` for each.
   - The overall structure is correct and ensures that each test case is processed independently.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum cost calculated by `func_1`.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and structure appear to be correct for solving the problem as described. The unnecessary reversal of lists does not affect the correctness of the solution since the problem does not specify any dependency on the order of elements in the lists.

Correctness: **True**
