Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`. It returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

- The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- It also accepts two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, both of length `n`, where each element in the lists satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\).

The exact return value is not specified in the given information, but based on the constraints and the nature of the parameters, the function likely performs some operation involving the elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` under the given conditions.
