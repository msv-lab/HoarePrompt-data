Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the top \( m \) positions in a queue, where the cost includes bribing people in front of him and paying a penalty for each intermediate person.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function processes a single test case. It takes \( n \) and \( k \) as inputs, along with two lists \( \text{lista\_A} \) and \( \text{lista\_B} \). It reverses these lists and calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the top \( m \) (where \( m = n - k + 1 \)).
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case using `func_1`.

3. **Execution Summaries**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - Reverses the input lists \( \text{lista\_A} \) and \( \text{lista\_B} \).
     - Initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to zero.
     - Iterates through the first \( n - k \) elements of the reversed lists.
       - If the element in \( \text{lista\_A} \) is less than the corresponding element in \( \text{lista\_B} \), it updates `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
       - Otherwise, it adds the element in \( \text{lista\_B} \) to `soma_b`.
     - For the remaining elements (from \( n - k \) to \( n-1 \)), it calculates the minimum cost by adding `pref`, `soma_b`, and the current element in \( \text{lista\_A} \).
     - Prints the minimum cost.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - Reads the number of test cases.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case by considering the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - The reversal of lists and the specific logic for calculating costs ensure that the solution adheres to the problem constraints.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one and printing the results.

Given the detailed analysis and the execution summaries, the provided functions correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
