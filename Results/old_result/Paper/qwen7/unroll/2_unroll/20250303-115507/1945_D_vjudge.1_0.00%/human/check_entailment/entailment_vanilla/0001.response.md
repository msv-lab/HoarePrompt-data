### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue.
   - Kirill can swap positions with anyone in front of him, paying `a_j` coins for the initial swap and `b_k` coins for each subsequent swap between `j` and `k`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes input parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is the total number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill), and `k` is the maximum allowable final position for Kirill.
   - It reads two lists of integers, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.
   - The function reverses these lists, which is unnecessary since the original order is used in the logic.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to 0 and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n-k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, setting `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - It then iterates through the last `k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - For each element, it calculates the minimum cost by adding `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
     - It updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - The reversal of the lists is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.
   - The approach of iterating through the first `n-k` elements and then the last `k` elements ensures that all necessary swaps are considered.
   - The use of `pref` and `soma_b` correctly accumulates the costs as required.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the solution to the problem.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
