Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then iterates through each test case, parsing \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\). It also correctly reads the list of \(x\) chosen vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The list of chosen vertices is sorted, which is necessary to calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices.
3. **Gap Calculation**: The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and increments the count for each gap greater than 1. This is correct because each gap represents a potential triangle that can be formed.
4. **Final Gap Calculation**: After processing the gaps between the chosen vertices, the program calculates the gap between the last chosen vertex and the total number of vertices \(n\). If this gap is 1, it increments the count.
5. **Output Calculation**: The final output is calculated as the sum of the count of gaps plus \(x - 2\). This is correct because the number of triangles that can be formed is equal to the number of gaps plus the initial \(x - 2\) triangles that can be formed within the first \(x\) vertices.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
