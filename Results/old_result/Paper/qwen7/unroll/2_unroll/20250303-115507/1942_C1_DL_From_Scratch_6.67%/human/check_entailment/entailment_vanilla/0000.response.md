Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
2. The solution provided counts the number of gaps between the chosen vertices to determine how many additional triangles can be formed.
3. For each gap of length greater than 1, a triangle can be formed. Additionally, if the remaining segment after the last chosen vertex is of length greater than 1, another triangle can be formed.
4. The code correctly calculates the number of gaps of length greater than 1 between consecutive chosen vertices and checks the remaining segment after the last chosen vertex.
5. However, the problem specifies that `y = 0`, meaning no additional vertices can be chosen. Therefore, the code should not include any logic related to `y`.
6. The current implementation correctly handles the logic for counting gaps without considering `y`, which is always zero in this version of the problem.
7. The output format and constraints are also correctly handled.

Given the above points, the provided solution is correct for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
