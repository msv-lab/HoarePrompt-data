Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a string s2. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases provided. For each test case, if the length of the input string s is 1 or if all characters in s are the same, the output will be 'No'. Otherwise, the output will be 'Yes' followed by a possibly modified version of the input string s (either a randomly shuffled version or a cyclically shifted version of s).
