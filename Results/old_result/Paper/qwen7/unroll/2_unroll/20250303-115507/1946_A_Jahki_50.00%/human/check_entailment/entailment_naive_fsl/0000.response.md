Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program attempts to increment elements until the median increases, but it does not consider the possibility of incrementing elements in a more optimal way. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2 2 8
```

The program outputs `1`, which is correct. However, consider another input:

```
4
7 3 3 1
```

The program outputs `2`, but the correct answer is `1`. Here's why:

- The initial array is `[7, 3, 3, 1]`.
- The sorted array is `[1, 3, 3, 7]`.
- The median is `3` (at index `2`).

To increase the median, we can increment the element at index `2` from `3` to `4`, resulting in the array `[7, 3, 4, 1]`. The sorted array becomes `[1, 3, 4, 7]`, and the new median is `3.5`, which is greater than `3`.

However, the program increments all elements until the median increases, which is not the most efficient approach. The program should focus on incrementing the specific elements needed to achieve the minimum number of operations.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
