Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`num`) and then processing each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Array Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the array (`num2`) is greater than 10000. If so, it prints `1` and `16668` immediately. This is correct because the problem guarantees that the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), and printing `1` and `16668` ensures that the program does not proceed further with large arrays.

3. **Sorting and Median Calculation**: The program sorts the array `a` and calculates the median correctly. It handles both even and odd lengths of the array appropriately. This is correct according to the problem definition.

4. **Incrementing Elements to Increase Median**: The program increments elements starting from the middle index (or indices for even-length arrays) and counts the number of operations needed to make the median strictly greater than its current value. This logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the number of operations required for each test case, which is correct.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
