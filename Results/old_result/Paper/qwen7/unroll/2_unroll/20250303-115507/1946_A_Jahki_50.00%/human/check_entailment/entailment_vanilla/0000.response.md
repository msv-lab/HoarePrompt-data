### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`) and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Array Length Check**:
   - The program checks if `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000. If so, it prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop. This condition seems to be a placeholder or a mistake since the problem description does not mention any such constraint.

3. **Array Construction**:
   - The program constructs the array `a` from the input string and sorts it. This part is correct.

4. **Median Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the median correctly based on whether the length of the array is even or odd. This is done using the formula `ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1` for even lengths and `ma = int(num2 / 2)` for odd lengths.

5. **Operation Counting**:
   - The program attempts to increment elements until the median increases. However, there are several issues with this approach:
     - The program increments elements starting from the middle index (`ma`) and checks if the new median is greater than the old median. This is inefficient and does not guarantee the minimum number of operations.
     - The program does not consider the possibility of increasing other elements to achieve the desired median more efficiently.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of operations required to increase the median. However, the logic used to calculate the number of operations is flawed and does not ensure the minimum number of operations.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
