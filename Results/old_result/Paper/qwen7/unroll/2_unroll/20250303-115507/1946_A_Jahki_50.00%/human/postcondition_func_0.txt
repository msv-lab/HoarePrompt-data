The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the array `a`), and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then sorts the list and calculates the median. If the second largest element is less than or equal to the median, it increments elements until the median is exceeded, counting the number of operations. If `n` is greater than 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 immediately. After processing all test cases, it prints the operation count for each case.
