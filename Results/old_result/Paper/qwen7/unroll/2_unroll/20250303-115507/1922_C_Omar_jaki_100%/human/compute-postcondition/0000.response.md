Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that takes input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string to an integer using the `map` function. However, no actual input is taken or processed in this snippet, so the values of the variables remain unchanged. The lambda function `r` is now available for future use to process input in a similar manner.
