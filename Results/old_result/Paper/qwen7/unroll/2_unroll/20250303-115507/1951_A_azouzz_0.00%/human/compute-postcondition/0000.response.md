Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions that `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `t` with the value of the user's input, while the original variables `start` and `end` retain their initial conditions.
