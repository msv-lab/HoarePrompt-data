Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the value of `n` and `s` will be read from input, and depending on the count of '1's in `s` and whether '11' appears in `s`, the loop will print either 'YES' or 'NO'. The final output state will be a list of these printed values, one for each iteration of the loop.
