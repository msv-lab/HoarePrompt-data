You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing either "Bob" or "Alice", depending on the input values for `a` and `b` in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the line will contain "Bob"; otherwise, it will contain "Alice". The values of `a` and `b` for each iteration are provided as input to the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and prints "Bob" if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, or "Alice" if the absolute difference is odd. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. According to the problem description, the game continues until a player cannot make a valid move. The program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`, which does not account for the sequence of moves and the ability to swap wallets.

For example, consider the test case `(a=1, b=4)`:
- Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 4 coins.
- Alice can choose to swap wallets or not. If she swaps, she gets 4 coins, and Bob gets 1 coin.
- Bob then has the option to swap back or not. If he swaps back, the game state reverts to the original, and Alice can again choose to swap or not.

This example shows that the program does not handle the game logic correctly, as it fails to account for the sequence of moves and the ability to swap wallets dynamically. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
