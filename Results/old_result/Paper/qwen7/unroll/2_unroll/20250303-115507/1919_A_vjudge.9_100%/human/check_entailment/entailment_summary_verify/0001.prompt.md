You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a number `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and prints "Bob" if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, or "Alice" if the absolute difference is odd. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because:
   - If the difference is even, the player whose turn it is can always force the difference to become odd by swapping wallets and removing a coin.
   - If the difference is odd, the player whose turn it is will eventually be left with an even difference, allowing the opponent to force the difference back to odd.

3. **Implementation Check**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
   - If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity of the difference, the program correctly determines the winner according to the game rules.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
