The function processes an array `a` of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It also takes two integers `n` and `k` as input. The function splits the array into two halves, sorts them, and constructs two lists `ans1` and `ans2` by pairing adjacent equal elements from these halves. If `k` is not exhausted, it fills the lists with unique elements from both halves until `k` is used up or the segments are fully processed. Finally, it prints the two lists for each test case.
