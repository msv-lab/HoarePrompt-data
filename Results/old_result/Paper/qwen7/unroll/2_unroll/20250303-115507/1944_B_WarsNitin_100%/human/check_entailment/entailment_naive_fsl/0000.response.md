Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` will be equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. Specifically, the logic for constructing `l` and `r` does not ensure that the required XOR condition is met. Here's an example to illustrate this:

Consider the input:
```
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

The expected output should be two arrays `l` and `r` such that the XOR of their elements is the same. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this. For instance, the solution constructs `l` and `r` by simply taking pairs of elements from the sorted halves of the array, which does not necessarily preserve the required XOR property.

To fix this, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a balanced approach to ensure the XOR values match. One possible way is to use a frequency map to track the XOR values and then construct the arrays accordingly.
