You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, and count is the number of consecutive identical characters in s with the exception that if there is a '01' sequence, it is not counted towards the final count, and flag is a boolean that was used to track the presence of a '01' sequence but is no longer relevant after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It counts the number of consecutive identical characters in `s`, excluding any '01' sequences. For each of the `t` test cases, it prints the count of such sequences.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `count` to 1 and sets a flag `flag` to `False`. This means the initial assumption is that the entire string can be treated as one piece.
2. **Loop through the string**: The loop iterates through the string `s` from index 0 to `len(s) - 2`.
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`, it increments the `count` by 1.
   - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', it sets the flag `flag` to `True` and skips the next character (`j += 1`).
3. **Adjust count based on flag**: After the loop, if the flag `flag` is `True`, it decrements the `count` by 1.
4. **Output the result**: Finally, it prints the `count`.

Let's analyze the logic:

- **Case 1: String with no cuts needed** (e.g., "00000000" or "11111111"):
  - The loop will not find any differences, so `count` remains 1, which is correct.
- **Case 2: String with cuts needed** (e.g., "11010"):
  - The loop will find the difference between '1' and '0' at index 2, incrementing `count` to 2.
  - The flag will be set to `True` when the difference is found, but since we have already incremented `count`, the final `count` will be 3, which is correct.
- **Case 3: Single character strings** (e.g., "1" or "0"):
  - The loop will not execute, and `count` will remain 1, which is correct.
- **Case 4: Strings requiring multiple cuts** (e.g., "10101010"):
  - The loop will find each difference, incrementing `count` for each difference, and the final `count` will be the number of cuts needed.

Given this analysis, the logic in the provided function correctly determines the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description.
