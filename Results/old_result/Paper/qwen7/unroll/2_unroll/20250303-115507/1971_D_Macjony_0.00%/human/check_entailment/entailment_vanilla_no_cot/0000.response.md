Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Counting Cuts**: The logic to count the cuts is flawed. The program increments `count` every time there is a change in consecutive characters. This approach will not always give the minimum number of cuts required.
   
2. **Handling All Zeros Before All Ones**: The program should identify the last position of '0' and the first position of '1'. The number of cuts would then be the number of segments between these positions plus one (if there are any segments).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        n = len(s)
        
        # Find the index of the last '0' and the first '1'
        last_zero = -1
        first_one = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                last_zero = i
            elif s[i] == '1':
                first_one = i
        
        # If there are no zeros or ones, or all zeros or all ones, only one cut is needed
        if last_zero == -1 or first_one == n:
            result = 1
        else:
            # The number of cuts is the number of segments between the last '0' and the first '1'
            result = first_one - last_zero - 1
        
        print(result)

```

This corrected version properly identifies the positions of the last '0' and the first '1' and calculates the minimum number of cuts required.
