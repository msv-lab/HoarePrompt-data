The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. It sorts the digits and letters within the password, checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order and come before any letters, and ensures all characters are either in non-decreasing order or identical. If the password meets these criteria, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
