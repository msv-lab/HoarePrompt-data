### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1(password)`:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   def func_1(password):
       digits = []
       letters = []
       for char in password:
           if char.isdigit():
               digits.append(char)
           else:
               letters.append(char)
   ```
   - This part correctly separates the digits and letters into two lists.

2. **Sorting**:
   ```python
   digits.sort()
   letters.sort()
   ```
   - The digits and letters are sorted individually.

3. **Checking the order of digits**:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(digits)):
       if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
           return False
   ```
   - This ensures that the digits are in non-decreasing order.

4. **Checking the order of letters and digits**:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(digits)):
       if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
           return False
   ```
   - This ensures that the last digit is not greater than any of the letters. However, this check is not sufficient to ensure that all digits are in non-decreasing order relative to each other.

5. **Constructing the sorted password**:
   ```python
   sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
   ```
   - The sorted password is constructed by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.

6. **Final check**:
   ```python
   if (sortedPassword == password):
       return True
   else:
       return False
   ```
   - This ensures that the constructed sorted password matches the original password.

#### Key Points:
- The function correctly sorts the digits and letters.
- It checks if the last digit is not greater than any of the letters.
- However, it does not explicitly check if all digits are in non-decreasing order relative to each other.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case `b123a456`:
  - Digits: `123` and `456`
  - Letters: `b` and `a`
  - Sorted Digits: `123` and `456`
  - Sorted Password: `123456a`
  - The function returns `True` because the last digit `6` is not greater than any of the letters (`a`).

This test case shows that the function does not correctly handle the order of digits. The original assessment is correct in pointing out this issue.

#### Correctness of the Given Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where there are both letters and digits in the password, and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not ensure that all digits are in non-decreasing order relative to each other.
