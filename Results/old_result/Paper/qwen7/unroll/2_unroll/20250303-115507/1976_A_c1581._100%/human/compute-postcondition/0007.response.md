Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs for `len(digits)` iterations, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `len(digits) - 1`.
3. **Initial value of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be `0` because the loop starts iterating from the first index.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `0` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`password`, `digits`, and `letters`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0**
