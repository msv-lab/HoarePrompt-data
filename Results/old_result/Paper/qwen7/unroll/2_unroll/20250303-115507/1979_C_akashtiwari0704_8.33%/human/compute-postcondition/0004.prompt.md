You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list k contains n positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the outer loop. For each line, if the sum of the modified array (where each element is the product of all elements divided by the current element) is greater than or equal to the product of all elements, it will print -1. Otherwise, it will print the modified array elements separated by spaces. The exact values depend on the input provided for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list k contains n positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. It returns different outputs based on the values of t, n, and the list k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
