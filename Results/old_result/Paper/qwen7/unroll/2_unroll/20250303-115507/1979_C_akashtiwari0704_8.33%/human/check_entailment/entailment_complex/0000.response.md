Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the product of all multipliers (`k_i`) and then determining if the sum of the modified multipliers (each being the product divided by the original value) is less than the product. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Modified Multipliers**: The program calculates `a[i] = prod // a[i]` for each `a[i]`, which is not necessarily correct. The requirement is to ensure the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. This means we need to find a distribution of bets such that the sum of the bets is less than the product of the multipliers.

2. **Logic Flaw in Comparison**: The program checks if `sumo >= prod` and prints `-1` if true. This is incorrect because the goal is to ensure the sum of bets is strictly less than the product of multipliers, not greater than or equal to it.

3. **Solution Approach**: The program should find a way to distribute the bets such that the sum of the bets is less than the product of the multipliers. One simple approach is to set each bet to 1, which guarantees the sum of bets will be less than the product of multipliers since each multiplier is at least 2.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
