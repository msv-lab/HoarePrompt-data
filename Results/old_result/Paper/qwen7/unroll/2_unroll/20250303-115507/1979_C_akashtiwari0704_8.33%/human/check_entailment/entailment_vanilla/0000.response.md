### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Bet Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then computes the bet amounts for each outcome by dividing the product by the respective multiplier (`a[i] = prod // a[i]`).
3. **Validation**:
   - It checks if the total bet amount (`sumo`) is less than or equal to the product (`prod`). If so, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - If the total bet amount is less than the product, it constructs and prints the list of bets.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the total bet amount is not less than the product by printing `-1`.
   - The program ensures that the bets are calculated correctly and that the conditions of the problem are met.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
