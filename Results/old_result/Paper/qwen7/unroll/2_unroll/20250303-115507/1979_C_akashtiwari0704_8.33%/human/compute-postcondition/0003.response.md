Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list k contains n positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. It returns different outputs based on the values of t, n, and the list k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases defined by `t`, where each test case includes `n` and a list `k` of integers. The function processes these inputs and returns specific outputs based on the conditions provided.
