Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `ap = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `ap`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
