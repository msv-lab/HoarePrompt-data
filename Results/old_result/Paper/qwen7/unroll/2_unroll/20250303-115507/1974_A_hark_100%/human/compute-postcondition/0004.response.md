Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers between 0 and 99. The function does not return any specific value but rather processes these inputs according to the given constraints.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any direct parameters but seems to handle multiple test cases internally, each involving integers `x` and `y` within specified ranges, and processes them without returning a value directly.
