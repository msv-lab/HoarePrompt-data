Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately calculate the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Mixed Icons**: 
   - The formula `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates how many full 2x2 grids can fit, but the subsequent adjustments (`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`) are incorrect. It incorrectly subtracts and adds values that do not reflect the actual space usage.
   
2. **Handling of Remaining Space**:
   - The program does not properly account for the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons. For example, if there are leftover 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, they should be placed optimally to minimize the number of screens.

3. **Simplistic Approach for Single Type of Icons**:
   - While the logic for handling single types of icons (either all 1x1 or all 2x2) is somewhat correct, the overall approach is overly simplistic and does not cover all edge cases.

### Correct Solution:
A more accurate approach would involve calculating the number of 2x2 icons that can fit and then filling the remaining space with 1x1 icons. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the code:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for _ in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of full 2x2 grids that can fit
        full_grids = min(y, x // 4)
        x -= full_grids * 4
        y -= full_grids * 2
        
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
        screens_needed = math.ceil((x + (y * 2)) / 15)
        
        print(full_grids + screens_needed)

func_1()
```

This solution first calculates the maximum number of full 2x2 grids that can fit, then adjusts the counts of 1x1 and 2x2 icons accordingly. Finally, it calculates the number of additional screens needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons, ensuring the minimum number of screens is used.
