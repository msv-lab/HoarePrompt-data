### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to determine the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` (consisting of only 1 and -1) such that the sorted prefix sums match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- The function `func_1` should correctly implement the dynamic programming solution to count the number of valid sequences.
- The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)` initializes a DP table of size `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
   - `offset = n` sets the offset to `n`.
   - `dp[offset] = 1` initializes the starting point of the DP table.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n` to update the DP table.
   - For each position `i`, the loop updates the `new_dp` table by considering the transitions from `j` to `j+1` and `j-1`.
   - `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` ensure that the transitions are counted correctly.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` calculates the final sum based on the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p` and the offset `n`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1(n, p)` for each test case and stores the results in a list `results`.

2. **Output Printing**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case.

#### Correctness Verification
1. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly models the transitions between prefix sums.
   - The transitions are handled correctly by updating the DP table based on the current state.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like the size of the array and the constraints on the prefix sums.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

3. **Example Handling**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
   - The dynamic programming approach is sound for counting the number of valid sequences.

### Conclusion
After re-analyzing the code and the problem statement, the program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to count the number of valid initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
