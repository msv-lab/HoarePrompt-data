### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding
The goal is to determine the number of initial arrays \(a\) (of size \(n\) consisting of only 1 and -1) such that the sorted prefix sums match the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).

#### Function `func_1`
- **DP Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized to count the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum value.
- **Transition Logic**: For each position `i` in the prefix sum array, the function updates the DP table by considering the previous values. Specifically, if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, it means we can transition from `j` to `j+1` and `j-1` with a probability of `dp[j]`.
- **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, where `offset` is `n`. This is the last value in the prefix sum array after sorting.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Input Reading**: The function reads the input from standard input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
- **Result Collection**: It collects the results of each test case and prints them.

#### Detailed Reasoning
1. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly models the transitions between prefix sums.
   - The DP table `dp` is updated correctly to count the number of valid sequences that can lead to the given sorted prefix sums.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like the size of the array and the constraints on the prefix sums.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
   - The dynamic programming approach is sound for counting the number of valid sequences.

4. **Key Assumption**:
   - The key assumption is that the prefix sums can be constructed in a way that matches the given sorted prefix sums. This assumption is valid because the problem guarantees that the input is consistent with the constraints.

#### Annotated Code Analysis
- **Initial State**: The DP array `dp` is initialized to count the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum value.
- **Transition**: The transitions are correctly modeled, ensuring that the DP table is updated correctly.
- **Final Sum**: The final sum is correctly calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotated code, the program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to count the number of valid initial arrays \(a\) that result in the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
