Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is 1, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was assigned from `int(data[index])` before the increment, and the assignment does not get executed again here. Therefore, `t` is still an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`.
