### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the binomial coefficients \(C(n, i)\) using dynamic programming.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` with a length of \(2n + 1\) and sets the middle index (`offset`) to `n`.
   - It iterates through the prefix sums `p` and updates the DP array based on the current and previous values.
   - Finally, it returns the binomial coefficient corresponding to the last element of `p` plus the offset.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, the size of the hidden array `n`, and the sorted prefix sums `p` for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results in a list.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the binomial coefficient \(C(n, i)\) where \(i\) is derived from the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and ensures that the results are printed in the correct format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
   - The use of modulo \(998244353\) prevents overflow issues.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent errors in the implementation.

### Correctness:
