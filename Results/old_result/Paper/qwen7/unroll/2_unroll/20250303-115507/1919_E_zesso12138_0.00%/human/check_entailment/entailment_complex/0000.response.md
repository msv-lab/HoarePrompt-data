### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \).
   - The state transition involves updating a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j`.
   - The function correctly initializes the DP array and updates it based on the previous values, ensuring that the final result is calculated modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input for each test case, extracts the necessary parameters `n` and `p`, and calls `func_1(n, p)` to get the result.
   - The results are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases, reads the necessary inputs, and processes them according to the problem statement.
   - The logic for calculating the binomial coefficient and handling the prefix sums is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
