#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.

    #State: Output State: `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element is equal to the binomial coefficient C(n, i) for i ranging from 0 to 2 * n, and `MOD` is the modulus used during the calculations to prevent overflow. The list starts from index 0 up to index 2 * n.

    #The program returns the binomial coefficient C(n, final_sum), where final_sum is equal to p[-1] + offset and MOD is the modulus used during the calculations to prevent overflow.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 5000) and `p` (a sorted list of integers). It calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, final_sum), where `final_sum` is the last element of the list `p` plus an offset (`n`). The calculation is done using dynamic programming and a modulus (`MOD`) is applied to prevent overflow. The function returns the computed binomial coefficient.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a for each test case, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order for each test case.

    #State: Output State: `index` is 6, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop. The length of `results` is equal to `t`. The value of `data[index]` is not specified in the loop and remains unchanged, and `data` itself is not modified by the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (size of the hidden array `a`), and a list `p` of `n` integers. It then calls another function `func_1(n, p)` for each test case to compute some result, stores these results in a list `results`, and finally prints each result. The function does not return any value but modifies the `results` list and prints the computed results.
