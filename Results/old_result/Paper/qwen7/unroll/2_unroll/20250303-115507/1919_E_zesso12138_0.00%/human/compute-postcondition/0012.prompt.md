You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a for each test case, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 6, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop. The length of `results` is equal to `t`. The value of `data[index]` is not specified in the loop and remains unchanged, and `data` itself is not modified by the loop.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: index
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases through a loop or similar construct, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` (representing the number of test cases), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array `a`), and a list `p` of `n` integers (where |p_i| ≤ n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order). For each test case, it does not return anything explicitly but processes the given data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
