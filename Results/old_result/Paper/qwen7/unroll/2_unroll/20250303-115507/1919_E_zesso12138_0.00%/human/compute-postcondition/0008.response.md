Output State: `index` is 6, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop. The length of `results` is equal to `t`. The value of `data[index]` is not specified in the loop and remains unchanged, and `data` itself is not modified by the loop.
