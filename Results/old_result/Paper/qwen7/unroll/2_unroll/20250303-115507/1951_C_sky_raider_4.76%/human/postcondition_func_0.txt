The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( c \) using a specific formula involving the sorted list \( a \) and the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). The final value of \( c \) is printed for each test case.
