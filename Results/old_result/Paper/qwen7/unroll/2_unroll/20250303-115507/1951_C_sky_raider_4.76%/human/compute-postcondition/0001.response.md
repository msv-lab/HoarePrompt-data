Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. After executing the loop, c is a float representing the sum of the expression \(l[i] \times s - \frac{s \times s}{2}\) for each element in the sorted list l, where \(s = \min(m, k)\) and k is decremented by s after each iteration.
