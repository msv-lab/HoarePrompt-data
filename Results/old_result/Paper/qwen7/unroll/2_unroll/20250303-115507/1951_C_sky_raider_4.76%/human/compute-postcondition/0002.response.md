Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. After executing the loop, c is a float calculated based on the given formula: `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` where `s = min(m, k)` and `k -= s` for each iteration of the inner loop.
