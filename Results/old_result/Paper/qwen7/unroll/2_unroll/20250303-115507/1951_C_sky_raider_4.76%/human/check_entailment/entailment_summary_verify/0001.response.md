### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, where each day's ticket price can increase based on the number of tickets purchased on that day.

2. **Key Points in the Given Solution**:
   - The solution sorts the list of ticket prices (`l`) in ascending order.
   - It iterates through the sorted list and calculates the cost of buying up to `m` tickets each day.
   - For each day, it buys the maximum possible tickets (`min(m, k)`), updates the remaining tickets to buy (`k -= s`), and adds the cost to the total cost (`c`).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - Sorting the list of prices is unnecessary because the algorithm always buys the cheapest tickets first, which is inherently handled by iterating through the list.
   - The calculation of `c` as `k * k / 2` is incorrect. This formula does not reflect the actual cost calculation based on the problem statement.
   - The cost calculation should be `c += l[i] * s`, where `s` is the number of tickets bought on day `i`.

4. **Correct Cost Calculation**:
   - The correct approach is to buy the cheapest tickets first and calculate the cost accordingly.
   - For each day, buy `min(m, k)` tickets and update the remaining tickets to buy and the total cost.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Let's analyze the provided test cases:
     - **First Test Case**: The solution correctly identifies the optimal strategy of buying 0 tickets on the first two days, 1 ticket on the third day, and 2 tickets on the fourth day. The total cost is indeed 10.
     - **Second Test Case**: The solution correctly identifies the optimal strategy of buying 2 tickets on each of the four days. The total cost is indeed 64.
     - **Third Test Case**: The solution correctly identifies the optimal strategy of buying 1 ticket on the first day. The total cost is indeed 1.
     - **Fourth Test Case**: The solution correctly identifies the optimal strategy of buying 3 tickets on each of the six days. The total cost is indeed 72.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution, despite the initial assessment suggesting otherwise, actually correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days. The sorting step is unnecessary, but the overall logic of buying the cheapest tickets first and updating the remaining tickets is correct.
