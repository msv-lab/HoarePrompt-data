Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + 1, y, x2, y2], where n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, x2 is greater than x1, the difference (x2 - x1) is odd, and y is y2 - 1. Additionally, y1 is not equal to y2. In the if part, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `a` is set to `y2 - 1`. In the else part, if `y1` is less than `y2`, then `a` is set to `m - y2`.**
