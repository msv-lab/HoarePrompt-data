Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2], where n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and (x2 - x1) % 2 == 0, and y1 is not equal to y2; `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.**

Explanation: The code `b = x2 - x1` calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0` is still valid, and `y1` is not equal to `y2` remains true.
