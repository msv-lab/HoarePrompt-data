You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) to determine if player Alice or Bob wins based on certain conditions. The function reads six integers from input representing the number of test cases, grid dimensions (n, m), and coordinates of two points. It then checks several conditions involving the coordinates and prints either "Alice", "Bob", or "draw" based on these conditions. If the conditions are met, it may adjust the coordinates and return a modified list of coordinates or the absolute difference between y-coordinates. Otherwise, it returns None.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly parses the input using `list(map(int, input().split()))` which converts the input into a list of integers. This is necessary for further processing.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints "draw" immediately. This is correct because if Bob is on or above Alice, Alice cannot win since she can only move down or diagonally down.

3. **Odd Difference Check**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, the program proceeds to check if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if Alice and Bob are on the same column, Alice can always move down to the same row as Bob and win.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the program attempts to move Alice closer to Bob. However, this part of the logic is flawed. Specifically, the logic to adjust `y1` and `x1` does not account for all possible moves and outcomes correctly.

4. **Even Difference Check**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, the program again checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Alice and Bob are on the same column, Bob can always move up to the same row as Alice and win.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the program attempts to move Alice and Bob closer to each other. Again, the logic to adjust `y1`, `y2`, and `x1`, `x2` does not cover all scenarios correctly.

5. **Final Outcome Determination**:
   - The program uses a series of conditions to determine if Alice or Bob can force a win. However, the logic used to determine these conditions is overly complex and does not fully account for all possible game states. For example, it does not handle all edge cases where Alice or Bob might be forced into a position where they cannot win.

### Conclusion:
The program contains several logical errors and does not fully implement the optimal strategy for determining the game outcome. Therefore, it is not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
