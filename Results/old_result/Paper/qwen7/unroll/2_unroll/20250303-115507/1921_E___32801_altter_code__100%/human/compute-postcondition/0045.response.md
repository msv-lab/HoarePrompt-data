Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, y, x2 - a, m-1], `b` is the value of (x2 - a) - x1, where x2 - a is greater than x1, the difference ((x2 - a) - x1) is even, and y is m-1 - 1 = m-2; `y1` is increased by `a`, and the condition (x2 > x1 and x1 ≥ 1 and x2 ≤ n) holds.**

Explanation: The variable `y1` is incremented by `a`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state. The condition (x2 > x1 and x1 ≥ 1 and x2 ≤ n) still holds true.
