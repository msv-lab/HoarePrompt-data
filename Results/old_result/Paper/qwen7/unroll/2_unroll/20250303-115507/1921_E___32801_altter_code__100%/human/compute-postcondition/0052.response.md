Output State: **The program returns a value of `t` which is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y2` is greater than `y1`, otherwise it returns the absolute value of `1 - y1`.**

Given the conditions:
- `y` is either `y2 - 1` or `0`, depending on whether `y2` is less than or equal to `y1` or not.
- If `y2 <= y1`, then `y` is `0` and `t` is equal to the absolute value of `1 - y1`.
- If `y2 > y1`, then `y` is `y2 - 1` and `t` is equal to the absolute value of `y2 - y1`.

Since there is no specific value given for `y1` and `y2`, the output depends on their relative values. However, the return statement itself does not specify any calculation or assignment; it simply returns `t`. Therefore, the exact value of `t` is determined by the conditions described.
