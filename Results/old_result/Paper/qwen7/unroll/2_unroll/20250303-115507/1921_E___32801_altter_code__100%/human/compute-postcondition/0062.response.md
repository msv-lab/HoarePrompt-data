Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2], where n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and (x2 - x1) % 2 == 0, and y1 is not equal to y2, and the current value of y2 is greater than or equal to y1**
