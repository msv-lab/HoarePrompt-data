Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, y, x2 - a, y2], `b` is the value of (x2 - a) - x1, where the difference ((x2 - a) - x1) is even, and y is y2 - 1; `t` is equal to the absolute value of y2 - y1, and the condition (x2 > x1 and x1 ≥ 1 and x2 ≤ n) holds. If `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, then `y` is set to 0 and `y1` is adjusted accordingly (decreased by `a` if `y2` was originally greater than `y1`, or increased by `a` if `y2` was originally less than `y1`). Otherwise, `y` is set to `m-2` and `y1` remains unchanged.
