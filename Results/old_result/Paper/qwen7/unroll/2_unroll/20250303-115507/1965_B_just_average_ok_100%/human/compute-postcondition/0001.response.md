Output State: The number of elements in the list `nums` after processing each test case, followed by the elements in `nums`. For each test case, `nums` will contain 5 elements: `[k-nums[idx], k+1, k+nums[idx]+1, (1<<idx), (1<<(idx+1))]`, where `idx` is the index just before the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`. The specific values of these elements depend on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
