Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to construct a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - All integers from 1 to \(n\) (except \(k\)) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Annotated Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and adjusts the list accordingly.
   - It appends specific values to ensure the required properties are met:
     - \(k - 2^j\) (where \(2^j\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\)).
     - \(k + 1\).
     - \(k + 2^j + 1\).
     - Removes one element based on the value of \(k\).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The constructed sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\) because the specific adjustments made prevent any combination from reaching exactly \(k\).
   - All integers from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) can be formed as subsequence sums due to the inclusion of necessary values like \(k - 2^j\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^j + 1\).

Given the logic and the steps taken in the annotated program, it appears the program correctly constructs the required sequence for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
