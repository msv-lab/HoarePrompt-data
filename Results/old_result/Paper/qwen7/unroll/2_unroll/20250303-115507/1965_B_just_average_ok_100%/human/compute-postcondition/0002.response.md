Output State: The number of elements in the list `nums` after processing each test case, followed by the elements in the list `nums`. The list `nums` will contain up to 24 unique elements, which are derived from the value of `k` and the fixed values \(1 \ll i\) for \(i\) in range(21). The exact elements in `nums` depend on the value of `k` for each test case, but it will always include \(k\), \(k-2^j\) where \(2^j\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\), \(k+1\), and \(k+2^j+1\), with one element removed based on the value of `k`.
