Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line representing the value of `num` printed after processing each iteration of the outer loop. Each value of `num` is calculated based on the logic inside the loops, considering the inputs provided for `innerLoop`. The exact values depend on the specific inputs given during the execution of the inner loops.
