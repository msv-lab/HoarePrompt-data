t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
