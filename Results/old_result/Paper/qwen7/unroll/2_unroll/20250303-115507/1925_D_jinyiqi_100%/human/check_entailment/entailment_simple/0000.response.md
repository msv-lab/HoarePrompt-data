Reasoning:

The given program aims to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions, and then compute \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9+7) \).

Let's break down the key steps and logic in the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
2. **Summing Friendship Values**: For each test case, it sums up the friendship values \( f_i \) for all given pairs.
3. **Calculating Expected Value**: 
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion is derived from the probability of picking a friend pair and the effect on future picks.
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]
   - Here, \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the total number of ways to pick any two children out of \( n \).
4. **GCD Calculation**: The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( p \) and \( q \) to simplify the fraction.
5. **Modular Inverse**: Finally, it computes \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9+7) \).

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic seems correct. The program correctly handles the input constraints and performs the necessary calculations to find the expected value and the required modular inverse.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
