### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen.
- The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f = 0
        for j in range(m):
            (a, b, f) = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
        q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        p = p // gcd
        q = q // gcd
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates a value based on the sum of \(f_i\) values, the number of people \(n\), and the number of friendships \(m\).
- It then computes and prints the result of a mathematical expression involving these values and a modulus operation.

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**: The program correctly sums up the friendship values \(f_i\) for all pairs of friends.
2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The program correctly uses modular inverse to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
3. **GCD Calculation**: The program correctly simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) using the greatest common divisor (GCD).

However, the key issue lies in the formula used to compute \(p\) and \(q\). Let's break down the correct approach:

- **Expected Value Calculation**: For each pair of friends, the expected number of times they are chosen in \(k\) excursions is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\). Since the friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion, the expected increase in friendship value for each pair is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- **Total Expected Value**: The total expected value is the sum of the expected increases for all pairs of friends.

Given the formula in the original program:
\[ p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \]

This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the expected number of times each pair is chosen and the resulting increase in friendship values.

The correct approach should be:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot f_i \right) \]

Given the complexity and the need for a more precise calculation, the original program's formula is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The original assessment was accurate.
