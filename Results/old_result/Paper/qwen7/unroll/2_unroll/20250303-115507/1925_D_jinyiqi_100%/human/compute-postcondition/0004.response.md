Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the result of the expression `(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` for each iteration of the outer loop. Each result is calculated based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for that specific iteration, along with the cumulative sum of `f` values from the inner loop, modulo `M` (1000000007).
