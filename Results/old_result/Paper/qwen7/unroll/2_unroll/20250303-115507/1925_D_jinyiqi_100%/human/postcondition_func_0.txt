The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with additional pairs of integers \( a_i \), \( b_i \), and \( f_i \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the sum of \( f_i \) values, the number of people \( n \), and the number of friendships \( m \), then computes and prints the result of a mathematical expression involving these values and a modulus operation. The final output consists of one integer per test case, representing the computed result for each case.
