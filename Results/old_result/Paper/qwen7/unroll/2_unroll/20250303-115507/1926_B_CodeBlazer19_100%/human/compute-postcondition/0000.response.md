Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 remains valid, but now `t` specifically holds the value entered by the user. All other conditions and preconditions remain unchanged.
