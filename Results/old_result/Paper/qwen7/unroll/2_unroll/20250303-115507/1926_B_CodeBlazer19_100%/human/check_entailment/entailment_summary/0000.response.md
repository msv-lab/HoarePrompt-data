Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires identifying whether a given grid represents a triangle or a square formed by '1's.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and the grid itself.
   - The logic within the loop to determine the shape is flawed:
     - `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if any row contains exactly one '1'.
     - `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'.
     - However, this approach is incorrect because:
       - It only checks the first row that meets the condition, which might not represent the entire shape.
       - It doesn't check if the entire grid forms a consistent triangle or square.
3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The program attempts to identify the shape based on the presence of rows with specific patterns of '1's.
   - However, the current implementation does not correctly identify the shapes due to the flawed logic.
4. **Correctness**:
   - Given the flawed logic, the program will not accurately determine the shape for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
