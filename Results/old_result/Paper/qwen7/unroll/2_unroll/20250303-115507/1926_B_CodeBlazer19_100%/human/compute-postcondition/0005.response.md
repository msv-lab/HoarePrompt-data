Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a grid represented as a list of strings. Each string contains binary characters ('0' or '1'). The function determines whether the grid contains a triangle or a square that includes all the '1's and prints 'TRIANGLE' if a triangle is found, otherwise it prints 'SQUARE'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
