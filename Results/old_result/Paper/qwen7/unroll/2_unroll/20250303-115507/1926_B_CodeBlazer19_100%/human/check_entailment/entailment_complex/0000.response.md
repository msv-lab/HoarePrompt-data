Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking each row of the grid to determine if it contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangles**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' and immediately assumes the shape is a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have more than one row with exactly one '1' (as shown in the example where `k=3`). The program should check for the pattern of a triangle across multiple rows, not just a single row.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Squares**: The program checks if any row contains more than one '1' and immediately assumes the shape is a square. This is also incorrect because a square can have rows with more than one '1' but still be a square (as shown in the example where `k=4`). The program should check for the pattern of a square across multiple rows, not just a single row.

3. **Incomplete Logic**: The program does not properly handle the logic to identify both triangles and squares. It only checks for one condition per row and does not consider the overall structure of the grid.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly identify the shapes in the grid.

Correctness: **False**
