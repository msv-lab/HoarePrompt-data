Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads the input as specified in the problem statement.
2. It correctly initializes the necessary variables and calls the `func_1` function with the appropriate parameters.
3. In `func_1`, the program iterates over the commands and appends the corresponding elements from the array to the list `b`. However, there is a mistake here: the program should calculate the product of the remaining elements of the array after each command, not just append the current element being processed.
4. The product calculation part (`ans = []` and the loop inside `func_1`) is incorrect because it does not account for the removal of elements from the array and only considers the elements in the list `b`.
5. The final result is returned in reverse order, which is not required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the array and the calculation of the product modulo `m`.

Correctness: **False**
