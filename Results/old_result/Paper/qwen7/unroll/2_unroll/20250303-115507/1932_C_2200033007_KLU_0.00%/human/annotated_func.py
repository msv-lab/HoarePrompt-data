#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list where elements are appended based on the direction specified in `s`, `r` is -1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes, `l` remains 0 because it only increments when 'L' is encountered, and `r` is set to -1 after decrementing `n-1` times. The list `b` will contain elements from `a` either from the left or right based on the directions specified in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list where elements are the reverse product of the elements in `b` starting from the last element, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element, `p` is not defined since it goes out of scope after the loop.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. Then, it calculates a reversed list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element. Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.
