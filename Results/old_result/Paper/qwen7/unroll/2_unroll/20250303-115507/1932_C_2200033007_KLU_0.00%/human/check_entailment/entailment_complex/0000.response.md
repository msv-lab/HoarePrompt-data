Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1`.
2. The function `func_1` processes the commands in the string `s` and appends the appropriate elements from the list `a` to the list `b`.
3. After constructing the list `b`, the function calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and stores these products in the list `ans`.
4. However, there is a critical issue with the function's logic. The function should calculate the product of the elements in `a` as specified by the commands in `s` and then take the modulus with `m` at each step. Instead, the function constructs a list `b` which is not used correctly for the product calculation.
5. The function should directly compute the product of the elements in `a` as per the commands and take the modulus with `m` at each step, rather than constructing an intermediate list `b`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function does not correctly implement the required logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
