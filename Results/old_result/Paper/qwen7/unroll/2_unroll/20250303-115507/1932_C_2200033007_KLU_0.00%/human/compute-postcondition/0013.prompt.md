You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list where elements are appended based on the direction specified in `s`, `r` is -1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes, `l` remains 0 because it only increments when 'L' is encountered, and `r` is set to -1 after decrementing `n-1` times. The list `b` will contain elements from `a` either from the left or right based on the directions specified in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list where elements are the reverse product of the elements in `b` starting from the last element, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element, `p` is not defined since it goes out of scope after the loop.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a reversed list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
