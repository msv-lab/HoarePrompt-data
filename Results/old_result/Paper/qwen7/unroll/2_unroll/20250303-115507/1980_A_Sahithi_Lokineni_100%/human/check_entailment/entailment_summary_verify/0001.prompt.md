You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    d['A'] = 0
    d['B'] = 0
    d['C'] = 0
    d['D'] = 0
    d['E'] = 0
    d['F'] = 0
    d['G'] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] <= m:
            ans = ans + m - d[val]
    print(ans)

def func_1():
    return 0



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts no parameters and always returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a while loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is correct.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes a dictionary `d` using `defaultdict`, but it does not specify what `default_value` is. This will lead to an error because `default_value` is not defined. It should be initialized with `defaultdict(int)` instead, which will handle missing keys by defaulting their values to 0.

3. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m` for each test case. It also reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

4. **Counting Problems**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s` and stores them in the dictionary `d`.

5. **Calculating Missing Problems**: The program calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. For each difficulty level, if the count in the dictionary is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to the answer. This logic is correct.

6. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case, which is correct.

However, the main issue is the undefined `default_value`. If we assume `default_value` was meant to be `int`, the program would work as intended. Without this assumption, the program will raise an error.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but it will fail due to the undefined `default_value`. Assuming `default_value` is `int`, the program works as intended.
