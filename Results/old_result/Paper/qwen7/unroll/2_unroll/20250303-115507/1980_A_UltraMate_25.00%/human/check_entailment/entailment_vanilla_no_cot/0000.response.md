Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. The program incorrectly calculates the number of problems needed for each difficulty level.
2. The program assumes that only the difficulties 'A' to 'F' need to be considered, but it should also consider 'G'.
3. The logic for calculating the additional problems needed is flawed. It should ensure that for each round, all seven difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') are covered.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        # Check if we have at least one problem of each difficulty level
        for i in 'ABCDEFG':
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        # If there are fewer than m problems for any difficulty level, calculate the additional problems needed
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all seven difficulty levels are considered and calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed correctly.
