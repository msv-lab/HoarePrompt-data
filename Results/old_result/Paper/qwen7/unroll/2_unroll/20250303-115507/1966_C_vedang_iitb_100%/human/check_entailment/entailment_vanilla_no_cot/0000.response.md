Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the game logic. The key issue lies in how the game state is being analyzed. The solution calculates the minimum excluded value (`mexsize`) but does not correctly apply the game rules to determine the winner.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). The player who faces a Nim-sum of zero after their move will lose if both players play optimally. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for sz in a:
            nim_sum ^= sz
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print("Bob")
        else:
            print("Alice")

func()
```

This version correctly computes the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
