Reasoning:
The given function does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function calculates the number of operations required to sort the binary string in non-descending order by counting the number of inversions between '0' and '1'. However, the problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make the string sorted using cyclic shifts of substrings.

The function `func_1` does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string and converts it to a list of integers.
3. It counts the number of zeros in the string.
4. It iterates through the string and calculates a value `ans` based on the counts of zeros and ones encountered so far.

This approach does not account for the cost associated with performing cyclic shifts or the optimal way to sort the string using these shifts. The given solution is incorrect because it does not implement the logic to find the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.

Correctness: **False**
