Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1` and decremented by 1 until it reaches -1.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `i` must be at least 0 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is non-negative.
   - The length of `num` (denoted as `len(num)`) must be at least 1 because if `num` were empty (`len(num) = 0`), `i` would start from -1, and the loop would not execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num` should be a non-empty string (i.e., its length should be at least 1).
- `i` should be initialized to a value that is at least 0.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:
State: **`num` is a non-empty string, `i` is initialized to a value that is at least 0**
