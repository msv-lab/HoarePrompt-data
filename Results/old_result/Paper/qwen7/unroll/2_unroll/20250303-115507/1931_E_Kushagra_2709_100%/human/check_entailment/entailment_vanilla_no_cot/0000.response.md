Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Length**: The function `func_1` calculates the total length of the numbers by converting each number to a string and summing their lengths. However, the logic for updating `tot` is flawed. It subtracts the zero counts of the largest numbers, which does not correctly simulate the game rules.

2. **Zero Count Calculation**: The function `zerocnts` calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number. This is not directly relevant to the game rules described. The game involves reversing digits and concatenating numbers, not counting zeros.

3. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The game logic requires simulating the turns of Anna and Sasha to determine the winner. The current implementation does not properly simulate the game turns or check the conditions under which Sasha wins.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game turns and determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players. Here is a more appropriate approach:

```python
def game_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, m, nums in test_cases:
        # Simulate the game
        while len(nums) > 1:
            # Anna's turn: Reverse a number
            if len(nums) == 2:
                # If only two numbers left, Sasha can always concatenate them to win
                results.append("Sasha")
                break
            a = max(nums)
            nums.remove(a)
            b = min(nums)
            nums.remove(b)
            nums.append(int(f"{a}{b}"))
        
        # Check if Sasha wins
        if len(nums) == 1 and int(nums[0]) >= 10**m:
            results.append("Sasha")
        else:
            results.append("Anna")
    
    return results

# Example usage
t = 9
test_cases = [
    (2, 2, [14, 2]),
    (3, 5, [9, 56, 1]),
    (4, 10, [1, 2007, 800, 1580]),
    (4, 5, [5000, 123, 30, 4]),
    (10, 10, [6, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 10, 9, 10, 7]),
    (1, 1, [6]),
    (1, 1, [10]),
    (8, 9, [1, 2, 9, 10, 10, 2, 10, 2]),
    (4, 5, [10, 10, 10, 10])
]

results = game_winner(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This approach simulates the game turns and checks the final condition to determine the winner.
