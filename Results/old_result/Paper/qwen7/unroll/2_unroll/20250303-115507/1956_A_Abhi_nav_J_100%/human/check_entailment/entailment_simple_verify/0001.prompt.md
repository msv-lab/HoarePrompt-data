You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100. b is a list of q integers representing the number of players initially joining the game where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ q.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list containing each element of the original list a minus 1.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list 'b' which contains q integers representing the number of players initially joining the game, where each integer n_i satisfies 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, and then the sequence `a` and the list of initial player counts `n_i`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is defined to calculate the number of players remaining after the first round.
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect for determining the number of winners. Specifically:
     - If `a <= b`, it returns `a - 1`. This logic does not account for the sequence of players being removed and the subsequent rounds.
     - If `a > b`, it returns `b`. This also does not correctly simulate the removal of players based on the sequence.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over each value of `n_i` and calls `func_1` with `int(k_wali_list[0])` and `int(q_wali_list[j])`.
   - Since `k_wali_list[0]` is always the same (the first element of the sequence `a`), the function call is always using the same value for `a`, which is incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly determine the number of winners, we need to simulate the rounds of the game until no more players can be removed.
   - We need to keep track of the current list of players and remove the players at positions specified by the sequence `a` in each round.
   - The function should return the number of players remaining after all rounds have been processed.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it uses a flawed function `func_1` that does not simulate the game correctly. It does not account for the sequence of removing players and does not handle multiple rounds of the game.

### Correctness:
**False**
