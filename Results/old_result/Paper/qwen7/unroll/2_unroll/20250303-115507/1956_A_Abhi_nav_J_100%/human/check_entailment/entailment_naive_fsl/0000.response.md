Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the logic of the game as intended. According to the problem, in each round, players at positions specified by the sequence `a` are removed from the game. The function `func_1` simply returns the minimum of `a` and `b`, which does not simulate the removal process correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- For `k = 2`, `a = [3, 5]`, and `n = 5`, the expected output should be `2` because players at positions 3 and 5 are removed in the first round, and then player 3 is removed again in the second round, leaving players 1 and 2 as winners.
- However, the current implementation of `func_1` will not correctly simulate this process. It will always return the value of `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, or `b` otherwise, which is not the intended behavior.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and hence is incorrect.
