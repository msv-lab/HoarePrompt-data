Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the required modular values and does not properly account for the conditions \(a_i + a_j\) being divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) being divisible by \(y\).

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs `0` because it incorrectly calculates the required modular values. For example, for the pair \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\):

- \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_5 = 9\)
- \(a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10\) (which is divisible by 5)
- \(a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8\) (which is divisible by 2)

But the program does not correctly identify this pair as beautiful due to its flawed logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
