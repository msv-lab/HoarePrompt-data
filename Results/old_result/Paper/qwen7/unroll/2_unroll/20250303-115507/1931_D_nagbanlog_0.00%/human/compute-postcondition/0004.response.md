Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer; and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y), representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. The function returns a list 'results' containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.**
