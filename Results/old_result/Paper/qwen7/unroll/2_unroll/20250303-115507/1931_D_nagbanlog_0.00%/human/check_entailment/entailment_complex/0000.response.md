Reasoning:
1. The problem requires counting the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on specific conditions involving two integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. The annotated program correctly follows the logic to identify and count these pairs:
   - It initializes a frequency dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each pair of remainders when the array elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders to form a beautiful pair and checks if those remainders exist in the frequency dictionary.
   - If they do, it adds the count from the dictionary to the `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current element's remainders.
3. The program prints intermediate steps which help in understanding the logic but are not necessary for the final result.
4. The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
