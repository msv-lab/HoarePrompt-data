Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer (though it is not used in the function), and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `(n, x, y)` representing the size of an array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array. The function processes each test case to count the number of "beautiful pairs" based on specific conditions and returns a list of these counts for each test case. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices `(i, j)` in the array such that the numbers at these indices satisfy certain modular conditions related to `x` and `y`.**
