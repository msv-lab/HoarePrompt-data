### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks.
   - Each polygon must have all sides equal (i.e., regular), and no stick can be used more than once.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and their lengths stored in `palka`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is created to store unique stick lengths.
   - The variable `shapes` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the number of polygons that can be formed.
   - For each unique stick length in `pl`, if its count in `d` is at least 3, it increments `shapes`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length.
   - However, the code does not ensure that the number of sticks for each polygon is sufficient to form a polygon with at least 3 sides.
   - The code simply checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length without considering the total number of such sticks available.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     1
     1
     2
     1 1
     6
     2 2 3 3 3 3
     9
     4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
     ```
   - The output should be:
     ```
     0
     0
     1
     2
     ```
   - The current implementation will output:
     ```
     0
     0
     1
     1
     ```
   - This is incorrect because in the last test case, we can form 2 polygons (one with side length 2 and another with side length 4).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code does not correctly calculate the maximum number of polygons that can be formed simultaneously.
   - It only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length without ensuring that the total number of such sticks is sufficient to form multiple polygons.

### Correctness:
**False**
