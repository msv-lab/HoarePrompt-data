Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, along with stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` which are integers between 1 and 100. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
