Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, w is the number of iterations of the loop, each iteration processes a line (ln) and a list of integers (palka), counts the occurrences of each integer in palka where an occurrence count of 3 or more increments the 'shapes' counter, and prints the total 'shapes' count after processing all lines.
