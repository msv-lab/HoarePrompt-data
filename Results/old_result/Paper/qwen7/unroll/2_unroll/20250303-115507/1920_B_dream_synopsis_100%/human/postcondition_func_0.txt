The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` in descending order, calculates a series of sums based on specified conditions involving `k` and `x`, stores these sums in a list `ans`, and finally prints the maximum value from `ans` for each test case.
