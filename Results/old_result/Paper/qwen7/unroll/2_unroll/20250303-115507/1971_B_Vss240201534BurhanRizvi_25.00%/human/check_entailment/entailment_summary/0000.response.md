Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating a random permutation of the input string `s` and checking if it is different from the original string. This approach works correctly under the following conditions:

1. **String Length**: The program handles strings of length up to 10, which is within the specified constraints.
2. **Random Permutation**: Using `random.sample(s, len(s))` ensures that the generated string `s2` is a permutation of the original string `s`.
3. **Comparison**: The program correctly checks if the original string `s` is different from the shuffled string `s2`. If they are different, it prints 'Yes' followed by the shuffled string; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Given these points, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
