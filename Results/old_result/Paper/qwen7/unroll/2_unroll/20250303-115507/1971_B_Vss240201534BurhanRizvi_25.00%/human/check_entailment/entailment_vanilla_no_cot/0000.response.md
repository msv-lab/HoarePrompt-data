Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by generating a random rearrangement of the input string `s` using `random.sample`. If the generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`. If the generated string `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No". This approach is correct for the given problem constraints and examples provided.
