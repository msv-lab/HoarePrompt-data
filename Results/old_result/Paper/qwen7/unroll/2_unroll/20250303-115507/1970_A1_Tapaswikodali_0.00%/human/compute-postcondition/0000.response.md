Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, the value of `s` is updated to the input string provided by the user, while maintaining the properties of being a non-empty string of balanced parentheses.
