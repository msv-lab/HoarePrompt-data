### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function correctly initializes `t` as the number of test cases.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store results for each test case.
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the constraints of type 1 and type 2 respectively.
   - `cx` is a set to handle the constraints of type 3.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It processes each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, it correctly checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If true, it means no integer `k` can satisfy all constraints, so it appends `0` to `r`.

4. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If `bx < ax`, it correctly counts the number of integers in `cx` that lie between `bx` and `ax`.
   - The number of valid integers `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of integers in `cx` that lie within `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it correctly prints the results for each test case.

However, there is a potential issue with the initialization of `ax` and `bx`. Specifically, `ax` is initialized to `int(1000000000.0 + 7)`, which is `1000000007`. This is an arbitrary large number and might not always be appropriate. Given the constraints `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9`, initializing `ax` to `1000000007` ensures that any valid `x` will be smaller, but it is not necessary and could potentially lead to confusion.

To ensure correctness, we should initialize `ax` to a value that is clearly outside the range of possible `x` values, such as `-1` (as done in the code). This ensures that any valid `x` will update `ax` appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is mostly correct, but there is a minor issue with the initialization of `ax`. The logic and overall approach are sound, and the program correctly handles all specified cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
