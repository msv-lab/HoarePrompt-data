Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints. Specifically, the program does not check if the range defined by the constraints is empty. In the second test case provided in the example, the constraints are \( k \geq 5 \) and \( k \leq 4 \), which is impossible. The program does not account for this scenario and instead calculates the difference between `ax` and `bx`, leading to an incorrect result of 0. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle cases where no valid \( k \) exists.
