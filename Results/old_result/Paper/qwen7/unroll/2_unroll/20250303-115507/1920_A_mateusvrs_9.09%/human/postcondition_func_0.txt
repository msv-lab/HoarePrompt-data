The function reads a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` followed by `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. For each pair, it updates variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` based on the value of `a`. After processing all pairs for each test case, it calculates a result based on the values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` and appends this result to a list `r`. Finally, it prints the list `r` containing the calculated results for each test case.
