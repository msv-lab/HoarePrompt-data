Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
- `r` is a list containing up to `t` integers, where each integer is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop.

However, the code snippet provided does not include the loop or any specific calculation for the integers in the list `r`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of the integers in the list `r`.

Given this, the output will consist of the integers in the list `r`, each on a new line, but since we do not know the exact values, we can only describe them in general terms.

Output: **the integers in the list r, each on a new line**
