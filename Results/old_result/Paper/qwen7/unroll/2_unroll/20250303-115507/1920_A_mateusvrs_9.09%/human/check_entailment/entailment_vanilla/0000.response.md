### Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `t` as the number of test cases. It also initializes an empty list `r` to store results for each test case. Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the constraints of type 1 and type 2 respectively. `cx` is a set to handle the constraints of type 3.

2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`. Then, it processes each constraint:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**: After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If true, it means no integer `k` can satisfy all constraints, so it appends `0` to `r`.

4. **Counting Valid Integers**: If `bx < ax`, it counts the number of integers in `cx` that lie between `bx` and `ax`. The number of valid integers `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of integers in `cx` that lie within `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly handles all specified cases and guarantees that the solution is finite and valid.
