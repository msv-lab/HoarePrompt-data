Reasoning:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - When `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES" three times and returns `n`.
   - When `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO".
   - When `n >= k`, the logic needs more scrutiny.
   
2. **Logic for `n >= k`**:
   - The program calculates the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1` and stores it in `h`.
   - If `h < k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", "2", and the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - For `n >= k`, the goal is to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The approach of using two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels:
     - In the first stall, Alice can buy up to `n // (n - k + 1)` jewels, which is at most 1 since `n - k + 1` is at least 1.
     - In the second stall, Alice can buy up to `n // 1` jewels, which is `n` since the price is 1.
     - The total number of jewels bought is `1 + (n - 1) = n - 1 + 1 = n - (n - k) = k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n == k`, the solution works as expected.
   - If `n > k`, the solution also works as expected because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels by buying 1 from the first stall and the rest from the second stall.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles all cases as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
