Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program only checks if `n` is equal to `k` or if `n` is greater than `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO". However, the solution should consider setting up multiple stalls with different prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Stall Prices**: The program attempts to use binary search (`bs`) which is not defined and not necessary for the problem. Instead, it tries to calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall but does not correctly distribute the prices among the stalls.

3. **Logic for Setting Up Stalls**: The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is flawed. It does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels across the stalls.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to distribute the prices among the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize the number of stalls and prices
    num_stalls = 0
    prices = []
    
    # Distribute the prices to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels
    current_price = 1
    while k > 0:
        if n >= current_price:
            n -= current_price
            k -= 1
            num_stalls += 1
            prices.append(current_price)
            current_price *= 2
        else:
            current_price //= 2
    
    # Check if we have used at most 60 stalls
    if num_stalls > 60:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(num_stalls)
        print(" ".join(map(str, prices)))
```

This approach ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by distributing the prices in a way that she buys one jewel at each price level until she reaches the desired count `k`.
