### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall in sequence until she runs out of coins or cannot afford any more jewels.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is supposed to determine if it's possible to achieve exactly `k` jewels and, if so, output the necessary details.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it directly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, which is correct because Alice would buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is 1 coin.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy even one jewel.
   - Otherwise, it initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and 1. These values are used to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
     - The first value `n - k + 1` ensures that Alice can buy at least one jewel from the first stall.
     - The second value `1` ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from the second stall.
   - It then calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) using these prices.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given prices.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls (2 in this case), and the prices for the stalls.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling the special case when `n == k` is correct.
   - The logic for checking if `n < k` is also correct.
   - The calculation of the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall and the total number of jewels is correct.
   - However, the implementation of the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is flawed. Specifically, the use of `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]` does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the function calculates `costs = [248, 1]`, but this does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly 8 jewels. Instead, Alice would buy 128 jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling 129 jewels, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is flawed and does not work for all cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
