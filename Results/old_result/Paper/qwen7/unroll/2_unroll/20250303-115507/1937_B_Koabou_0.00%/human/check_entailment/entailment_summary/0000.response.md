Reasoning:

1. **Function Structure**: The program defines a function `func_1()` that processes each test case independently. This is correct since each test case should be handled separately.
2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and the two binary strings. This part is correct.
3. **String Construction (`s`)**: The logic for constructing the string `s` is flawed. The current implementation tries to find a point where the first row has a '1' and the second row has a '0', and then concatenates up to that point from the first row and the rest from the second row. However, this approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest string. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   2
   001
   100
   ```
   The current logic would construct `s` as `00100`, but the lexicographically smallest string should be `000`.
4. **Path Count Calculation (`t`)**: The variable `t` is always set to 1 or calculated based on a condition that is not relevant to finding the lexicographically smallest string. This part is also incorrect.

Given the above points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
