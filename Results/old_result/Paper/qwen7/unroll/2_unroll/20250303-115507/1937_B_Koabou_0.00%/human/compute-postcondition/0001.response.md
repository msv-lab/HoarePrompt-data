Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` and `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and `a` remains an empty list.
