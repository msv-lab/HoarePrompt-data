Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation**: The logic to find the lexicographically smallest path is flawed. The current implementation checks for a specific condition (`if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`) which is too restrictive. Instead, it should ensure that the path taken minimizes the string lexicographically. This means the path should take the leftmost '1' whenever possible to minimize the string.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Paths**: The counting of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is also incorrect. The current approach does not account for all possible paths that could result in the same lexicographically smallest string.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Lexicographically Smallest Path**: Start from the top-left cell and move right or down, always taking the leftmost '1' when possible.
2. **Count the Number of Such Paths**: Use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to achieve the lexicographically smallest path.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = defaultdict(int)
    dp[(0, 0)] = 1
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(2):
            if i > 0:
                dp[(i, j)] += dp[(i-1, j)]
            if j > 0:
                dp[(i, j)] += dp[(i, j-1)]
            if a[j][i] == '1':
                dp[(i, j)] = 1
    
    # Determine the lexicographically smallest path
    path = ''
    i, j = n-1, 1
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if j > 0 and (i == 0 or a[1][i-1] == '0'):
            path = '1' + path
            j -= 1
        else:
            path = '0' + path
            i -= 1
    
    # Output the results
    print(path)
    print(dp[(n-1, 1)])

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected program ensures that the lexicographically smallest path is found and counts the number of such paths correctly.
