### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads the number of columns `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]` for each test case.
   - Initializes an empty list `s` and an integer `x` to 0.
   - Iterates through the first `n-1` positions to find the first mismatch between the two strings where `a[0][i+1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'. If such a position is found, it constructs the string `s` by taking the prefix of `a[0]` up to `i+1` and appending the rest of `a[1]` starting from `i`.
   - Sets `x` to the position `i` where the mismatch was found.
   - Iterates through the first `x` positions to check if the prefix of `a[0]` matches the prefix of `s`. If a match is found, it sets `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks the loop. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.

2. **Output**:
   - Prints the constructed string `s`.
   - Prints the value of `t`.

### Analysis:

- **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
  - The logic to find the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The program only checks for the first position where `a[0][i+1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'. This approach does not guarantee finding the smallest possible string because it does not consider all possible paths.
  - For example, in the second test case (`1101`, `1100`), the program would incorrectly choose the first '1' in `a[0]` and construct `s` as `11000`, missing the possibility of constructing `11000` by taking the path that avoids the first '1' in `a[0]`.

- **Counting Paths**:
  - The logic to count the number of paths yielding the smallest string is also flawed. The program always prints `1` for `t`, which is incorrect because there could be multiple paths yielding the same lexicographically smallest string.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to find the lexicographically smallest string and does not accurately count the number of paths yielding that string.

### Correctness:

**False**
