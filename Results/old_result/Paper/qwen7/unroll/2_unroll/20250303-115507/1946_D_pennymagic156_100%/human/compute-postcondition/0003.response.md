Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 29.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to -1 (since the step is -1).
4. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `i` should be initialized to 29 and should decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a value returned by `func_3()`
- `x` is a value returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a value returned by `func_1()`
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1

Only the state of `i` needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is 29**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 29**
