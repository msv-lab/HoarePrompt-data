Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple (n, x) where n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, and x is an integer less than 2^30. It also accepts a list a of n integers, where each integer in the list is less than 2^30. The function returns the maximum count of consecutive 1s found during the loop execution, which is either the maximum count or the length of the list a.**
