Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1.**

The code initializes two variables, `t` and `ans`. `t` is assigned an empty list `[]`, and `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
