Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5, and the characters are only 'A' or 'B', the logic to count and compare the frequencies works as intended. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description.
