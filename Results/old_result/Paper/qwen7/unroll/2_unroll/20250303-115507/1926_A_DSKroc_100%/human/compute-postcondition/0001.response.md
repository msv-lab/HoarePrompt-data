Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `q` and the value `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 32.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q < t`. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once if `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` is the only variable that directly controls the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
