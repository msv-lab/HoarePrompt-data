### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
3. **String Iteration**: It iterates through each character in the string and increments the appropriate counter based on whether the character is 'A' or 'B'.
4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the characters, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If 'A' is more frequent, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
5. **Edge Cases**: Since the problem specifies that the input strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B', the logic should handle all possible combinations correctly.
6. **Output Format**: The program outputs the result in the required format, with one letter per line for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct and will produce the expected output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
