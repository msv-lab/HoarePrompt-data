Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 676`. The values of `n` and `k` are now specific integers within their respective ranges.
