You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:

        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
    #
    #Explanation: The value of `t` changes based on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be updated according to the logic inside the loop. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we cannot give a precise numerical value for `t`. However, we know that `t` will be constrained between 1 and 10^4, and it will be updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is incremented by 1 to ensure enough space for all 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to round up to the nearest integer when dividing by 4).
   - This calculation ensures that there are enough 2x2 icons placed without overlap.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t1` calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. It uses the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `15` is the total number of cells in a 5x3 grid.
   - This formula accounts for the space left after placing `t` full grids of 2x2 icons.

4. **Placing 1x1 Icons**:
   - `t2` calculates how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space (`t1`).
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using the formula `a - t1` and then divides by 15 (cells per grid) and rounds up.

5. **Output**:
   - The final number of screens required is printed for each test case.

### Testing with Provided Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to verify its correctness.

#### Test Case 1: `1 1`
- `t = 1` (since `b = 1` and `1 % 2 != 0` so `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`)
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
- `t2 = 1 - 11 = -10` (not possible, so `t = 1`)

#### Test Case 2: `7 2`
- `t = 2` (since `b = 2` and `2 % 2 == 0` so `t = 2 // 2 = 1`)
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
- `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0` (no additional screens needed)
- `t = 1`

#### Test Case 3: `12 4`
- `t = 2` (since `b = 4` and `4 % 2 == 0` so `t = 4 // 2 = 2`)
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`
- `t2 = 12 - 22 = -10` (not possible, so `t = 2`)

#### Test Case 4: `0 3`
- `t = 2` (since `b = 3` and `3 % 2 != 0` so `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`)
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`
- `t2 = 0 - 18 = -18` (not possible, so `t = 2`)

#### Test Case 5: `1 0`
- `t = 1` (since `b = 0` and `0 % 2 == 0` so `t = 0 // 2 = 0`)
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
- `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1` (one additional screen needed)
- `t = 1`
