The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and updates the value of \(t\) based on specific conditions. The final value of \(t\) is printed for each test case. The value of \(t\) is constrained between 1 and \(10^4\), and it is updated according to the logic inside the loop body.
