### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is incremented by 1 to ensure enough space for all 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to round up to the nearest integer when dividing by 4).
   - This calculation ensures that there are enough 2x2 icons placed without overlap.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t1` calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. It uses the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `15` is the total number of cells in a 5x3 grid.
   - This formula accounts for the space left after placing `t` full grids of 2x2 icons.

4. **Placing 1x1 Icons**:
   - `t2` calculates how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space (`t1`).
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using the formula `a - t1` and then divides by 15 (cells per grid) and rounds up.

5. **Output**:
   - The final number of screens required is printed for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

Let's break down the logic and verify it with some examples:

#### Example 1: `1 1`
- `t = 1` (since `b = 1` and `1 % 2 != 0` so `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`)
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
- `t2 = 1 - 11 = -10` (not possible, so `t = 1`)

This matches the expected result of 1 screen.

#### Example 2: `7 2`
- `t = 2` (since `b = 2` and `2 % 2 == 0` so `t = 2 // 2 = 1`)
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
- `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0` (no additional screens needed)
- `t = 1`

This matches the expected result of 1 screen.

#### Example 3: `12 4`
- `t = 2` (since `b = 4` and `4 % 2 == 0` so `t = 4 // 2 = 2`)
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`
- `t2 = 12 - 22 = -10` (not possible, so `t = 2`)

This matches the expected result of 2 screens.

#### Example 4: `0 3`
- `t = 2` (since `b = 3` and `3 % 2 != 0` so `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`)
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`
- `t2 = 0 - 18 = -18` (not possible, so `t = 2`)

This matches the expected result of 2 screens.

#### Example 5: `1 0`
- `t = 1` (since `b = 0` and `0 % 2 == 0` so `t = 0 // 2 = 0`)
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
- `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1` (one additional screen needed)
- `t = 1`

This matches the expected result of 1 screen.
