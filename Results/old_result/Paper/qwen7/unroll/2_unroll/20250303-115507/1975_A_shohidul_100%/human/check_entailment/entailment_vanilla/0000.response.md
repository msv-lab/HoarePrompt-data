### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The given solution checks this condition in a few steps.
   
2. **Initial Check**: The function starts by checking if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it prints 'YES' immediately.

3. **Finding a Potential Split Point**: If the array is not initially sorted, the function iterates through possible split points (`i` from 1 to `n-1`). For each split point:
   - It creates a new subarray `new` starting from index `i`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray.
     - `new_all`: Ensures that the new subarray itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Validation**: If both conditions are met for any split point, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It correctly identifies potential split points and checks if the resulting array can be sorted.
   - The logic for checking the split points and conditions is sound.

6. **Output Format**: The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting and swapping parts. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
