Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.
3. The program first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because no operation is needed.
4. If the array is not non-decreasing, it enters a loop to find a valid split point `i` where the subarray `a[i:]` is non-decreasing and the subarray `a[:i]` is non-increasing.
   - It checks if the first part `a[:i]` is non-increasing by verifying `all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`.
   - It also checks if the second part `a[i:]` is non-decreasing by verifying `all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`.
   - If both conditions are met for any split point `i`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If no such split point is found, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the logic implemented in the function appears to be correct. The function checks the necessary conditions to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing through the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
