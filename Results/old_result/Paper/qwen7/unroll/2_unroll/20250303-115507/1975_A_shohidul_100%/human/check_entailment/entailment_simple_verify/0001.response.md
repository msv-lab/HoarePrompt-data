### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The given solution checks this condition in a few steps.

2. **Initial Check**: The function starts by checking if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. This is correct because if the array is already sorted, no further operations are needed.

3. **Finding a Potential Split Point**: If the array is not initially sorted, the function iterates through possible split points (`i` from 1 to `n-1`). For each split point:
   - It creates a new subarray `new` starting from index `i`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray. This condition is incorrect. The condition should ensure that the first element of the original array is less than or equal to every element in the new subarray.
     - `new_all`: Ensures that the new subarray itself is sorted in non-decreasing order. This condition is correct.

4. **Validation**: If both conditions are met for any split point, the function prints 'YES'. However, the condition `check_all_new` is incorrect. It should be `all([a[0] <= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` instead of `all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It correctly identifies potential split points and checks if the resulting array can be sorted.
   - The logic for checking the split points and conditions is almost sound, but the incorrect condition needs to be fixed.

6. **Output Format**: The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The provided code has a logical error in the condition `check_all_new`. The condition should ensure that the first element of the original array is less than or equal to every element in the new subarray, not greater than or equal to. This error can lead to incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the logical error in the condition `check_all_new`.
