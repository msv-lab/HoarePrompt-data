### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The given solution checks this condition in a few steps.

2. **Initial Check**: The function starts by checking if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it prints 'YES' immediately. This part is correct.

3. **Finding a Potential Split Point**: If the array is not initially sorted, the function iterates through possible split points (`i` from 1 to `n-1`). For each split point:
   - It creates a new subarray `new` starting from index `i`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray.
     - `new_all`: Ensures that the new subarray itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Validation**: If both conditions are met for any split point, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for checking the split points and conditions. Specifically, the condition `check_all_new` is not correctly implemented. It should ensure that the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray, but the current implementation does not check this properly.

6. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The condition `check_all_new` should be `all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`, but the current implementation is `all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` which is redundant and does not serve the intended purpose.
   - The condition `new_all` is correctly implemented as `all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n):
         if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
             new = a[i:]
             check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[j] for j in range(len(new))])
             new_all = all([new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, len(new))])
             if check_all_new and new_all:
                 print('YES')
                 break
             else:
                 print('NO')
                 break
     ```

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code has a logical error in the condition `check_all_new`, which makes the overall logic incorrect. Therefore, the function may produce incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The provided code is incorrect due to the logical error in the condition `check_all_new`.
