Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program correctly reads the values of `n` (number of coins Alice has) and `k` (number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - The logic to determine if it's possible to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels is correct:
     - If `n < k`, it's impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels, so the program prints "NO".
     - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying one jewel from a single stall, so the program prints "YES" and the details.
     - If `n > k`, the program checks if it's possible to achieve exactly `k` jewels by setting up stalls with specific prices:
       - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it means Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first `k-1` stalls and then use the remaining coins to buy one more jewel from the next stall. This is handled correctly.
       - If `k - 1 â‰¥ n - k + 1`, it's impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels, so the program prints "NO".

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" as required.
   - When printing "YES", it correctly outputs the number of stalls and the prices for those stalls.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and output handling are correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
