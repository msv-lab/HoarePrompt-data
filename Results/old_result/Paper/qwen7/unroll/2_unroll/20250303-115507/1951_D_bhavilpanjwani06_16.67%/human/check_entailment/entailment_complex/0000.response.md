Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1()` Logic**: The function `func_1()` only handles one test case at a time. However, the main loop in the annotated program calls `func_1()` without handling multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The problem specifies that there are multiple test cases, and the number of test cases `t` is read from the input. The program should iterate over these test cases, but it does not do so.

3. **Incorrect Output Handling**: For each test case, the function should print "YES" or "NO" followed by the appropriate details if applicable. However, the function does not handle this correctly for multiple test cases.

Given the above points, the program is missing the necessary logic to process multiple test cases and print the results accordingly.

Correctness: **False**
