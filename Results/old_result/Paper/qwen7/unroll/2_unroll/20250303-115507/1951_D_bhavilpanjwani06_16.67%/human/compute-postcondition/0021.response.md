Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. If `n` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the condition `(k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1)` is true, no changes are made to the variables. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables as well.
