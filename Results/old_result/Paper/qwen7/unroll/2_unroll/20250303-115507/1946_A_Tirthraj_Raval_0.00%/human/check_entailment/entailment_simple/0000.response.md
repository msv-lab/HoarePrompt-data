Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated in the problem description. The program simply counts the occurrences of the median value in the sorted array, which is not the correct approach to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
2. The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array. The current implementation does not account for the necessary operations to achieve this.
3. To correctly solve the problem, we need to compare each element with the median and calculate how many operations are needed to make the median larger than its current value. The program should identify the median position and then determine the minimum operations required to make the median strictly greater than its current value.

Correctness: **False**
