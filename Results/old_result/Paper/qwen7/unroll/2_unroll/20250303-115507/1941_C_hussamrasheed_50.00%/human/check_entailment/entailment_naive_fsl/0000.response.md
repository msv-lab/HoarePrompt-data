Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which does not guarantee the minimum deletions required.

For example, consider the input:
```
9
mmapnapie
```
The program would output `2`, but the correct answer is `2` (by deleting the 4th and 9th characters). However, consider another input:
```
9
ppiee
```
The program would output `2`, but the correct answer is `0` since the string is already beautiful.

The program fails to actually remove characters and instead just counts occurrences, which does not always yield the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful.
