You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with a total length sum not exceeding 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        m = s.count('map')
        
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        
        p = s.count('pie')
        
        print(m + p)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` minus the total number of 'map' occurrences in all inputs plus the total number of 'pie' occurrences in all inputs.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "map" using `s.count('map')` and stores this count in `m`.
   - It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using `s.replace('map', '')`.
   - Finally, it counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` using `s.count('pie')` and stores this count in `p`.
   - The result printed is the sum of `m` and `p`.

3. **Analysis of the Approach**:
   - The approach correctly identifies the occurrences of "map" but incorrectly assumes that removing all occurrences of "map" will also remove all occurrences of "pie". This is not true because "pie" could still exist in the string after removing "map".
   - For example, consider the string "piepie". After removing "map", the string remains "piepie", which still contains "pie" and is not beautiful.
   - The solution fails to account for the possibility of "pie" existing independently in the string after removing "map".

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through the string and remove characters dynamically to ensure no "pie" or "map" substrings remain.
   - We should keep track of the indices where "pie" or "map" start and remove these characters incrementally until the string is free of both substrings.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given solution is incorrect because it does not properly handle the removal of "pie" after removing "map". It only counts occurrences and removes them without ensuring the string becomes beautiful.
