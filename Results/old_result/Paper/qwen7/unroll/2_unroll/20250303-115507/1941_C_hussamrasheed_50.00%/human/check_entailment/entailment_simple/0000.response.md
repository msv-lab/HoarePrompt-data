Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful, meaning it should not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
2. The annotated program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string and prints their sum. This approach is incorrect because:
   - It does not account for overlapping substrings.
   - It does not provide the minimum number of deletions needed to remove all instances of "map" and "pie".
3. The correct approach would involve iterating through the string and keeping track of the minimum deletions required to avoid both "map" and "pie" substrings simultaneously.
4. The provided solution only counts occurrences and does not perform the necessary deletions to achieve the desired result.

Correctness: **False**
