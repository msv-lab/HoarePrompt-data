The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of an integer `n` and a string `s`. It counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in each `s`, removes all instances of 'map' from `s`, counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified `s`, and prints the sum of these two counts. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total sum of these counts across all test cases.
