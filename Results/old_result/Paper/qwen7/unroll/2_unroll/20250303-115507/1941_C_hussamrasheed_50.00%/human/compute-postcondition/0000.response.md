Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the input operation. The other conditions and variables specified in the initial state remain unchanged.
