Output State: **`idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, and both are such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where every `i` index that is a multiple of `k + j` for `j` in range(`k`) contains the value `j // (k // 2) + 1`, `result` is a string containing space-separated integers from the `permutation` list.**

Explanation: The code joins the elements of the `permutation` list into a single string where each element is converted to a string and separated by spaces. This operation does not change the values of `idx`, `n`, `k`, or `permutation`, but it introduces a new variable `result` which is a string representation of the `permutation` list.
