Output State: **`idx` is n // 2 - 1, `n` is an integer representing the size of the array `a`, and 3 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros; `prev` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n - 1) // 2` to the variable `idx`. Given that `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `idx` will be `n // 2 - 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `prev` remain unchanged.
