### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of points you can get in the game.
   - You and Nene each have `n` cards, and Nene plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

3. **Optimal Strategy Analysis:**
   - For each unique integer `x` in your hand, if there is at least one other card with the same integer `x` in Nene's hand, she will place one of her cards with `x` on the table to block you from scoring.
   - Therefore, for each unique integer `x`, you can score at most one point if there is another card with `x` in Nene's hand.

4. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The given program counts how many times each integer appears in your hand using the `cnt` array.
   - For each count `x` in `cnt`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`. This means if there are `x` cards with a particular integer, you can score at most `x - 1` points (since Nene can block one of them).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the distribution of cards correctly and calculates the maximum possible points you can get based on the counts of each integer.
   - However, the program does not account for the fact that Nene will also try to minimize your score by playing optimally. The current implementation only considers the counts and does not simulate Nene's optimal moves.

6. **Verification:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program, but this does not guarantee the correctness for all edge cases.
   - The logic of counting occurrences and calculating the maximum possible points does not fully capture Nene's optimal strategy.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n` is the number of cards each player receives.
  - `a` is the list of integers on the cards in your hand.

- **Counting Occurrences:**
  - The `cnt` array is initialized to count the occurrences of each integer from 1 to `n`.
  - For each integer `x` in `a`, the corresponding count in `cnt` is incremented.

- **Calculating Maximum Points:**
  - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
  - For each count `x` in `cnt`, `max(0, x - 1)` is added to `ans`.
  - This means if there are `x` cards with a particular integer, you can score at most `x - 1` points (since Nene can block one of them).

- **Final Output:**
  - The value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The program does not simulate Nene's optimal strategy. It only counts the occurrences of each integer and calculates the maximum possible points based on those counts.
- Nene's strategy involves not just blocking your points but also minimizing your score. The current implementation does not account for this.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene. It only counts the occurrences and does not simulate Nene's optimal strategy.

### Final:
**False**
