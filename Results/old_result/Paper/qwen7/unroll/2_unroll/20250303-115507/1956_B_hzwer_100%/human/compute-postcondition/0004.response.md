Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and a list a containing n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. The function returns a result based on the input for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list `a`. It processes these inputs according to the specified constraints and returns a result for each test case.
