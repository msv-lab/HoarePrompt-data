Output State: The value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum values of 0 and `x-1` for each element `x` in the list `cnt`. Here, `cnt` is an array where each index `i` (from 1 to n) holds the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. The value of `ans` is calculated by iterating through `cnt` and adding `max(0, x-1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.
