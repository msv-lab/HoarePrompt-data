Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and the list \( a \) which contains the integers on the cards in the player's hand.
3. It then creates a count array `cnt` to store the frequency of each integer from 1 to \( n \).
4. The program iterates over the list \( a \) and updates the count array `cnt`.
5. Next, it calculates the answer for each test case. The logic `ans += max(0, x - 1)` for each count \( x \) in `cnt` is correct because:
   - If \( x = 1 \), `max(0, x - 1) = 0`, meaning the player cannot earn any points since there is no duplicate card on the table.
   - If \( x > 1 \), `max(0, x - 1) = x - 1`, meaning the player can earn up to \( x - 1 \) points if they strategically place their cards.
6. The final result for each test case is printed correctly.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of points the player can get by playing optimally.

Correctness: **True**
