Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in `a` at most twice; the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.readline` reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`. This changes how input is read from the standard input, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the constraints and values of these variables remain unchanged.
