Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The function `func_1` simply calculates the difference between the total length of the string and the count of '+' characters, and then returns the absolute value of the difference between this difference and the count of '+' characters. This does not align with the problem statement which requires splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: According to the problem, the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program does not account for this. Instead, it just computes a simple difference and its absolute value, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation.

3. **Optimal Splitting**: The program does not attempt to find an optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. It only considers a straightforward count-based approach without considering the actual sums of potential subarrays.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
