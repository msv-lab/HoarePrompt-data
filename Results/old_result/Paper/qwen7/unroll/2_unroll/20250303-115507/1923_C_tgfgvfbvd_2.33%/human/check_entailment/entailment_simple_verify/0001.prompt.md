You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: Output State: After processing all test cases, for each query, the program prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in the subarray from index `a-1` to `b-1` is at least twice the length of the subarray, otherwise it prints 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires checking if a subarray is "good" based on certain conditions. A subarray is considered good if there exists another array `b` of the same length where:
   - The sum of elements in both arrays is equal.
   - No element in the subarray is the same in both arrays.
   - All elements in the subarray are positive.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `c` of length `n`.
   - For each query, it calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and checks if the subarray is good based on the sum condition.

3. **Key Points to Check**:
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the prefix sums.
   - **Subarray Sum Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums.
   - **Good Subarray Condition**: The code checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (`2 * (b - a + 1)`), which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the subarray to be good. This condition ensures that the subarray has enough positive values to form a valid `b` array.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the subarray to be good. It does not guarantee that the subarray can be transformed into a valid `b` array where no element is the same and all elements are positive.
   - The code does not check if the subarray can be rearranged to satisfy the other conditions (no element is the same, and all elements are positive).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not fully implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is good. It only checks a necessary condition and does not ensure that the subarray can be transformed into a valid `b` array.
