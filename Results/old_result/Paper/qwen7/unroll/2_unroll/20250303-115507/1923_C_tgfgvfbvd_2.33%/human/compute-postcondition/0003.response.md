Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through queries on an array `c` of length `n`. For each query defined by `l_i` and `r_i`, it returns a value based on the subarray of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i`.**

This means the function indirectly accepts an array `c` of positive integers and two integers `n` and `q` representing the length of the array and the number of queries, respectively. It also accepts two integers `l_i` and `r_i` for each query, and returns a value (not specified in the given output) based on the subarray of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i`.
