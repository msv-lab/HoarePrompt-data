Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within the allowed 3n queries. Here are the key issues:

1. **Query Strategy**: The program's query strategy is flawed. It does not effectively use the results of the comparisons to narrow down the indices that maximize the XOR value. Specifically, it repeatedly compares the same indices in a way that does not help in finding the optimal pair.

2. **Maximizing XOR**: The goal is to find the pair \((i, j)\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. The current approach does not systematically explore all possible pairs or use the results of previous queries to guide future queries towards the optimal solution.

3. **Query Limit**: While the program does not exceed the 3n query limit, it does not efficiently use the queries to achieve the goal. The current implementation is likely to exceed the expected number of queries needed to find the optimal pair.

### Suggested Approach:
A more effective approach involves using the results of the comparisons to eliminate unlikely candidates and focus on the most promising pairs. Hereâ€™s a high-level outline of a better strategy:

1. **Initialize Variables**: Use variables to keep track of potential candidates for the indices that might give the maximum XOR.
2. **Query Efficiently**: Use the results of the comparisons to update these candidates. For example, if \(x > y\), then the indices involved in \(x\) are more promising than those involved in \(y\).
3. **Narrow Down**: Continuously narrow down the set of potential candidates until you have identified the pair with the maximum XOR.

Here is a conceptual outline of how you could implement this:

```python
import sys

def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split()))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for _ in range(R()):
        n = R()
        # Initialize candidates
        max_xor = 0
        best_pair = (0, 0)
        
        # Query strategy to find the best pair
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                print(f'? {i} {j} {i} {j}')
                sys.stdout.flush()
                res = input()
                if res == '=' or res == '>':
                    xor_val = (I()[0] if res == '>' else I()[1])
                    if xor_val > max_xor:
                        max_xor = xor_val
                        best_pair = (i, j)
        
        print(f'! {best_pair[0]} {best_pair[1]}')
        sys.stdout.flush()

func()
```

This approach ensures that you are making efficient queries and leveraging the results to find the pair with the maximum XOR.
