### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the permutation.

2. **Initial Query Strategy**:
   - The code starts by querying pairs \((v1, v1)\) and \((v2, v2)\) for \(v1 = 0\) and \(v2 = i\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - This helps in identifying the highest value element in the permutation, as it will always satisfy the condition \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\), and thus, the comparison will only depend on the other elements.

3. **Identifying the Maximum Element**:
   - The code sets `v1` to the current highest value found so far (`i`).
   - For each subsequent index `i`, it queries \((v1, i)\) and \((v1, prev)\) to determine if `i` is greater than `prev`.
   - If the response is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`.

4. **Final Pair Selection**:
   - After determining the highest value element, the code selects it as `v1` and finds another element `prev` that is greater than `prev` when compared using bitwise OR operations.
   - It then prints the indices of these two elements as the answer.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The initial loop runs \(n-1\) times, and the subsequent loop runs \(n-1\) times, totaling \(2(n-1)\) queries.
   - Since \(2(n-1) \leq 3n\) for \(n \geq 2\), the query limit is respected.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The strategy correctly identifies the highest value element and then finds another element that maximizes the XOR with it.
   - The approach ensures that the XOR value is maximized by leveraging the properties of bitwise OR and XOR operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided code follows the problem's requirements and constraints correctly. It uses the allowed number of queries and finds a valid pair of indices that maximize the XOR value.

### Correctness:
**True**
