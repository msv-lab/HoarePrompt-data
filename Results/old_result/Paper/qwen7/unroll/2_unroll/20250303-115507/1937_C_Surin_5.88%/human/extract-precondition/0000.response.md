Precondition: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem description implies that the function should interact with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. The variables n, a, b, c, d, x, y, and the permutation p are not part of the function's parameters but are used in the interaction process.**
