Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and interacts with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. Based on the responses, it may return either an error message if the age is negative or categorize the input as 'minor' or 'adult'.**

This means the function does not take any explicit parameters but rather performs operations involving external interactions. It checks if the age is negative and returns an error if true. Otherwise, it categorizes the age as either 'minor' or 'adult'.
