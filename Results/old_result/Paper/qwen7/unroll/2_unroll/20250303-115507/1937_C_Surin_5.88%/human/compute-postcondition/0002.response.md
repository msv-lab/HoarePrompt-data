Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `kp`: This is the loop variable.
   - `int(input())`: This is the upper limit for the range function.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `I` is a lambda function that takes no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.
   - `R` is a lambda function that takes no parameters and returns an integer obtained from the input.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `kp` is less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The initial value of `kp` is 0 (since it starts from 0).
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
