Output State: **n**, **k**, **v=k**.

Explanation: The loop runs from `n` down to `1`. Inside the loop, it prints a query and updates `v` to the return value of `func_2()`. If `v` equals `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. Since `v` is initially `1`, and the loop does not explicitly change `k` or `n`, these values remain the same. The final value of `v` will be set to `i` when `v` equals `n` for the first time, which means `v` will be set to `k` (since `k` is within the range of `n`).
