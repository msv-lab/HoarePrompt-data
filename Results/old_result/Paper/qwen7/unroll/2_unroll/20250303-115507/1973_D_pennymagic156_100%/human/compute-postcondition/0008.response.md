Output State: **`n` is divided into groups where each group's sum is `v`, and the number of such groups is `n//k + 1`. The function `func_2()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_2()` is called, which does not modify the values of `n`, `v`, or `k`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged. The only effect is the execution of the function `func_2()`.
