Output State: **n is divided into groups where each group's sum is v, and the number of such groups is n//k + 1.**

Explanation: The loop iterates `n // k + 1` times, creating groups where each group's sum is `v`. The variable `cnt` controls the number of elements added to each group, and `l` keeps track of the current element being considered. If a group's sum reaches `v`, it prints the group sum and moves to the next iteration. Once all groups are formed and their sums are printed, the function returns.
