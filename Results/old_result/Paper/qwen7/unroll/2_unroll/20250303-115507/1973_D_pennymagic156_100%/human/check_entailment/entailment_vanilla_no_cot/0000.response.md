To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step against the problem statement.

### Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `n` and `k` using `func_5()` which is equivalent to reading the input and splitting it into integers.

2. **Finding Maximum Product Value (`v`):**
   - The program iterates from `n` down to `1`, querying the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
   - This ensures that the maximum product value `v` is found by checking the highest possible values first.

3. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The program then tries to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's product equals `v`.
   - It does this by iterating through the array and checking if the current segment can be part of the required subarray.

4. **Querying for Each Segment:**
   - For each potential starting point `l`, it queries the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - If it finds a valid `r` for all segments, it prints the result and returns.
   - If it fails to find valid segments, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Finding Maximum Product Value (`v`):**
   - The logic to find `v` is correct. By starting from the highest possible values and working downwards, it ensures that the maximum product value is found efficiently.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The logic to split the array into `k` subarrays is mostly correct but could be improved for efficiency.
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the current segment can be part of the required subarray. However, it might not handle edge cases properly, especially when the array is small or the value of `k` is large.

3. **Querying for Each Segment:**
   - The program queries for each segment correctly, ensuring that the segment meets the criteria before moving on to the next segment.
   - However, the program might not handle the case where no valid split exists efficiently.

### Potential Issues

1. **Efficiency:**
   - The program might exceed the query limit for large arrays or high values of `k`.
   - The program could benefit from more efficient algorithms to reduce the number of queries.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program might not handle edge cases where the array is small or the value of `k` is large.
   - It should ensure that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required product.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program is mostly correct but could be improved for efficiency and handling edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
