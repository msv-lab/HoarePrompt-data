Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has a logical flaw. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon must have at least 3 sides, and we want to maximize the number of polygons). However, this approach does not correctly account for the fact that the minimum number of sides required for a polygon is 3, not 4.

To fix this, the function should check the frequency of each stick length and ensure that the minimum requirement for forming a polygon (i.e., having at least 3 sticks of the same length) is met. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    max_polygons = 0
    for value in freq.values():
        max_polygons += value // 3
    return max_polygons
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly counts the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by using the sticks, ensuring that each polygon has at least 3 sides.
