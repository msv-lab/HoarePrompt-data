### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where each polygon's sides must be formed by exactly one stick and no stick can be reused.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Frequency Calculation**: The function calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary (`freq`). This is done correctly by iterating over the list `arr` and updating the frequency of each stick length.
   - **Polygon Construction**: To form a polygon, at least 3 sticks of the same length are required (for a triangle). For a square, 4 sticks of the same length are needed, and so on. Therefore, the function computes how many complete polygons (triangles, squares, etc.) can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since 4 is the minimum number of sticks needed for a square, which is the largest polygon we need to consider given the constraints).
   - **Summation**: The function sums up the integer divisions of the frequencies by 4, effectively counting the total number of polygons that can be formed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are fewer than 3 sticks of any length, no polygon can be formed with those sticks.
   - The function correctly handles this by only considering frequencies that are greater than or equal to 4 when performing the division.

4. **Output**: The function returns the correct result, which is the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
