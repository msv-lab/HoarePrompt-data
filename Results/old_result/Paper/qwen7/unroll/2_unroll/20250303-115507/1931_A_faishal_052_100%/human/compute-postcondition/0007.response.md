Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases (t) where each test case involves an integer n. For each test case, if 1 <= t <= 100 and 3 <= n <= 78, it processes these values, though the specific processing and return values are not detailed here.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a range of test cases defined by `t` and checks if `n` falls within the specified range. However, without more details on the exact operations and return values, the primary description focuses on the implied input parameters and their constraints.
