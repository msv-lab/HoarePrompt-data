The function processes a series of test cases, where each case involves an integer \( n \) such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 78 \). For each case, it performs a series of operations on \( n \) and stores the results in a list. Specifically, it calculates two numbers based on \( n \) and appends them along with the modified \( n \) to a list. After processing all cases, it converts the first two numbers in each list to their corresponding lowercase letters and prints these letters as a string, while the third number is not printed. The function ultimately outputs a series of strings, each representing the processed values of \( n \) in a specific format.
