State: **`cases` is an input integer with 1 <= cases <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `cases`, and the loop itself.
2. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `cases`: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 to 100).
   - `info`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop's condition but is mentioned in the initial state. Since the loop body is omitted, we assume `info` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `cases` is within the valid range and `i` is set to its initial value of 0. The state of `info` being an empty list is already correct and does not need adjustment.
