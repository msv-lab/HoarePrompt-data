Output State: `info` is a list containing 100 lists. Each inner list contains four elements: two integers between 1 and 26 (inclusive), followed by an integer between 0 and 26 (inclusive), and finally an integer between 0 and 27 (inclusive). The first two integers represent the result of the inner loop's logic based on the value of `lex`, and the last two integers are the sorted version of these results. The exact values depend on the input provided during each iteration of the outer loop.
