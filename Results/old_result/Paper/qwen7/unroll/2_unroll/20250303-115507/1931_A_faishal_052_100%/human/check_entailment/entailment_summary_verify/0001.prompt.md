You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each case involves an integer \( n \) such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 78 \). For each case, it performs a series of operations on \( n \) and stores the results in a list. Specifically, it calculates two numbers based on \( n \) and appends them along with the modified \( n \) to a list. After processing all cases, it converts the first two numbers in each list to their corresponding lowercase letters and prints these letters as a string, while the third number is not printed. The function ultimately outputs a series of strings, each representing the processed values of \( n \) in a specific format.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that encodes to a given integer `n`.
   - The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - The letters 'a' to 'z' correspond to indices 1 to 26.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and then processes each test case.
   - It reads the encoded value `lex` for each test case.

3. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program attempts to decode the word by breaking down the encoded value into its constituent letter positions.
   - However, there are several issues with the logic:
     - The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. It incorrectly handles the conditions and does not always produce the smallest possible letters.
     - The final letter is directly appended without ensuring it is the smallest possible.
     - The sorting of the list `arr` does not help in finding the smallest lexicographical order.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start from the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a') and incrementally increase the letters while maintaining the sum.
   - We can use a more systematic approach to ensure the smallest possible letters are chosen.

5. **Testing with Provided Examples:**
   - For `n = 24`, the correct answer is "aav".
   - For `n = 70`, the correct answer is "rzz".
   - For `n = 3`, the correct answer is "aaa".
   - For `n = 55`, the correct answer is "czz".
   - For `n = 48`, the correct answer is "auz".

6. **Code Analysis:**
   - The current code does not correctly handle the decoding process and does not produce the expected results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly decode the encoded values to produce the lexicographically smallest words.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
