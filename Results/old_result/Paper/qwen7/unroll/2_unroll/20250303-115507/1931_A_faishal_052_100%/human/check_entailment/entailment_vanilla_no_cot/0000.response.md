Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded values into the lexicographically smallest word. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program attempts to break down the encoded value into individual character positions, but it does so in a way that doesn't always yield the lexicographically smallest word. Specifically, the logic for determining the character positions is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Encoded Values**:
   - The program tries to directly assign values to `arr` without properly accounting for the constraints and ensuring the lexicographical order.
   - For example, the condition `if lex < 28:` and `elif lex < 52:` do not correctly handle the range of possible values and their corresponding characters.

3. **Improper Sorting and Construction**:
   - The sorting step `arr.sort()` is unnecessary and incorrectly implemented. It should not sort the array after breaking down the encoded value.
   - The construction of the word from the sorted array is also incorrect.

To fix this, we need to correctly decode the encoded value into the lexicographically smallest word. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the lexicographically smallest word
        a = 1
        while a <= 26 and lex >= a + 26 + 26:
            lex -= a + 26 + 26
            a += 1
        b = 1
        while b <= 26 and lex >= b + 26:
            lex -= b + 26
            b += 1
        c = lex
        # Construct the word
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Decoding Process**:
   - We start with the smallest possible value for the first character (`a`).
   - We then determine the smallest possible value for the second character (`b`) such that the remaining value can still form a valid third character (`c`).

2. **Constructing the Word**:
   - Convert the indices back to characters using `chr(a + 96)` and concatenate them to form the final word.

This approach ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is constructed for each encoded value.
