Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and then processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Encoding Logic**: 
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value back into a word. However, the logic for decoding is flawed. It tries to split the encoded value into parts based on fixed thresholds (28, 52, and 78), which is incorrect. These thresholds do not accurately represent the possible decompositions of the encoded value.
   - The program should consider all possible combinations of the three letters that sum up to the given encoded value, starting from 'aaa' and moving lexicographically upwards.

3. **Sorting and Decoding**:
   - The sorting step is unnecessary and incorrect. The program sorts the array `[arr]` which is not required for finding the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The current approach to decoding is flawed and does not guarantee finding the lexicographically smallest word.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The program constructs the word by converting the integers back to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. However, the method to generate the word is incorrect due to the flawed decoding logic.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded.

Correctness: **False**
