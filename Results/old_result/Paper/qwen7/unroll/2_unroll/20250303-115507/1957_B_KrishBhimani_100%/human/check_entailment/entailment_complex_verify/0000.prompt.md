You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: t test cases are processed, each test case outputs two integers separated by a space. For each test case, if n is 1, the output is k itself. Otherwise, the output is a list where the first number is (2^i) - 1, the second number is k minus the first number, and it is padded with zeros to make the total length equal to n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, if \( n \) is 1, it outputs \( k \) itself. Otherwise, it calculates two integers: \( (2^i) - 1 \) and \( k - ((2^i) - 1) \), where \( i \) is determined such that \( 2^i \) is just greater than or equal to \( k \). It then pads the result with zeros to ensure the output list has a length of \( n \). The function outputs these results for each test case, separated by a space.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence maximizes the number of 1s in its binary representation. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  2
  2 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  5 0
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  4 1
  ```

In this case, the program generates `4` and `1` instead of `5` and `0`. The bitwise OR of `4` and `1` is `5`, which has three 1s in its binary representation `(101)_2`. However, the bitwise OR of `5` and `0` is `5`, which also has three 1s in its binary representation `(101)_2`. Both sequences satisfy the sum condition, but the program fails to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the sequence includes as many 1s as possible in its binary representation while still satisfying the sum constraint. One way to achieve this is to include as many `1`s as possible in the sequence and adjust the remaining values to meet the sum requirement.
