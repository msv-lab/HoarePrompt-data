Output State: t test cases where each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by a list of integers. For each test case, if n is 1, the list contains only k. Otherwise, the list contains two non-zero integers followed by zeros, where the sum of the first two integers equals k and both are powers of 2 (or one is a power of 2 and the other is the remainder).
