Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a throwaway variable to iterate over the range produced by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Initial state given**: The initial state is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `t` represents the number of test cases, and each test case will involve reading two integers `n` and `k` from input.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: Since the loop will run for `t` iterations, we need to ensure that `t` is correctly set to a valid value within the given constraints. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, no other variables are directly affected by the loop itself, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute properly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to ensure the loop can execute. The value of `t` should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
