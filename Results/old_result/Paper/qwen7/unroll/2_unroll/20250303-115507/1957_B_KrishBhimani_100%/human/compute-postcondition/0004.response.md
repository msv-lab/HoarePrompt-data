Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, if \( n \) is 1, it outputs \( k \) itself. Otherwise, it calculates two integers: \( (2^i) - 1 \) and \( k - ((2^i) - 1) \), where \( i \) is determined such that \( 2^i \) is just greater than or equal to \( k \). It then pads the result with zeros to ensure the output list has a length of \( n \). The function outputs these results for each test case, separated by a space.**
