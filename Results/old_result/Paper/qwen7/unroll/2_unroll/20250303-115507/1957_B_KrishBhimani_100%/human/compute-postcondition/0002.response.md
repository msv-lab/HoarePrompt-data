Output State: t test cases are processed, each test case outputs two integers separated by a space. For each test case, if n is 1, the output is k itself. Otherwise, the output is a list where the first number is (2^i) - 1, the second number is k minus the first number, and it is padded with zeros to make the total length equal to n.
