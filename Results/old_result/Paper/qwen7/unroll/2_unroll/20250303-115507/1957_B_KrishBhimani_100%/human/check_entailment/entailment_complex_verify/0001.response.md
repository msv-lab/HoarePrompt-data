### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to construct an array of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the array is maximized.

2. **Input and Output Format**: The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing `n` and `k`. For each test case, we need to output a sequence of `n` integers that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n == 1`, the solution is straightforward: print `k`.
   - For larger `n`, we need to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR result.

4. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code attempts to solve the problem by:
     - Handling the case when `n == 1` directly.
     - For `n > 1`, it constructs an array with specific values to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.
     - It uses `(1 << i) - 1` to generate a number with all bits set to `1` up to a certain bit position `i`.
     - It then calculates the remaining value needed to reach `k` and appends zeros to complete the array.

5. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The logic for constructing the array is flawed. Specifically, the use of `(1 << i) - 1` and appending `k - sum(ans)` might not always produce the optimal solution.
   - The approach does not guarantee that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of `1`s. For example, consider `n=2` and `k=3`. The code would output `[2, 1]`, but `[1, 2]` would yield a better result with more `1`s in the bitwise OR.
   - The code does not handle the general case effectively, especially when `k` is small compared to `n`.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - A better approach would involve distributing the value `k` among the `n` elements in a way that maximizes the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.
   - One effective strategy is to use as many `1`s as possible in the binary representation of the elements, ensuring that the sum constraint is met.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- **Test Case Processing**:
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
  - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.
  - For `n > 1`, it constructs an array `ans` with specific values:
    - It finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and sets the first element to `(1 << i) - 1`, where `i` is the bit position.
    - The second element is set to `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.
    - Remaining elements are filled with zeros to ensure the total length is `n`.
  - This construction does not necessarily maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.

### Validation of the Code:

- **Case 1**: `n = 1` and `k = 5`
  - Output: `5`
  - This is correct.

- **Case 2**: `n = 2` and `k = 3`
  - Output: `1 2`
  - Bitwise OR: `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), which has 2 ones.
  - Alternative: `2 | 1 = 3` (binary `11`), which also has 2 ones.
  - The code's output is correct here.

- **Case 3**: `n = 2` and `k = 5`
  - Output: `5 0`
  - Bitwise OR: `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), which has 2 ones.
  - Alternative: `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`), which also has 2 ones.
  - The code's output is correct here.

- **Case 4**: `n = 6` and `k = 51`
  - Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
  - Bitwise OR: `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 37` (binary `100101`), which has 4 ones.
  - The code's output is correct here.
