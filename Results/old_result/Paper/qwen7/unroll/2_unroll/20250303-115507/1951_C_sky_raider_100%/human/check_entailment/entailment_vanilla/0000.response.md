### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting**: The ticket prices list `l` is sorted in ascending order. This is a key point because it allows the algorithm to consider the cheapest prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**: The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0. `t` keeps track of the cumulative effect of previous purchases, `s` represents the number of tickets to be purchased on the current day, and `c` accumulates the total cost.

4. **Loop Through Days**: The loop iterates through each day. For each day:
   - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. This ensures that no more than `m` tickets can be purchased on any single day.
   - The cost for purchasing `s` tickets on the current day is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`, where `l[i]` is the price of a ticket on the current day and `t` is the cumulative effect of previous purchases.
   - The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of the tickets purchased on the current day.
   - The cumulative effect `t` is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased on the current day (`s`).
   - The number of tickets left to be purchased `k` is reduced by `s`.

5. **Output**: The total cost `c` is printed after processing all test cases.

6. **Test Cases**: The provided examples and the function's behavior match the problem statement. The function correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `k` is less than `m` or when the number of days is limited.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
