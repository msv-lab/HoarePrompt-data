Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by the list of ticket prices `a`.
2. The list `l` is sorted, which is unnecessary because the algorithm does not depend on the order of the prices but rather on the cumulative effect of purchasing tickets.
3. The variable `t` is used to keep track of the cumulative increase in ticket price due to previous purchases.
4. The variable `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are purchased in a single day.
5. The variable `c` accumulates the total cost, which is calculated as the product of the number of tickets purchased (`s`) and the current ticket price (`l[i] + t`), with `t` being updated accordingly.
6. The loop runs for `n` iterations, and after each iteration, `k` is decremented by `s`, ensuring that the total number of tickets purchased equals `k`.
7. The final output is the total cost `c`, which is printed as an integer.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
