Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be purchased exceeds the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). Specifically, the program assumes that `k` tickets can always be bought within the constraints of `n` days and `m` tickets per day, which is not necessarily true.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2 5
8 6 4 2
```
Here, `n = 3`, `m = 2`, and `k = 5`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought is `n * m = 3 * 2 = 6`, which is greater than `k = 5`. However, the program does not account for the possibility of buying more than `m` tickets in a single day, which would violate the rule that no more than `m` tickets can be purchased on any single day.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the number of tickets bought each day does not exceed `m` and that the total number of tickets bought does not exceed `k`. The current implementation does not enforce these constraints properly, leading to incorrect results in scenarios where `k` exceeds `nm`.

A correct approach would involve dynamically adjusting the number of tickets bought each day to ensure that the constraints are met.
