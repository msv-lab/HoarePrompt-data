Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case and the list of ticket prices `a`.
3. The list `a` is sorted, which is unnecessary because the algorithm does not rely on the order of the prices but rather on the cumulative effect of buying tickets.
4. The program then iterates through the list `a`, calculating the cost of buying the minimum of `m` and `k` tickets on each day. It updates the total cost `c` and adjusts the number of tickets to be bought `k` and the penalty `t` accordingly.
5. The logic for updating the total cost and the number of tickets to be bought seems to be correct according to the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
