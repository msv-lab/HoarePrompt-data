The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It then calculates a list of integers based on these values and prints the length of this list followed by its elements. The list includes specific values derived from \( k \) and all powers of 2 up to \( 2^{19} \), excluding one particular power of 2. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case, ensuring the output structure is consistent.
