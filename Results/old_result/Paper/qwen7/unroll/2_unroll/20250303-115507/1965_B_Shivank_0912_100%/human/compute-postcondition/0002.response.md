Output State: t test cases are processed. For each test case, the value of n and k are read, and the variable i is set to the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\). Then, a list ans is constructed containing specific values based on k and i. The length of ans and its elements are printed for each test case. The output consists of t lines, each starting with the length of ans followed by the elements of ans.
