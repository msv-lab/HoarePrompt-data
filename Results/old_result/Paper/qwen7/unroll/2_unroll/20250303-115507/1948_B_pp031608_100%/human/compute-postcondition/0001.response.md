State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `n`, which is used as the range parameter for the `range(n)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer and it must be within the range specified (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).
3. The variable `t` is not used in the loop head and its value does not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
