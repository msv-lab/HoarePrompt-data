Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns.
   - It uses a while loop to simulate the game, updating the current score (`cur`) and the maximum score (`mx`) as it iterates.
   - The loop continues until `k` becomes zero or the starting position `s` has been visited before.
   - The function correctly updates the maximum score considering the current score plus the remaining turns' worth of points.

2. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts the indices in `p` and `a` to be zero-based.
   - It calls `func_1` for both players' starting positions (`pb-1` and `ps-1`).
   - It compares the scores returned by `func_1` and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The function and the main program handle the logic correctly for determining the maximum score for each player.
   - The main program ensures that the game is played according to the rules, and the results are printed based on the comparison of the two scores.
   - There are no apparent logical errors or off-by-one mistakes in the provided code.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
