Reasoning:
1. The main loop in the program correctly processes each test case.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a given starting position `s` over `k` turns.
3. The logic within `func_1` is sound:
   - It initializes necessary variables and a visited array to avoid revisiting positions.
   - It iterates based on the permutation `p` and updates the current score and maximum score accordingly.
   - It handles the decrement of `k` and the transition to the next position in the permutation.
4. The comparison and output logic in the main part of the program is also correct, determining the winner based on the scores calculated by `func_1`.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to follow the correct logic and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
