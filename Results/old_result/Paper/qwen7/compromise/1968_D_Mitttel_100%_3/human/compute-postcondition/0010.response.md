Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is decreased by 1
   - `mx` is `max(0, cur + k * a[s])`
   - `cur` is `a[s]`
   - `vis[s]` is 1
   - `s` is updated to `p[s]`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on two variables: `vis[s]` and `k`.
   - `vis[s]` is currently 1, which means the loop will not execute because the first part of the condition `not vis[s]` is false.
   - `k` is decreased by 1 from the previous iteration, but since `k > 0` was true in the previous iteration, `k` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `vis[s]` must be 0 for the loop to execute again, we need to change `vis[s]` to 0.
   - `k` must remain greater than 0, but since it was greater than 0 in the previous iteration and was only decreased by 1, it should still be greater than 0 unless it was exactly 1 before the decrement.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `vis[s]` to 0 and `k` to ensure it remains greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is greater than 0, `vis[s]` is 0**
