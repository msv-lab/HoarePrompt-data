Output State: **`vis[s]` is 1, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]` and `cur` is now equal to `cur + a[s]`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += a[s]` increases the value of `cur` by `a[s]`. All other variables (`vis[s]`, `mx`, `k`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `cur` is updated to reflect the new value after adding `a[s]` to it.
