Output State: `k` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value encountered during the loop (i.e., the highest value of `cur + k * a[s]`), `cur` is the last value of `cur` before `k` became 0, `vis[s]` is 1, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` when `k` becomes 0.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `k` will be 0 because it is decremented until it reaches 0. The variable `mx` will hold the highest value of `cur + k * a[s]` seen during the loop, as this is the primary condition used to update `mx`. The variable `cur` will be set to the value of `cur` just before `k` was decremented to 0. `vis[s]` will be 1 because it is set to 1 in every iteration of the loop. Finally, `s` will be updated to `p[s]` in the last iteration of the loop when `k` is 0.
