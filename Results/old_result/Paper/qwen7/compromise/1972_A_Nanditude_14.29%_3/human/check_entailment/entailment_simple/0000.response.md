Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that for each existing problem \(a_i\), its difficulty does not exceed the expected difficulty \(b_i\). If \(a_i > b_i\), we need to propose a new problem with difficulty \(w\) such that inserting \(w\) and sorting the array results in \(a_i \leq b_i\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It initializes variables `cnt` to count the number of new problems added and uses indices `i` and `j` to traverse arrays `a` and `b`.
   - The while loop iterates until either all elements in `a` or `b` are processed.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element in `b` is less than the current element in `a`. If true, it means the current problem's difficulty exceeds the expected difficulty, and thus, a new problem with difficulty equal to the current element in `b` is proposed.
   - The new problem is inserted into the correct position in `a` by removing the last element and adding the new problem just before the next element in the sorted order.
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented each time a new problem is proposed.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic of the program but is defined. It sorts the input list in reverse order, which is not relevant to solving the problem as stated.

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The logic handles the case when the current problem's difficulty exceeds the expected difficulty by proposing a new problem with the exact difficulty required.
   - The sorting and insertion process ensures that the array remains sorted after each insertion.
   - The loop correctly increments the counters and indices to ensure all elements are processed.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
