Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that `a_i \leq b_i` for all `i`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the count (`cnt`) of new problems and sets up pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. **Main Loop**: The loop runs until either `i` or `j` reaches the end of their respective arrays.
   - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is harder than expected. To fix this, the program proposes a new problem with difficulty `b[j]`, sorts the array `a` accordingly, and increments the count of new problems (`cnt`). It then moves to the next element in `b` (`j += 1`).
   - If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` meets or exceeds the expected difficulty, so it simply moves to the next element in both arrays (`i += 1` and `j += 1`).
4. **Output**: After processing all elements, the program prints the count of new problems required.

Given the logic and the provided example, the program correctly identifies when a new problem needs to be added and ensures that the final array `a` satisfies the condition `a_i \leq b_i` for all `i`.

However, there is a minor issue in the provided code snippet regarding the function `func_1`. This function is not used anywhere in the main program and seems unnecessary. The function `func_1` sorts the input list in reverse order, which is not relevant to the main logic of the program.

Despite this, the core logic of the main program is correct and achieves the intended purpose.

Correctness: **True**
