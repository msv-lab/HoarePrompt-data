Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`**.

Explanation: The code `vx.remove(v3)` removes the element `v3` from the list `vx`. Since `v3` was the return value of `q(0)`, it is removed from the list. The values of `v1` and `v2` are updated based on the new length of `vx`, which is one less than before the removal. The variable `_` is discarded and not mentioned in the final state as it is not referenced afterward.
