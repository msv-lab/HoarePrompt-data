Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `v1` from the list `vx`. Since `v1` was originally `len(vx) - 3`, removing the element at this index means that the length of `vx` decreases by 1. Therefore, `v1` now refers to the element that was at index `len(vx) - 2` before the removal, which is now `len(vx) - 4`. The value of `v2` remains unchanged as it was `len(vx) - 2`. The precondition that `vx` has one less element than before the removal and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2 is updated to `len(vx)` being greater than 1 because the list now has one less element.
