Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, and `vx` has one less element than before the removal.**

Explanation: The code removes `v1` from the list `vx`. Initially, both `v1` and `v2` are equal to `len(vx) - 2`. After removing `v1` from `vx`, the length of `vx` decreases by 1. Consequently, `v1` now represents the second-to-last element of the updated list `vx`, making it `len(vx) - 3`. The value of `v2` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code.
