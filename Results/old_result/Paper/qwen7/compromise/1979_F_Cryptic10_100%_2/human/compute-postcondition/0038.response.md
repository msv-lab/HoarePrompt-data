Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `(v1, v2) in ops[::-1]`. This means the loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, where each element is a tuple containing two elements, `v1` and `v2`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are tuples left in the reversed `ops` list.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` contains valid tuples.
   - The length of `ops` matches the number of iterations.
   - The last tuple's first element is `v1`.
   - The last tuple's second element is `v2`.
   - The list within the last tuple is appended with `v1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, the next tuple to be processed would be the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - The `v1` and `v2` values for the next iteration would be the first and second elements of this second-to-last tuple, respectively.
   - The list within this tuple would be the same as the last tuple's list but without the appended `v1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The length of `ops` will be reduced by one because the last tuple has been processed.
   - The last tuple's first element (`v1`) and second element (`v2`) will be the values from the second-to-last tuple.
   - The list within the last tuple will be the list from the second-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`ops` contains valid tuples, the length of `ops` is one less than before, the last tuple's first element is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, the last tuple's second element is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, and the list within the last tuple is the list from the second-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.**

State: **`ops` contains valid tuples, the length of `ops` is one less than before, the last tuple's first element is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, the last tuple's second element is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, and the list within the last tuple is the list from the second-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.**
