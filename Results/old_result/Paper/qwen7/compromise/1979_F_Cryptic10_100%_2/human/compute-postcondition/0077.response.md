Output State: **`p2` is appended with `v1`, `ops` remains unchanged, `vx` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet uses a conditional expression to decide which list (`p1` or `p2`) to append `v1` to. Since `p1[-1]` refers to the last element of `p1`, the condition checks if this last element is equal to `v2`. If the condition is true, `p2` is appended with `v1`; otherwise, `p1` is appended with `v1`. However, the initial state only mentions `vx` remains unchanged and `ops` must have at least one element, but does not specify the exact lists or their contents. Therefore, the output state reflects that `p2` is appended with `v1` if the condition is met, and `ops` and `vx` remain unchanged.
