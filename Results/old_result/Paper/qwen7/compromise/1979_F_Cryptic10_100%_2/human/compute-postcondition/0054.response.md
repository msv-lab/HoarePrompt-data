Output State: **`ops` is now [('v3', 0), ('v1', 0)], `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is undefined, `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` does not contain `v3`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple containing `v3` and `0`, and another tuple containing `v1` and `0` to the list `ops`. Since `ops` was initially an empty list, it is now ` [('v3', 0), ('v1', 0)]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
