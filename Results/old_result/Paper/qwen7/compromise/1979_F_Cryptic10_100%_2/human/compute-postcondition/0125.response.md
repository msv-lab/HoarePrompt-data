Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `ops` is unchanged except the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`.
- `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
- `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
- The last tuple in `ops` has its first element appended with `v1`.

### Loop Head:
```
for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable `(v1, v2)` is derived from the tuples in `ops` in reverse order.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `v1` and `v2` are taken from the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - The last tuple in `ops` has its first element modified to include `v1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `v1` and `v2` are derived from the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - The last tuple in `ops` is modified to include `v1`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - For the second iteration, the loop will take the second tuple from the reversed list.
   - The `v1` and `v2` values will be derived from this tuple.
   - The last tuple in `ops` will be further modified to include the new `v1` value from this iteration.

### Adjusted States:
- `v1` and `v2` will be updated based on the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list.
- The last tuple in `ops` will be further modified to include the new `v1` value.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ops` is unchanged except the last tuple which now has its first element appended with the new `v1` value; `v1` is the first element of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list; `v2` is the second element of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`ops` is unchanged except the last tuple which now has its first element appended with the new `v1` value; `v1` is the first element of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list; `v2` is the second element of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list.**
