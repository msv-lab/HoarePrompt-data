Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 5`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, `len(vx)` is decreased by 1, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, and `_` is the discarded return value of `q(0)`**.

Explanation: The code removes the element `v3` from the list `vx`. Since `v3` was previously determined by `q(0)`, its value remains unchanged. However, the length of `vx` decreases by 1 because an element is removed. Consequently, `v1` (which is `len(vx) - 4`) and `v2` (which is `len(vx) - 2`) also decrease by 1. The other variables remain unaffected.
