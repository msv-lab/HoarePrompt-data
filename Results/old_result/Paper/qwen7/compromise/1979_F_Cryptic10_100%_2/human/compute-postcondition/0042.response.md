Output State: **After all iterations, `ops` will be an empty list, `p1` will contain the elements of `vx` in their original order, and `p2` will contain all the elements that were appended during the iterations in reverse order of their appearance.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the `ops` list in reverse order, appending elements from the tuples to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition. Since the loop runs for as many times as there are elements in `ops`, and each iteration removes one element from `ops`, after all iterations, `ops` will be empty. The elements from `vx` start in `p1` and are moved to `p2` in reverse order due to the reverse iteration, making `p2` contain all the elements that were appended during the iterations in reverse order.
