Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` added to it, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is the second last element of the updated `vx` minus 2, `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`.**

Explanation: The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` adds a new tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
