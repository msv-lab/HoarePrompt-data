Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` is equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v2` is also equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v3` is assigned the value of `q(0)`.**

The code assigns `q(0)` to `v3`, while keeping all other variables unchanged. The precondition remains valid except for the assignment to `v3`.
