Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple unpacking `(v1, v2)` from the list `ops[::-1]`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `v1` and `v2` are the variables being unpacked from the list `ops[::-1]`.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `ops[::-1]`. This means `ops` must contain at least one tuple when the loop starts.

4. **Initial state of `ops`**: Since `ops` is a list of tuples, we need to ensure that `ops` contains at least one tuple for the loop to execute.

5. **Initial state of `v1` and `v2`**: Before the loop starts, `v1` and `v2` will be the first tuple in `ops[::-1]`. Since `ops` is a list of tuples, the first tuple in `ops[::-1]` will be the last tuple in `ops`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `ops` must contain at least one tuple.
- `v1` and `v2` will be the first tuple in `ops[::-1]`, which is the last tuple in `ops`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`**.
