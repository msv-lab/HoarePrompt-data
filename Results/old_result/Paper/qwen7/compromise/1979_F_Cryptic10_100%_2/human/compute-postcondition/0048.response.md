Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is undefined, `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`.**

Explanation: The code removes the second last element (`v1`) from the list `vx`. After the removal, `v1` is no longer defined because it was removed from the list, and `v2` now refers to the last element of the updated `vx` (which was originally the penultimate element). The list `p1` now contains all elements of `vx` except for the second last one, while `p2` remains unchanged as an empty list, and `ops` remains an empty list.
