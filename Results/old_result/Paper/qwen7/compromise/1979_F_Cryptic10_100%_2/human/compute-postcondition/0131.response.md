Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and n is an integer within the range 2 to 10^5. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function processes these test cases and returns results based on the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers t and n, and it processes these according to the specified ranges and constraints, returning appropriate outputs for each test case.
