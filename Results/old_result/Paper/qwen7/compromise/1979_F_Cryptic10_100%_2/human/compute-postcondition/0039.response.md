Output State: **`ops` contains valid tuples, the length of `ops` is one less than before, the last tuple's first element is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, the last tuple's second element is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, and the list within the last tuple is the list from the second-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.**

Explanation: The given code snippet modifies the last tuple in the `ops` list. Specifically, it checks if the last element of the first tuple (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`. If true, it appends `v1` to `p2`; otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`. However, since the last tuple's structure is described as being the same as the second-to-last tuple except for the appended `v1`, and the code does not change this structure, the output state remains as described in the initial state. The length of `ops` is reduced by one, and the last tuple retains its specified form.
