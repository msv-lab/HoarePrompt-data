Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a lambda function `q` is defined which prints '? %d' % d followed by reading a line of input and splitting it into integers, and these integers are returned as a map object.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `ops` will be an empty list, `p1` will contain the elements of `vx` in their original order, and `p2` will contain all the elements that were appended during the iterations in reverse order of their appearance.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p2` contains ['a', 'a'], `ops` remains unchanged, `vx` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ops` remains unchanged, `p2` will contain the original elements plus the cumulative appendages from each iteration of the loop, and `vx` remains as the set containing the last two integers originally in the set from 1 to n.

To explain in more detail:
- `ops` does not change because it is only being read from within the loop and no modifications are made to it.
- `p2` starts with `['a', 'a']`. For each iteration of the loop, the last element of `p1` is compared to `v2`. If they match, `v1` is appended to `p2`; otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`. Since we do not know the exact sequence of `v1` and `v2` values, `p2` will contain the original `['a', 'a']` plus any additional elements appended based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `vx` remains as the set containing the last two integers originally in the set from 1 to n, as it is not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
