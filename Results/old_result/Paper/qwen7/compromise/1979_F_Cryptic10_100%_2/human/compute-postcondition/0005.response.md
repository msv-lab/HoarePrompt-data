Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2`, `ops` is an empty list, `v1` is an integer from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from `vx` and `v1 != v2`.**

Explanation: The code removes `v1` from the set `vx`. Since `vx` originally contained integers from 1 to `t-1`, after removing `v1`, it now contains integers from 1 to `t-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
