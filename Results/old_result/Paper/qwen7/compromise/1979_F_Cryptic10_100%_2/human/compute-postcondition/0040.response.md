Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `ops` contains valid tuples.
   - The length of `ops` is one less than before.
   - The last tuple's first element (`v1`) is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - The last tuple's second element (`v2`) is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - The list within the last tuple is the list from the second-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.

2. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, which means it starts from the last tuple and moves towards the first tuple.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ops[::-1]`, the current iteration is using the last tuple of the updated `ops` list.
   - For the next iteration, we need to consider the second-to-last tuple of the updated `ops` list.

4. **Updating the State**:
   - The length of `ops` will be reduced by one more since the loop will remove another tuple.
   - The last tuple's first element (`v1`) will be the first element of the new second-to-last tuple.
   - The last tuple's second element (`v2`) will be the second element of the new second-to-last tuple.
   - The list within the last tuple will be the list from the new second-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.

5. **Final State**:
   - After the current iteration, the length of `ops` will be two less than its original length.
   - The last tuple's first element (`v1`) will be the first element of the third-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - The last tuple's second element (`v2`) will be the second element of the third-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - The list within the last tuple will be the list from the third-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ops` contains valid tuples, the length of `ops` is two less than before, the last tuple's first element is the first element of the third-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, the last tuple's second element is the second element of the third-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, and the list within the last tuple is the list from the third-to-last tuple without the appended `v1`.**
