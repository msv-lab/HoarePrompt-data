Output State: **`vx` remains unchanged, `p1` is a list containing all elements of `vx` except for the last two elements, and `p2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `p1, p2 = list(vx), []` creates a new list `p1` which is a copy of `vx` excluding its last two elements, and initializes `p2` as an empty list. Since `vx` is unchanged, `p1` now holds all elements of `vx` except for the last two, and `p2` remains an empty list as specified.
