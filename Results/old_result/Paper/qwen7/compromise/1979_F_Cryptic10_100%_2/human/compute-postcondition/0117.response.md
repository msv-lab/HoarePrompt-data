Postcondition: `v1` is `len(vx) - 5`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 1; if `v2 > 0`, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `v1` is `len(vx) - 6`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, `len(vx)` is decreased by 1, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, and `_` is the discarded return value of `q(0)`.
