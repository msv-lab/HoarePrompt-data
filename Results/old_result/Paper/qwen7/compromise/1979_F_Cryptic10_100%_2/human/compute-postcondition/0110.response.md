Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` updates the values of `v1` and `v2`. Initially, `v1` is `len(vx) - 4` and `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`. After executing the code, `v1` becomes `len(vx) - 3` and `v2` becomes `len(vx) - 2`. The precondition that `vx` has one less element than before the removal and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
