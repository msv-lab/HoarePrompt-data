Output State: **`p2` contains `['a', 'a']`, `ops` is an empty list, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n where n is an input integer greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `vx` as a set containing integers from 1 to the value of `int(input())` (which is greater than 0) and sets `ops` to an empty list. The initial values of `p2` and the condition that `ops` and `vx` remain unchanged are preserved.
