Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` is equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v2` is also equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`.**

Explanation: The code `vx.remove(v1)` removes the element `v1` from the list `vx`. Given that `v1` is defined as `q(len(vx) - 2)`, removing `v1` from `vx` reduces the length of `vx` by one. Therefore, `vx` now has at least 2 elements instead of at least 3. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
