Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v1` and `v2` from the tuple `(v1, v2)`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p2` is a list containing the elements of its original content followed by `v1`.
   - `ops` remains unchanged.
   - `vx` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `ops` in reverse order using `enumerate(ops[::-1])`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ops` in reverse, the next iteration will use the previous element in `ops`.
   - `v1` and `v2` will be the next pair of values from `ops` in reverse order.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `p2` will be updated to include the next value from `ops` in reverse order.
   - `ops` remains unchanged.
   - `vx` remains unchanged.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `p2` will now contain the elements of its original content followed by the next value from `ops` in reverse order.
- `ops` remains unchanged.
- `vx` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`p2` is now a list containing the elements of its original content followed by the next value from `ops` in reverse order, `ops` remains unchanged, `vx` remains unchanged**.
