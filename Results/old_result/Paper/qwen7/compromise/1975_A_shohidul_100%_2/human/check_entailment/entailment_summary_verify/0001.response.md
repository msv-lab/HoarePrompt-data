### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. However, there are a few points to consider that might affect the overall correctness:

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The initial check using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` is correct and ensures that if the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

2. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - The program iterates through the array to find the first position where the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is violated.
   - For each such position, it splits the array into two parts: `x = a[:i]` and `y = a[i:]`.
   - It then checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping these two parts.
     - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the second part.
     - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks if the second part is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such split satisfies the conditions, it prints 'NO'.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic used to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping parts. Specifically, the current implementation only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the second part. This is not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be made non-decreasing after the swap.

To ensure the array can be made non-decreasing, the first part (`x`) should be non-increasing and the second part (`y`) should be non-decreasing. The current implementation only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the second part, which is not a comprehensive check.

### Corrected Logic:

A more robust approach would be to check if the first part (`x`) is non-increasing and the second part (`y`) is non-decreasing. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        x = a[:i]
        y = a[i:]
        if x == sorted(x, reverse=True) and y == sorted(y):
            print('YES')
            break
else:
    print('NO')
```

This ensures that both parts meet the necessary conditions for the array to be made non-decreasing after the swap.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the need for a more comprehensive check, the original assessment is slightly inaccurate due to the incomplete logic in handling unsorted arrays.

**Final: False**
