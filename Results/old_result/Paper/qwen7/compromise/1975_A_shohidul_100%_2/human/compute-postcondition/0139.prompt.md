Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]
                    )
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all_new and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `check_all` remains unchanged from its last known state, and `i` is now equal to `n`. If `check_all` is initially True, then each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the previous one starting from index 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `new` is an empty list, `check_all_new` is `True`, and `new_all` is `True`. If all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element, `check_all` remains `True`. Otherwise, the loop will have executed all iterations and verified that no pair of consecutive elements in the remaining part of the list violates the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]`, ensuring `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is an empty list, `check_all_new` is False, and `new_all` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
