Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `new` is an empty list.
- `check_all_new` is `True`.
- `new_all` is `True`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
