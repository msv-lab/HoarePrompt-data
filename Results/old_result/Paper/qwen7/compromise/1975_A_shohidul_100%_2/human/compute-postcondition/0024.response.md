Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating if the elements in `new` from index 0 to len(new)-1 are in non-decreasing order; `new` is now a slice of `a` starting from index `i` to the end.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` which is a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. The conditions and boolean values related to `check_all_new` and `new_all` remain unchanged.
