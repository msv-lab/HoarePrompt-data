Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged.
