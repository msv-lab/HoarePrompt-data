Output: **NO**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `new` is a sublist starting from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string 'NO'. Since no other variables or conditions are evaluated within this statement, the output remains simply 'NO'.
