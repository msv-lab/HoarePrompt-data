Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, these conditions are checked and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above regardless of the if condition.
