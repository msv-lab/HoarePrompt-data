Output State: **`i` is 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3) to the end of the list. Since the initial state does not provide the actual elements of the list `a`, we can only say that `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3.
