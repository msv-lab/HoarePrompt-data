Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `new` starts from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. In both cases (whether the condition `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
