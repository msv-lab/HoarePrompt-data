Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python when the loop index is not needed) and `t`. The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `new` is an empty list.
   - `check_all_new` is `True`.
   - `new_all` is `True`.
   - If all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element, `check_all` remains `True`. Otherwise, the loop will have executed all iterations and verified that no pair of consecutive elements in the remaining part of the list violates the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]`, ensuring `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to decrease `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`n`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop itself.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 before the first iteration and will be `t - 1` for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `new` remains an empty list.
   - `check_all_new` remains `True`.
   - `new_all` remains `True`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `new` is an empty list, `check_all_new` is `True`, and `new_all` is `True`.**
