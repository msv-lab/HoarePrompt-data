Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state provides us with the value of `i` as 3.
- It also states that `n` must be greater than 3, but the specific value of `n` is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `new` is a sublist starting from `a[3]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no conditions or calculations involving `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all` are performed within the print statement itself, the output is directly `'YES'`.
