Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and it is true.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and it is true.
- The condition `check_all_new and new_all` is true.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
