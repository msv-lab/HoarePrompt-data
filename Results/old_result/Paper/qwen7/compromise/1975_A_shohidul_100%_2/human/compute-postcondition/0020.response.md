Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating if the elements in `new` from index 0 to len(new)-1 are in non-decreasing order, and in both cases (whether the condition `check_all_new` and `new_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
