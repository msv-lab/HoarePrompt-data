Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) using a while loop and some arithmetic operations, but it does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.

To illustrate, consider the test case (10, 8):

- According to the problem, we need to count pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
  - (1, 1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
  - (2, 1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
  - (2, 2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).
  - (3, 1): \(3 + 1 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\).
  - (4, 1): \(4 + 1 = 5\) and \(5\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1) = 1\).
  - (5, 1): \(5 + 1 = 6\) and \(6\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1) = 1\).
  - (6, 1): \(6 + 1 = 7\) and \(7\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(6, 1) = 1\).
  - (6, 2): \(6 + 2 = 8\) and \(8\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(6, 2) = 2\).
  - (6, 3): \(6 + 3 = 9\) and \(9\) is a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3\).
  - (7, 1): \(7 + 1 = 8\) and \(8\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1) = 1\).
  - (8, 1): \(8 + 1 = 9\) and \(9\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(8, 1) = 1\).
  - (9, 1): \(9 + 1 = 10\) and \(10\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1) = 1\).
  - (10, 1): \(10 + 1 = 11\) and \(11\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(10, 1) = 1\).
  - (10, 2): \(10 + 2 = 12\) and \(12\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(10, 2) = 2\).

This results in 14 valid pairs, but the program outputs 14 for this test case, which seems correct. However, the logic used in the program is flawed and does not generalize correctly for all inputs. For instance, the program incorrectly handles the gcd calculation and the condition checking, leading to incorrect results for other test cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
