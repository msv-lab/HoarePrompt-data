Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) + 1 + (n / 4) + 1`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. All other variables retain their initial or calculated states.
