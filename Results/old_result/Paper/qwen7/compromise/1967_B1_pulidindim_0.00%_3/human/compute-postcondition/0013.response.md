Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / count - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `g -= countmins` subtracts `countmins` (which is 1) from `g`. Given that `g` was initially `n / count`, after the subtraction, `g` becomes `n / count - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
