You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the last integer input split from `input().split()` after all iterations, `m` is the last value of `m` read from `input().split()` after all iterations, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the final accumulated sum calculated by the loop, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - m / (m + 1) + 1`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t + 1` because the loop runs `t` times, incrementing `i` from 0 to `t - 1`, and then `i` is incremented one more time after the loop finishes. The variable `count` will be equal to `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` until it is greater than `m`. The variable `ans` will contain the final accumulated sum, which is calculated by adding `g / count + 1` for each iteration from `count = 3` to `count = m + 1`. The variable `countmins` will be `m` when the loop ends. The variable `g` will be updated in the last iteration as `n / ((m + 1) * (m + 1)) - m / (m + 1) + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, and m, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6. The function returns a result based on the sum of n and m across all test cases, ensuring this sum does not exceed 2 * 10^6.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
