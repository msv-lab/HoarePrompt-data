Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) + 1`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / count - countmins`, and we subtract `countmins` from `g`.**

In this output state, the variable `g` is updated by subtracting `countmins` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
