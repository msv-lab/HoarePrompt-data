Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is the second integer input split from `input().split()`, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 + 1) + (n / 3 + 1) + ... + (n / (m - 1) + 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / m`**.

Explanation: The line `count = 2` updates the value of `count` to 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
