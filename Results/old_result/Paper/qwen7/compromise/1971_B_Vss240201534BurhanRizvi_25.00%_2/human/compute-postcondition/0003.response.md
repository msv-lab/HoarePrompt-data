Functionality: **For each test case defined by the input integer `t`, the function reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters and checks if `s` can be shuffled to form a different string. If a different shuffled version exists, it prints 'Yes' followed by the shuffled string; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function processes up to 1000 test cases.**
