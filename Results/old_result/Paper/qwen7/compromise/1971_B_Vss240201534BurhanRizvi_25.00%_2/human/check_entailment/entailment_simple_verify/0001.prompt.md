You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: For each test case, either 'Yes' followed by a randomly shuffled version of the input string or 'No' is printed. The exact output depends on the input string for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is different from `s`. If no such rearrangement is possible, the program should output "NO".

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.
   - It then generates a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s` using `random.sample`.
   - If `s` is not equal to `s2`, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s` is equal to `s2`, it prints "No".

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of `s`, ensuring that `s2` is a different permutation of `s` with high probability.
   - However, there is a potential issue: if the original string `s` has repeated characters, there might be cases where `s` and `s2` are the same due to the limited number of permutations.

4. **Edge Case Consideration**:
   - For strings with all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the shuffled version will always be the same as the original string because there is only one unique permutation.
   - The program correctly handles this edge case by printing "No" when `s == s2`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where all characters are identical.
   - For other cases, the program attempts to generate a different permutation and outputs "Yes" followed by the new string `s2` if successful.
   - The logic is sound and covers the required functionality as per the problem statement.
