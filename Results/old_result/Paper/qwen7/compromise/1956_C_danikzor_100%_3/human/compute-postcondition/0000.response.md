Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the input operation only affects `n`. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 to 500, and `n` is now an integer input from the user.
