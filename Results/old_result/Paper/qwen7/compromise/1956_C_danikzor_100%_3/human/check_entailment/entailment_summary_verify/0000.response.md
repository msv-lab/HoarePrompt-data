### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Calculation and Output**:
   - The program calculates and prints a specific mathematical expression \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4 \cdot n - 1)}{6} \) and \( 2 \cdot n \).
   - It then prints \( 2 \cdot n \) lines, each starting with either 1 or 2, followed by an integer \( i \) (where \( 1 \leq i \leq n \)), and the numbers from \( n \) down to 1 in descending order.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes a single test case and prints the required output. It does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
   - The printed permutations are not optimal for maximizing the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the same permutation is applied to both rows and columns, which is not the correct approach to maximize the sum.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. The provided permutations do not ensure that the sum of the matrix is maximized.
   - The mathematical expression \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4 \cdot n - 1)}{6} \) is not relevant to the problem and does not contribute to the correct solution.
   - The program does not generate the optimal permutations for each row and column independently, which is necessary to achieve the maximum sum.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix and does not follow the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not generate the optimal permutations for each row and column independently, leading to a suboptimal solution.
