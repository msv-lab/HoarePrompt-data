### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix \(a\) using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It then prints the maximum possible sum and the number of operations required.
   - It performs \(2n\) operations, each setting the entire row or column to a permutation of numbers from \(n\) down to 1.

3. **Formula for Maximum Sum**:
   - The formula provided in the program is \( n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6 \), which is incorrect.
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum when filling the matrix with values \( n+1-i-j \) is \( n * (n + 1) * (n + 1) / 2 \).

4. **Operation Analysis**:
   - The program sets each row and each column to a permutation of numbers from \(n\) down to 1. This does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - To maximize the sum, we should consider permuting the rows and columns in a way that maximizes the sum. For example, setting the first row to \([1, 2, ..., n]\) and the first column to \([1, 2, ..., n]\) would be more effective.

5. **Correctness of the Given Program**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum.
   - The operations performed do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum. The intended operations should involve permuting the rows and columns to maximize the sum, not just setting each row or column to a descending sequence.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect, and the operations performed do not achieve the maximum sum.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
