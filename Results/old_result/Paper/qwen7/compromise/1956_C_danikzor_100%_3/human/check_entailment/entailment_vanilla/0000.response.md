Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix \( a \) using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
3. The given program attempts to fill the matrix in such a way that each cell \( a_{i,j} \) is assigned the value \( n+1-i-j \). This approach aims to distribute values in a manner that maximizes the sum of the matrix.
4. Let's analyze the output of the program:
   - For each test case, it prints the maximum possible sum and the number of operations required.
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations, each setting the entire row or column to a permutation of numbers from \( n \) down to 1.
5. However, the formula used to calculate the maximum sum \( n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6 \) is incorrect. The correct formula for the maximum sum when filling the matrix with values \( n+1-i-j \) is \( n * (n + 1) * (n + 1) / 2 \).
6. Additionally, while the program correctly outputs \( 2n \) operations, these operations do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum. The intended operations should involve permuting the rows and columns to maximize the sum, not just setting each row or column to a descending sequence.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
