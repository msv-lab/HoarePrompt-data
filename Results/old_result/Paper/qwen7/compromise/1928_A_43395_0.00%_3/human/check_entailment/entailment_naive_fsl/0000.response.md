Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 4`

According to the problem description, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and then these two 2x2 rectangles can be combined to form a 4x2 rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs "no" for this case.

The issue lies in the conditions used to determine if another rectangle can be formed:
1. The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` checks if both dimensions are even, which is not sufficient.
2. The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and do not properly check if the dimensions can be split and recombined.
3. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is also incorrect and does not make sense in this context.

A correct approach would involve checking if either dimension is divisible by the other, as this ensures that the rectangle can be split and recombined into another valid rectangle.
