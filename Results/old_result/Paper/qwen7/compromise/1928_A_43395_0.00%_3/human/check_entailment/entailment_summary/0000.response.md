Reasoning:
1. The program should determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions \(a \times b\).
2. The logic in the program needs to be analyzed to see if it correctly implements the rules provided in the problem statement.
3. The program checks three main conditions:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it prints 'yes'.
   - If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) equals \(-a\) or \(-b\), it prints 'no'.
   - If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it prints 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

Let's analyze these conditions:
- **Condition 1:** If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it means we can always cut the rectangle into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form another rectangle. For example, a \(4 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into \(2 \times 6\) and \(2 \times 6\), and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
- **Condition 2:** If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) equals \(-a\) or \(-b\), it implies that one dimension is exactly double the other. In such cases, cutting the rectangle will result in two identical smaller rectangles, and no new distinct rectangle can be formed. For example, a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle can only be cut into \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle.
- **Condition 3:** If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it suggests that one dimension is an odd number more than the other, and thus, the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle. For example, a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into \(3 \times 1\) and \(3 \times 1\), and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.
- **Otherwise:** If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'no', which is incorrect according to the problem statement. For example, a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle should print 'no' based on the given conditions, but the program incorrectly prints 'no' for other cases where it should print 'yes'.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
