Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The value of `i` is determined by the expression `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to the first input value, and the loop will continue until `i` reaches `t`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is given as a positive integer within the specified range, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that the first input value (which sets `i`) is valid and within the range \(1 \leq i < t\).

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of the first input, which sets `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the first input value must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq i < t\)**.
