Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are both digits and letters in the password, and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order. Specifically, the program checks if the digits are sorted correctly but does not ensure that the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order before concatenating them with the sorted digits. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the password "123abc":

- The program sorts the digits [1, 2, 3] to [1, 2, 3].
- It sorts the letters ['a', 'b', 'c'] to ['a', 'b', 'c'].
- It then concatenates these sorted parts to form "123abc".
- However, according to the problem description, the letters should also be sorted, which they are in this case, but the program does not check this explicitly before concatenation.

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure that the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order before concatenating them with the sorted digits. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

With this correction, the program will properly validate that both the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
