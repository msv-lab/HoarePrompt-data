You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a password string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the digits and letters into two lists, sorts them, and then checks if the sorted concatenation of these lists matches the original password. If they match, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are both digits and letters in the password, and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order. Specifically, the program checks if the digits are sorted correctly but does not ensure that the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order before concatenating them with the sorted digits. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the password "123abc":

- The program sorts the digits [1, 2, 3] to [1, 2, 3].
- It sorts the letters ['a', 'b', 'c'] to ['a', 'b', 'c'].
- It then concatenates these sorted parts to form "123abc".
- However, according to the problem description, the letters should also be sorted, which they are in this case, but the program does not check this explicitly before concatenation.

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure that the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order before concatenating them with the sorted digits. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

With this correction, the program will properly validate that both the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
