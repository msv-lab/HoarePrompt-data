### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It separates the characters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It checks if any digit is greater than the next digit, which ensures digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if any letter is greater than the last digit, ensuring no digit comes after a letter.
   - It concatenates the sorted digits and letters and compares the result with the original password to ensure the password meets the criteria.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters.
   - The sorting and comparison logic correctly validate the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the validation logic for the password strength criteria.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description.
