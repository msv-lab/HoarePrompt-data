Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for char in password:`. The objects involved here are `char`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `digits` is an empty list.
   - `letters` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in `password`. For the loop to execute at least once, `password` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each character in `password`, `password` must have at least one character for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The loop variable `char` will take on the value of each character in `password` during each iteration, starting from the first character.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `password` must have at least one character (since the loop will execute at least once).
- `char` will be set to the first character of `password` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character in `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**.
