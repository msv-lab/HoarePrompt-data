Output State: **`password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `digits` is a list of sorted digits from the original `password`; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` in the order they appeared.**

Explanation: The code `digits.sort()` sorts the list `digits` in ascending order. The other variables (`password` and `letters`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the `digits` list now contains its elements sorted, while `password` and `letters` retain their original properties and order.
