Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `t` is decreased by 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at `n-1` and the loop continues as long as `j < n`, the next value of `j` will be `n-2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the loop itself does not modify `n`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `cnt` remains the same because the loop body is omitted and no operations affect `cnt`.
   - `i` remains 1 because the loop body does not modify `i`.
   - `j` becomes `n-2`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `t` is decreased by 1.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify these lists.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cnt` is 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input**.
