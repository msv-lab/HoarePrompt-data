Output State: **`cnt` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `n-1`, and `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The other variables (`cnt`, `t`, `n`, `b`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
