Output State: **`cnt` is 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `i` is 3, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is further decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
