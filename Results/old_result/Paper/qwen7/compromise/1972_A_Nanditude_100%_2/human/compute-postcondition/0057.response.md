Output State: **`cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than `a[0]`, `i` will be equal to `n` if all elements in `b` are greater than or equal to `a[0]` otherwise it will be the index of the last element in `b` that is less than `a[0]`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `cnt`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `a` is created and populated with the integers from the input.
