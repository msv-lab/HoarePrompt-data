Output State: **`cnt` is 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
