Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
