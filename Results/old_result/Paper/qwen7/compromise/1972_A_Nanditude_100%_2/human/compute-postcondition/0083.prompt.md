Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `cnt` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `n-1`. The value of `cnt` is determined by how many times the condition `b[j] < a[i]` was true during the loop's execution. If the condition was never true, `cnt` remains 0. If it was true at least once but `i` did not reach `n` before the end of the loop, `cnt` will be between 1 and `n-1`. If `i` reaches `n` before the end of the loop, `cnt` will be `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `cnt` will be the count of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` when `i` was initially 0. `i` will be equal to `n` if all elements in `b` are greater than or equal to `a[i]`, otherwise it will be the index of the last element in `b` that is less than `a[i]`. `j` will be equal to `n-1`, and `n` will remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `cnt` is equal to `n` if for every `j` in the range of `n`, `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`. Otherwise, `cnt` is equal to the number of times `b[j]` was less than `a[i]`. `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by the number of iterations (`n`), `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will count how many times an element in list `b` was less than the current value of `i` (which ends up being `n` after the loop). The variable `j` will be `-1` because it starts from `n-1` and is decremented until it reaches `-1`. The variable `i` will be `n` after all iterations since it is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
