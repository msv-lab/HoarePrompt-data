Output State: `cnt` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `n-1`. After the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt` will have been incremented based on the condition `if b[j] < a[i]`, and `i` will be set to `n` once the loop finishes. The value of `j` will be `n-1` at the end of the last iteration.
