Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The conditions for incrementing `i` and the value of `j` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `j + 1` also remains valid.
