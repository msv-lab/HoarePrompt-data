Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is greater than the product of `m` and `n`. In such cases, the program incorrectly assumes that the number of blocks (`q`) is always less than or equal to the length of the sorted list `M`.

Consider the following test case:
```
5 10 11
1 2 3 4 5
```
- Here, `n = 5`, `m = 10`, and `k = 11`.
- The program calculates `q = int(math.ceil(k / m)) = int(math.ceil(11 / 10)) = 2`.
- It then takes the first two elements of the sorted list `M` (which are `[1, 2]`), but since `k > m * q`, it should handle this case differently.

The program does not correctly adjust its logic to handle the situation where `k` exceeds `m * q`. Specifically, it should account for the remaining tickets after forming complete blocks of `m` tickets each day. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the total cost.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `k` is not fully divisible by `m` and ensure that the remaining tickets are purchased optimally.
