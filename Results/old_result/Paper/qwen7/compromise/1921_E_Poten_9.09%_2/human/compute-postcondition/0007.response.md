Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) within specific constraints. It returns a value based on whether x_a equals x_b or y_a equals y_b. If neither condition is met, it returns a specific outcome.**

This means the function is designed to take six integers as input indirectly through some other mechanism (not shown in the provided code snippet), and it checks if the coordinates (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) are either in the same row (x_a == x_b) or the same column (y_a == y_b). If neither condition is true, the function returns a specific value, though the exact return value when neither condition is met is not specified in the given information.
