Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The other conditions and lists remain unchanged, but since no further operations are performed on them within the given code snippet, they retain their initial state.
