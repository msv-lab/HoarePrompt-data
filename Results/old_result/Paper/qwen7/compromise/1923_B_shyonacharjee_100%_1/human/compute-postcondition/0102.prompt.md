Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
    bullets_used = 0
    can_survive = True
    for pos, health in monsters:
        distance = abs(pos)
        total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
        if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
            can_survive = False
            break
        bullets_used += health
    print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All monsters have been processed, `can_survive` is `False`, and `bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all monsters.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All monsters have been processed, `can_survive` is `False`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters, and `monsters` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all the tuples in the `monsters` list, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain all the tuples initially present in the list, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` of the last tuple in the `monsters` list, and `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and the `health` of the last tuple in the `monsters` list.

This final state occurs because the loop continues to iterate over each tuple in the `monsters` list, updating `bullets_used` with the cumulative sum of the `health` values until it either breaks out of the loop (which does not happen based on the given conditions) or encounters a condition where `total_bullets_needed` exceeds `distance * k`. Since `can_survive` is set to `False` in the first iteration and remains unchanged, the loop will continue to run through all tuples in the `monsters` list, summing up their `health` values into `bullets_used`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
