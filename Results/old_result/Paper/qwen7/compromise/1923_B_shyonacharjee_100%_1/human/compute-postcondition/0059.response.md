Output State: **`bullets_used` is increased by `health`, `health` is the health of the next monster, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` retains its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

The code calculates the distance between the current position (`pos`) and the next monster's position. This distance is stored in the variable `distance`, which is set to the absolute value of `pos`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
