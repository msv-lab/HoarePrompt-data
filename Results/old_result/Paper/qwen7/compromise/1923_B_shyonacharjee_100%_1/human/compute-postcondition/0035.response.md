Output State: **`can_survive` is `False`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all monsters, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The values of `can_survive` and `bullets_used` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `can_survive` is still `False`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all monsters, and `n` and `k` are the input integers.
