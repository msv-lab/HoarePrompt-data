Output State: **`bullets_used` is increased by `health`, `health` is the health of the next monster, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `can_survive` is False.**

Explanation: The line `can_survive = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `can_survive`. None of the other variables (`bullets_used`, `health`, `pos`, `total_bullets_needed`, `distance`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
