Output State: **`can_survive` is `False`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is an empty list, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `x`. The values of `can_survive`, `bullets_used`, `n`, `k`, and `monsters` remain unchanged from their initial states.
