Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is the `health` value from the second tuple in the list, `pos` is the first element of the second tuple in the list, `health` is the second element of the second tuple in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the new `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`.**

Explanation: The line `can_survive = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `can_survive`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `bullets_used`, `pos`, `health`, `distance`, and `total_bullets_needed` remain unchanged from their initial states.
