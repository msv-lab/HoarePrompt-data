Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is the `health` value from the second tuple in the list, `pos` is the first element of the second tuple in the list, `health` is the second element of the second tuple in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the new `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program has broken out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was in. All other variables retain their initial states relative to the second tuple in the list.
