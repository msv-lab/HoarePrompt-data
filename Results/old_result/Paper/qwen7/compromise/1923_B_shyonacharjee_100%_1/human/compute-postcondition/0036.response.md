Output State: **`can_survive` is `False`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all monsters, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. The initial values of `can_survive`, `bullets_used`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
