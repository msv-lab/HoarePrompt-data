Output State: **`bullets_used` is increased by the health of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` is `False`, and `distance` is set to `abs(pos)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variables `bullets_used`, `total_bullets_needed`, `can_survive`, and `distance` retain their initial conditions, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
