Postcondition: **`bullets_used` is `2 * health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least three tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of the next `pos` in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`.**
