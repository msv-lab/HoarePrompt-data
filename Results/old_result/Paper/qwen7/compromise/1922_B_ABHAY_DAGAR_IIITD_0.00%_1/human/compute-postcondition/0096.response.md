Output State: **`res` is `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `cnt`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to the current value of `res`. Since `total_count` is equal to `cnt`, the updated value of `res` becomes `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
