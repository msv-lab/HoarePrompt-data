Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `cnt` (which takes the value from `num_of_lens.values()`) and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`. This means `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute. The other variables (`res`, `total_count`, `num_list`, and `test_cases`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `num_of_lens` having at least one key-value pair.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0**
