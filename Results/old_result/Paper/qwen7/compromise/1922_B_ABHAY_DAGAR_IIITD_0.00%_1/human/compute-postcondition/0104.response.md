Output State: **`res` is updated to `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is incremented by `new_cnt`, `num_list` remains an empty list, and `test_cases` remains 0.**

Explanation: The code `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` updates the value of `res` based on the current value of `cnt` and `total_count`. Since the initial postcondition specifies that `res` is updated under certain conditions, and now the code directly modifies `res` using `cnt` and `total_count`, the updated value of `res` is `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `num_list`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
