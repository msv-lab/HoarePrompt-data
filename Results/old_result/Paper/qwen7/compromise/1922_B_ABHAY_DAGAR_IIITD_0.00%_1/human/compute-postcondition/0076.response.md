Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `num_list`. `res` will be the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, which in this case seems to be the total count of all elements in `num_of_lens`. `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, representing the total number of elements in `num_list`. `num_list` will be an empty list since it is modified within the loop by iterating through its elements. `test_cases` will be decremented by the number of iterations, which is equal to the length of `num_list`.

In Natural Language: After the loop completes all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`. The variable `res` will hold the total count of all elements in `num_of_lens`. `total_count` will also reflect the total count of all elements in `num_of_lens`. `num_list` will be empty because it has been fully iterated over. `test_cases` will be reduced by the number of elements in `num_list`.
