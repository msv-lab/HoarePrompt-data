Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `cnt` which is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `cnt`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are values in `num_of_lens`.
   - `cnt` is derived from `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
   - `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`.
   - `num_list` is an empty list.
   - `test_cases` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `cnt` is derived from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, the loop can continue.
   - For the next iteration, `cnt` will be the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `total_count` will be updated by adding the new `cnt` to it.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `num_of_lens` will still have at least one key-value pair, but `cnt` will be the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `total_count` will be updated by adding the new `cnt` to it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.** 

However, since `cnt` is changing, we need to specify the new `cnt` value. Let's denote the new `cnt` as `new_cnt`.

State: **`res` is `2 * res + new_cnt * (new_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + new_cnt`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.**
