Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the key `x` with a value of 2, and `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element, and the next element in `num_list` is `x`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by 1. Given that the initial value of `num_of_lens[x]` is either 1 or 3, after incrementing it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
