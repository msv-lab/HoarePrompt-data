Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of `res` values calculated for each test case. For each test case, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the corresponding `num_list`. The `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for that test case. The `res` variable will hold the cumulative sum of contributions calculated according to the conditions given for each test case. `n` and `test_cases` will remain as they were initialized, and `num_list` will be an empty list for each test case.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `results` list will contain one element for each test case, where each element represents the final value of `res` for that specific test case. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will store the frequency of numbers in the input lists for each test case, and `total_count` will be the sum of these frequencies. The `res` variable will accumulate the result based on the given conditions over all test cases.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: 

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - Since the loop is iterating over the `results` list, the next element in the list will be assigned to `result` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the `result` variable will be updated to the next element in the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `result`, which will be set to the next element in the `results` list.

### Final Answer:
State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `result` is the next element in the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
