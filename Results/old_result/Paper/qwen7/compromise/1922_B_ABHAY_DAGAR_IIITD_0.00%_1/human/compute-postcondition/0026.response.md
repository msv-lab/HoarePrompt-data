Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `cnt`**: Since `cnt` is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`, the first value of `cnt` will be one of the counts in `num_of_lens`.

3. **Check the initial state of `num_of_lens`**: The state before the loop starts is given as `num_of_lens` being a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: To ensure the loop can execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one value. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` is not empty.

5. **Consider other relevant states**: The other variables (`results`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num_of_lens` must have at least one value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value**
