Output State: **`res` is `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `total_count` is the original value of `total_count` plus `cnt`.
