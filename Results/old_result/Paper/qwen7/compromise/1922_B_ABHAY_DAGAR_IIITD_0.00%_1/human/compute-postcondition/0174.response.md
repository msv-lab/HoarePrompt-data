Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The function returns a value based on the input tuples, but the specific return value is not detailed here.**

This means the function processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes the number of sticks and their corresponding exponents. The function then performs some operation based on this input but the exact nature of the operation and the return value are not specified in the given information.
