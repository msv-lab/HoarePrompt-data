Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is 0, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `cnt`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total_count` is incremented by `cnt`, `res` is updated to either `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or remains as `2 * res + new_cnt * (new_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is less than 2, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `num_list` remains an empty list, and `test_cases` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
