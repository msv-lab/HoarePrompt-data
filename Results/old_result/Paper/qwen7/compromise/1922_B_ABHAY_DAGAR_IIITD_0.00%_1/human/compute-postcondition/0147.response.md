Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `total_count` is calculated based on `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.
   - `res` is calculated based on `cnt` and `total_count`.
   - `num_list`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.
   - `n` remains the same as it was provided initially.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `total_count` will be updated based on the new value of `cnt`.
   - `res` will be recalculated based on the new value of `cnt` and the updated `total_count`.
   - `num_of_lens` will lose one key-value pair since we are iterating over its values.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `total_count` will be updated based on the new value of `cnt`.
- `res` will be recalculated based on the new value of `cnt` and the updated `total_count`.
- `num_of_lens` will have one less key-value pair.

Since we don't know the exact value of `cnt` from the previous iteration, we can represent the new state in a general form.

**State:**
- `total_count` is `cnt` + 0 (assuming the same calculation as before).
- `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair minus one.
- `res` is either `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 if `cnt` is less than 2.
- `num_list` remains an empty list.
- `test_cases` remains 0.
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`.
- `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total_count` is `cnt` + 0, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair minus one, `res` is either `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 if `cnt` is less than 2, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**
