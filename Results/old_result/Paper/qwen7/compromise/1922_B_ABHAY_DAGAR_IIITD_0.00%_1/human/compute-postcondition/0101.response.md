Output State: **`res` is `3 * res + new_cnt * (new_cnt - 1) * (new_cnt - 2) // 6`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + new_cnt`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.**

Explanation: The initial value of `res` is given by `2 * res + new_cnt * (new_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. After executing the line `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since the exact value of `cnt` is not specified, we express the new value of `res` as `3 * res + new_cnt * (new_cnt - 1) * (new_cnt - 2) // 6`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `num_list`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.
