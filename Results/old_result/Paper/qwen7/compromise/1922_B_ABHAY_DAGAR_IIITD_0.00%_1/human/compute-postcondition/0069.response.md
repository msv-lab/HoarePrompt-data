Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is now 1, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `x` is the next integer in `num_list`, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of `num_of_lens[x]` to 1 if `x` was not previously a key in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since `x` is the next integer in `num_list`, the dictionary `num_of_lens` now has `x` as a key with a count of 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
