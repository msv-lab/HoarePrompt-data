Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in num_list:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - For each value of `x` in `num_list`, the postcondition updates either the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` or initializes `num_of_lens[x]` to 1 if `x` is not already present.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `num_list`, the value of `x` changes with each iteration.
   - The set `num_of_lens` is updated based on the current value of `x`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, its count is increased by 1.
   - If `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, it is added with a count of 1.

5. **Next iteration**:
   - The next value of `x` will be the next element in `num_list`.
   - Therefore, `x` will change to the next element in `num_list`.
   - `num_of_lens` will be updated according to the new value of `x`.

Given these points, we can conclude:

- The value of `x` will change to the next element in `num_list`.
- `num_of_lens` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` and the updated state of `num_of_lens` depend on the specific elements in `num_list`, we can only say that `x` will be the next element in `num_list` and `num_of_lens` will be updated accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is the next integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is updated such that the count of `x` is increased by 1 if it is already in `num_of_lens`, or `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1 if it is not in `num_of_lens`**.
