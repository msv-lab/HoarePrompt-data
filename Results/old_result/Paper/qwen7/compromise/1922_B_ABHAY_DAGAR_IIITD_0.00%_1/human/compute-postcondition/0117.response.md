Output State: **`x` is an integer in the set `num_of_lens`; `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by 1. Since `x` was initially in the set `num_of_lens`, it remains in the set. The exact value of `num_of_lens[x]` is not specified, but it is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
