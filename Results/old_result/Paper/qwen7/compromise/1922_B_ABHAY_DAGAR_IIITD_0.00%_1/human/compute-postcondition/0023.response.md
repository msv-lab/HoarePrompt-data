Output State: `results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, and `num_list` is a list of integers that has been fully iterated over.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` remains an empty list since it is not modified within the loop. The `num_of_lens` dictionary contains the frequency count of each integer present in `num_list`. This means for every unique integer in `num_list`, there is a corresponding entry in `num_of_lens` where the key is the integer and the value is how many times that integer appears in `num_list`. The `num_list` itself is unchanged from its initial state but has been fully processed by the loop.
