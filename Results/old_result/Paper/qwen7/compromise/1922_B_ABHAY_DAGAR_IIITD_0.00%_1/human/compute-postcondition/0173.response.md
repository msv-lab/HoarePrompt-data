Output State: **The `results` list will contain the final value of `res` for each test case after all iterations of the loop have finished.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `results` list will contain one element for each test case, where each element represents the final value of `res` for that specific test case. The loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each element, but it does not modify any of the elements or introduce new ones. Therefore, the `results` list will have been populated with the final `res` values for all test cases by the end of the loop.
