Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value `1`, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `x` is the first element of `num_list`, where `x` is not in `num_of_lens`**.

This means that the dictionary `num_of_lens` now contains the key `x` with a value of `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
