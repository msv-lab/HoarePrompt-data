Output State: **`total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer in `num_list`, `res` is the cumulative sum of `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 for all `cnt` >= 3, plus `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` for all `cnt` >= 2, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

To explain this in more detail:
- The variable `total_count` will accumulate the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` because it increments by each value in `num_of_lens` during each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `res` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop. For each count (`cnt`) in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` will be incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Similarly, for each count where `cnt` is 2 or more, `res` will be incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
- The variable `num_list` remains an empty list as there are no operations that add or modify its contents within the loop.
- The variable `test_cases` remains 0 as it is not mentioned in the loop and no operations are performed on it.
- The variable `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after the loop completes.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer provided initially and is not modified by the loop.
