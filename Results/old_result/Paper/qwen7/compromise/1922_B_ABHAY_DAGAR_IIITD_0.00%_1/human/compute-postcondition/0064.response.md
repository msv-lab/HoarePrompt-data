Output State: **`num_of_lens` is now {'x': 1}, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `x` is an integer in `num_list`, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1, with `x` not in `num_of_lens`**.

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by setting the key `x` to the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `test_cases` is decremented by 1, and `x` is confirmed to be an element of `num_list` that was not previously in `num_of_lens`.
