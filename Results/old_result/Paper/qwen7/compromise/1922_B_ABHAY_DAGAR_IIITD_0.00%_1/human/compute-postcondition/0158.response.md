Output State: **`total_count` is `cnt` + 2, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is now `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * (`cnt` + 1) + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

Explanation: The line `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` adds the product of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to the current value of `res`. The value of `total_count` is `cnt + 2`, so the updated value of `res` becomes the original value plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
