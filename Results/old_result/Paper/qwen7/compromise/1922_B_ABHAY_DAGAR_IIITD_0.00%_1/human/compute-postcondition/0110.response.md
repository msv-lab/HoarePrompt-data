Output State: **`res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` remains an empty list, and `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`**.

Explanation: The given code snippet appends the final value of `res` to the list `results`. Since `res` accumulates the results based on the conditions provided in the loop body, appending `res` to `results` does not change its value. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `num_list`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `results` which contains the final value of `res`.
