Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. A non-degenerate triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

2. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation does not check if the selected three sticks can form a triangle. Instead, it calculates combinations based on the frequency of each exponent value without considering the triangle inequality condition.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The code calculates combinations based on the frequency of each exponent value, which does not take into account whether these exponents can actually form a triangle. For example, if there are multiple sticks with the same length, the code incorrectly counts combinations that do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

4. **Expected Solution**: To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
   - Read the input values.
   - Use a data structure (like a dictionary) to count the frequency of each exponent.
   - Iterate through the possible combinations of three different exponents and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality.
   - Count the valid combinations.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to check the triangle inequality condition.

Correctness: **False**
