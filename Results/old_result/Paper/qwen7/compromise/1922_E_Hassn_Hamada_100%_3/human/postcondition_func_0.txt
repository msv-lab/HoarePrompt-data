The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a sequence of numbers based on `number` and modifies `sequence` accordingly. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and appends a sequence of numbers to `sequence` based on this pair. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated `number` and `sequence` values. The function ultimately returns two zeros.
