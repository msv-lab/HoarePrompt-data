You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values, both of which are 0.
    #State: number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The value of number is not 0
    size_overlap = 0, 0
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
        
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = size, i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `size_overlap` is (12, 0), `number` is at least 128, `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` is 0, `size` is 12, and `value` is 1022.
    #
    #This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `size_overlap` will be set to (12, 0) because the loop continues to increment `size` until it reaches its maximum possible value given the constraints, which in this case is 12 when `i` is 0 and `number` is at least 128. The `value` calculated during the final iteration is 1022, and since `i` is now 0, no further changes occur to `size_overlap`.
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 11, `size - overlap` is 12, `sequence` contains the values `overlap`, `i + overlap`, `i + 2 * overlap`, ..., `i + 11 * overlap`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which means it will run 12 times since `size` is 12 and `overlap` is 0. After 12 iterations, `i` will be 11. During each iteration, the value `i + overlap` is appended to `sequence`. Since `overlap` is 0, the sequence will contain `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `11`.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `number`, which is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and another parameter `sequence`, which is a list of integers where all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function returns two values, both of which are 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns two values, both of which are 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
