Output State: `size_overlap` is (12, 0), `sequence` must be non-negative, `number` must be at least 128, and no changes to `size` and `i`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final values of `size` and `i` are 12 and 0, respectively, due to the loop's decrementing nature. The condition `while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` continues to hold until `size` reaches 12 and `i` reaches 0. Given that `number` must be at least 128 for the loop to run through all iterations, the final state of `size_overlap` is (12, 0).
