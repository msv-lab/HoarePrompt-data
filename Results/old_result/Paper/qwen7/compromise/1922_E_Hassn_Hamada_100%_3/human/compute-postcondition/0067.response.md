Output State: **`i` is 11, `size - overlap` is 12, `sequence` contains the values `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `11`, and `func_1` is called with arguments `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and `sequence`**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is called with two arguments. The first argument is calculated as `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`. Given that `size - overlap` is 12, we know `size` is 12 and `overlap` is 0. Therefore, `(1 << size)` is \(2^{12} = 4096\) and `(1 << overlap)` is \(2^0 = 1\). So the first argument becomes `number - 4096 + 1 = number - 4095`. The second argument is the `sequence` which contains the values `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `11`. The values of `i` and `size - overlap` remain unchanged.
