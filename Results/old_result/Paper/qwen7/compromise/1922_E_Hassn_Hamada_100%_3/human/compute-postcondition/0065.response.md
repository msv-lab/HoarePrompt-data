Output State: `i` is 11, `size - overlap` is 12, `sequence` contains the values `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `11`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which in this case is from `i = 0` to `i = 11`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 11. The `size - overlap` remains 12 as it does not change within the loop. The `sequence` list starts with `overlap` (which is 0) and then appends `i + overlap` for each iteration of `i` from 0 to 11, resulting in a sequence containing the numbers from 0 to 11.
