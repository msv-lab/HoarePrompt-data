Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the function `max(sequence, default=0)`. Since the function call does not directly reference any external variables, we focus on the variables `i` and the result of `max(sequence, default=0)`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i` in the range from `max(sequence, default=0)` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `max(sequence, default=0)`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `size` is 7
   - `i` is 7
   - `number` is at least 14
   - `value` is 127
   - `size_overlap` is (7, 7)

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 7.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than or equal to `max(sequence, default=0)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 7, `max(sequence, default=0)` must be less than or equal to 7 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be decreased by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 6.
   - `max(sequence, default=0)` remains unchanged from the previous iteration's context, but it must still satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should reflect `i` being 6 and `max(sequence, default=0)` remaining within the same constraints.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`size` is 7, `i` is 6, `number` is at least 14, `value` is 127, and `size_overlap` is (7, 7)**.
