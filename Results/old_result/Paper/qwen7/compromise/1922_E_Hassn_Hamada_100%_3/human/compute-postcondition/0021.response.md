Postcondition: **`size_overlap` remains (2, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 2, `size` is `i` + 3, and if `value` is less than or equal to `number`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if statement.**
