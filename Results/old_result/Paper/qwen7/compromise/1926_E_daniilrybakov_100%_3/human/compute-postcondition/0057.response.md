Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is in. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `n` and `x` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
