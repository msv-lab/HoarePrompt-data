Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5⋅10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2 + x`, `m` is 8, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: 
- The initial state includes `t` being greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5⋅10^4, `n` being `n // 2`, `k` as an input integer, `s` as `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2 + x`, `m` as 4, and `x` as `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`.
- The code `m *= 2` multiplies the value of `m` by 2, changing its value from 4 to 8.
- No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
