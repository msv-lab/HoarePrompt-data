State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Additionally, the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4`, meaning `t` must be within this range.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted since there are no other variables mentioned in the loop head besides `_` (which is just a placeholder) and `t`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute, which is `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 ⋅ 10^4.
