Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`; `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n` and `x`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `n` and `x` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
