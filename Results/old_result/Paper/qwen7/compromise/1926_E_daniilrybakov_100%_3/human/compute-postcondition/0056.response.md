Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is now divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest whole number. The value of `x` remains unchanged because the code only modifies `n` and does not reassign `x`. Initially, `x` was defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, so its value depends on the new value of `n`.
