Output State: **`t` is 5, `m` is 1, `x` is 3, `n` is an input integer divided by 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is an input integer divided by 2 and must be non-zero, `x` will be calculated based on the value of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `m`, `x` with its original value, `n`, `k`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
