Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` will eventually become 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `m` will be `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` at the last iteration.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. In each iteration, `n` is halved (`n //= 2`), `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is incremented by `x`, and `m` is doubled (`m *= 2`). This process repeats until `n` becomes 0. At this point, `s` will be the sum of all `x` values from each iteration, `m` will be `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations, and `n` will be 0.
