Output State: **`s2` is a string containing the character `i`, `s` is a string of length `m-1` starting with the second character of the original `s`, and `i` is the third character of the original `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s2 += i` appends the character `i` (which is the third character of the original `s`) to the string `s2`. The initial state of `s` and `i` remains unchanged, and `s2` starts as an empty string and gets the character `i` appended to it.
