Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is True, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1**.

The code `not_c = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `not_c`. The initial state of `A` and `set_` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `not_c` and retains the original values of `A` and `set_`.
