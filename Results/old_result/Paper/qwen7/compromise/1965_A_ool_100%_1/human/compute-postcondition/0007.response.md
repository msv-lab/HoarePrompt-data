Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 (since the range is specified as `range(1, len(set_))`).
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`.

Given the initial state:
- `A` is False
- `not_c` is True
- `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1

The key objects to consider for adjusting the state are `i` and `set_`.

To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be initialized to 1 and `set_` must contain at least one element. Since the first element of `set_` is 1, `set_` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be 1
- `set_` must have at least one element (which it does, since the first element is 1)

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is True, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order that must have at least one element, `i` is 1**
