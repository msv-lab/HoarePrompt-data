Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`arr`), and then calls the function `func_1` to determine the winner.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function first creates a list of unique elements from `arr` and sorts them. This step is correct.
   - If the smallest element in the sorted list is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. This is correct because if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always reduce the piles to a state where the smallest pile is 1, forcing Bob into a losing position.
   - The function then checks if the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list are all 1. If they are, it toggles a boolean variable `A`. This logic is intended to determine if the number of unique pile sizes is even or odd.
   - Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is true (indicating an even number of unique pile sizes) and 'Bob' otherwise.

3. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for determining the winner based on the number of unique pile sizes. The key insight is that if the number of unique pile sizes is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by making optimal moves. If the number of unique pile sizes is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position under optimal play.
   - The condition `if (set_[0] != 1) : return 'Alice'` ensures that if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice wins immediately, which is correct.
   - The loop that checks the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list and toggles `A` is also correct in determining whether the number of unique pile sizes is even or odd.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like multiple piles of the same size and different sizes correctly.
   - The function correctly identifies the winner based on the number of unique pile sizes.

Given the above analysis, the program is logically correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
