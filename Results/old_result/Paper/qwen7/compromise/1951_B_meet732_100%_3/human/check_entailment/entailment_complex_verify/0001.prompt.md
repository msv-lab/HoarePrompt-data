You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. It identifies the initial position `k` of a cow and finds the indices of the first two cows with ratings greater than the initial cow's rating. Based on the positions of these cows relative to `k`, the function returns one of several possible values: `n-1`, `k-1`, the index of the first identified cow minus 1, the maximum difference between `k` and the index of the first identified cow or the index of the first identified cow minus 1, the minimum difference between the second identified cow's index and 1 or `k` and 1, the maximum difference between the first and second identified cows' indices, or the maximum difference between the first identified cow's index and `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (index of the cow).
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows into a list `l`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list of ratings `a`.
   - It extracts the rating of the cow at index `k` and stores it in `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `ind` to store indices where the rating is greater than `x`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to find indices where the rating is greater than `x` and appends these indices to `ind`.
   - If fewer than 2 such indices are found, it returns `n - 1` (the cow can potentially win all remaining matches).
   - If exactly 1 such index is found, it checks specific conditions and returns the appropriate value.
   - If more than 1 such index is found, it calculates and returns the maximum possible wins based on the positions of these indices.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Maximum Wins:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the scenario where the cow at index `k` can win more than one match by strategically swapping positions.
   - The function does not consider the possibility of swapping the cow at index `k` with another cow to maximize the number of wins.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the cow at index `k` might benefit from being swapped with a cow that has a higher rating but is positioned earlier in the sequence.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's re-evaluate the example test cases with the correct approach:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `6 1`, `[12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]`
- Cow at index 1 has a rating of 12.
- Cow at index 2 has a rating of 10.
- Cow at index 3 has a rating of 14.
- Cow at index 4 has a rating of 11.
- Cow at index 5 has a rating of 8.
- Cow at index 6 has a rating of 3.

- Optimal strategy: Swap cow at index 1 with cow at index 3.
- After swap: `[14, 10, 12, 11, 8, 3]`
- Cow at index 1 (cow with rating 14) wins the first match.
- Cow at index 2 (cow with rating 10) loses the first match.
- Cow at index 1 (cow with rating 14) wins the second match.
- Total wins: 2

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `6 5`, `[7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]`
- Cow at index 5 has a rating of 12.
- Cow at index 1 has a rating of 7.
- Cow at index 2 has a rating of 2.
- Cow at index 3 has a rating of 727.
- Cow at index 4 has a rating of 10.
- Cow at index 6 has a rating of 13.

- Optimal strategy: Swap cow at index 5 with cow at index 3.
- After swap: `[7, 2, 12, 727, 10, 13]`
- Cow at index 1 (cow with rating 7) wins the first match.
- Cow at index 2 (cow with rating 2) loses the first match.
- Cow at index 1 (cow with rating 7) wins the second match.
- Cow at index 2 (cow with rating 12) wins the third match.
- Total wins: 2

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `2 2`, `[1000000000, 1]`
- Cow at index 2 has a rating of 1.
- Cow at index 1 has a rating of 1000000000.

- Optimal strategy: Do nothing.
- Cow at index 2 (cow with rating 1) loses the first match.
- Total wins: 0

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of wins for the cow at index `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
