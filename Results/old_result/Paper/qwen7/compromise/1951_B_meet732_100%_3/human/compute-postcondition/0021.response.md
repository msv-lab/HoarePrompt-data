Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between k minus the index of the first cow with a rating greater than x, or the index of the first cow with a rating greater than x minus 1.**

This means if `k - ind[0]` is greater, the program returns `k - ind[0]`. If `ind[0] - 1` is greater, the program returns `ind[0] - 1`. Here, `ind[0]` is the index of the cow with the smallest rating greater than `x`, and `k` is the index of the initial cow whose rating is being compared.
