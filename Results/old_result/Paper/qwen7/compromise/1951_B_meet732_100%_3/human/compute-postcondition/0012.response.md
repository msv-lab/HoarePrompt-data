Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing indices of the first two cows with ratings greater than the rating of the initial cow at position `k`, `c` is 2, `x` is the integer at index `k` in list `a`, and `a` remains a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The length of `ind` is exactly 1, the first element of `ind` is the index of the cow with the smallest rating among those greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is equal to 0.
