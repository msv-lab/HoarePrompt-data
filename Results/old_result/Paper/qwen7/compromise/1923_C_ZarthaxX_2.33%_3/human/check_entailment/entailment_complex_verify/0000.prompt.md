You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q subarray queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of the array `nums`, `q` is an input integer representing the number of subarray queries, `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where each element represents the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to that index minus the index itself.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of the array `nums`, `q` is an input integer representing the number of subarray queries, `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where each element represents the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to that index minus the index itself, after executing all the iterations of the loop, for each query `(l, r)`, a 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed based on the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, an array `nums` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` subarray queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`. For each query, it checks whether the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds true, where `onesInRange` is the count of 1s in the subarray from index `l` to `r`, and `sumInRange` is the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l` to `r` minus the index values. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program uses a simplified approach to check if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that satisfies the conditions. However, the logic used to determine if the subarray is good is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`:**
   - The variable `onesInRange` counts the number of 1s in the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - The variable `sumInRange` calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r` minus the number of 1s in that subarray.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is good. This condition checks if it's possible to transform the subarray into another array `b` with the required properties, but it doesn't fully account for the constraints.

2. **Missing Consideration of Other Values:**
   - The program assumes that the only values in the subarray are 1s and other values, but it doesn't handle cases where the subarray contains other values that could potentially form a valid `b` array.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of having multiple distinct values in the subarray and how they can be rearranged to satisfy the conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to ensure that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where:
- The sum of the elements in both arrays is equal.
- No element in the subarray is the same as its corresponding element in `b`.
- All elements in `b` are positive.

A more accurate approach would involve checking if the subarray can be split into segments where each segment can be independently transformed into an array of positive integers with different values.

Since the provided program does not correctly handle these cases, it fails to meet the problem requirements for certain inputs, hence the correctness is **False**.
