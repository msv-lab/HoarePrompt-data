Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
- `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer.
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is `k` and `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers that must not be an empty list.

The `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement will join the elements of the `res` list into a single string with spaces between them and then print it.

Since the exact values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `res`. However, we know that `res` is the result of calling `func_1(k, p)`, where `p` is a list of integers.

Output: **' '.join(map(str, func_1(k, p))) (where `func_1(k, p)` returns a list of strings joined by spaces)**
