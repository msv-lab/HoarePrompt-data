Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `qs` will be an empty list, `n` will be the last element that was processed, which is the last element in the original `qs` list, `res` will be a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each `n` in `qs` in the order they appeared, `k` will be the value it was initialized to at the start of the loop, and `p` will be the list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `qs` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The variable `n` will hold the last element of the original `qs` list. The `res` list will contain the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each `n` in `qs`, meaning it will have one entry for each element in `qs`. The variables `k` and `p` will retain their initial values from the first iteration of the loop, as they are not modified within the loop body.
