Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `n` which is being iterated over the elements of `qs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `qs`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` must contain at least one element.
   - `n` is the first element in `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` was the first element in `qs`, after processing `n`, `qs` will now contain the remaining elements (if any).
   - `n` will now be the first element of the updated `qs`.
   - `res` will remain the same since the function `func_1(n, p)` is only called once per iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `qs` must now contain at least one element (since it had at least one before and one was processed).
   - `n` will be the first element of the updated `qs`.
   - `res` remains the same as it was appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`qs` must contain at least one element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**.
