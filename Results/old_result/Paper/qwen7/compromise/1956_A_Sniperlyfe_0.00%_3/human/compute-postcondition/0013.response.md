Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for n in qs`. The variables involved here are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the next element in `qs`.

3. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `qs`, the variable `n` will be updated to the next element in `qs`.
   - The variable `res` is not part of the loop head and its value is determined by the function `func_1(n, p)` which is called within the loop body. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted for the next iteration.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `n` will be set to the next element in `qs`.
   - The variable `res` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the next element in `qs`**
