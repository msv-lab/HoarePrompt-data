Output State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list of results from applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` must be greater than `t-1`**.

This means that the values of `k` and `q` are updated to the integers obtained from the input, while the lists `res` and the condition involving `t` remain unchanged from the initial state.
