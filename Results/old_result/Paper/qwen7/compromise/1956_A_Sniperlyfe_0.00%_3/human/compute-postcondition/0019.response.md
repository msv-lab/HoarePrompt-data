Output State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list of results from applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `t` must be greater than `t-1`**.

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the next input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p`. The values of `k`, `q`, `res`, and the condition for `t` remain unchanged.
