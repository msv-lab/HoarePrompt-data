Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `qs` contains at least one element.
   - `n` is assigned the value of the first element in `qs`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` must contain at least one element.
   - `n` is the first element in `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `qs` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the current iteration, `n` will be set to the next element in `qs` (if `qs` has more than one element).
   - `res` will remain the same since it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `qs` must still contain at least one element.
   - `n` will be the next element in `qs` if `qs` has more than one element; otherwise, the loop will terminate.
   - `res` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`qs` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the second element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**.
