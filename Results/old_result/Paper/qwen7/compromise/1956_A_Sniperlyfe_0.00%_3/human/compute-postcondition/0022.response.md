Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for n in qs:`. The objects involved here are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `n` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `qs` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute, `qs` must contain at least one element. If `qs` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**: Since the loop depends on `qs` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `qs` is not empty.

5. **Consider the initial values**:
   - `k` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
   - `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

Since the loop depends on `qs`, we need to ensure that `qs` is not empty. The other variables (`k`, `q`, `res`, and `p`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `qs` must not be an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is an empty list, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers that must not be an empty list**
