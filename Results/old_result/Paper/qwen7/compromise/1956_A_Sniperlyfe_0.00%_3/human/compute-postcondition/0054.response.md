The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100. `p` is a list of k positive integers representing the sequence a where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100. `qs` is a list of q positive integers representing n_i where 1 <= n_i <= 100. The function checks each element in `qs` to see if it exists in the sequence `p`. For each element in `qs`, if it is found in `p`, the function returns `True`; if it is not found in `p`, the function returns `False`. Since there are multiple return points, the function will return the first match (True or False) it finds for each element in `qs`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters k, q, p (a list of k positive integers), and qs (a list of q positive integers). It checks each element in qs to see if it exists in the sequence p. If any element in qs is found in p, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.**
