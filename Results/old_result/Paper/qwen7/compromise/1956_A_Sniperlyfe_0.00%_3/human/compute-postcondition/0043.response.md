Output State: **`qs` must contain at least one element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**

Explanation: The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the first element in `qs`. The precondition that `qs` must contain at least one element and `n` is the first element in `qs` is still valid. The variable `p` is used in the function call but its value is not specified, so it remains unchanged. The output state includes the updated list `res` which now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
