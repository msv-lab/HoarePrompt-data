Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function aims to simulate the process of kicking out players from the game until no more players can be kicked out in a round. Hereâ€™s what it does:

1. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `n` (the current number of players) is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`.
2. **Sum Calculation**: For each `x` in `p`, if `x` is less than or equal to `n`, it subtracts `x` from `n` using `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))`. This effectively counts how many players can be kicked out in the current round.
3. **Return Statement**: Once the loop exits, it returns the remaining number of players.

#### Function `func_2`
This function processes the input and calls `func_1` for each query:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, followed by the sequence `p` and the list of queries `qs`.
3. **Processing Each Query**: For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
4. **Output**: It prints the results for each query.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The logic correctly simulates the game rules.
2. **Function `func_2`**: It correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

- **Logic**: The function correctly simulates the game by repeatedly removing players based on the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed in a round.
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If `n < min(p)`, the loop won't run, and `n` remains unchanged.
  - If `n == min(p)`, exactly one player is removed.
  - If `n > min(p)`, players are removed according to the sequence `p`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

- **Input Handling**: It correctly reads the input as specified.
- **Query Processing**: It processes each query correctly by calling `func_1` and appending the results.
- **Output**: It prints the results in the required format.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `n = 5`
   - Sequence: `[3, 5]`
   - Output: `2`
     - After first round: Remove 3rd and 5th players -> Remaining: `ABD`
     - After second round: Remove 3rd player -> Remaining: `A`
     - No more players can be removed -> Winners: `A` and `B`

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `n = 5, 3, 6, 7, 9`
   - Sequence: `[3, 5]`
   - Output: `2 1 1 1`
     - `n = 5`: As above, `2` winners.
     - `n = 3`: `A` and `B` -> `2` winners.
     - `n = 6`: `A` and `B` -> `2` winners.
     - `n = 7`: `A` and `B` -> `2` winners.
     - `n = 9`: `A` and `B` -> `2` winners.

### Conclusion

After verifying the logic and edge cases, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and examples provided.

**Correctness: **True**
