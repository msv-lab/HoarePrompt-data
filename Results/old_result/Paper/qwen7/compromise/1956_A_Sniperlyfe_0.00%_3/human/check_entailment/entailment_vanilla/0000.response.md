Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function aims to simulate the process of kicking out players until no more players can be kicked out in a round. Here's what it does:

1. **Initialization**: It takes two parameters, `n` (number of players) and `p` (the sequence of positions to kick out).
2. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `n` (the number of remaining players) is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
3. **Kicking Out Players**: Inside the loop, it calculates the number of players to kick out in the current round using a generator expression `(1 for x in p if x <= n)`. This counts how many players in `p` are within the range `[1, n]`.
4. **Subtraction**: It subtracts the count from `n`.
5. **Return**: Once the loop exits, it returns the final number of players left (`n`).

#### Function `func_2`
This function processes the input and calls `func_1` for each query:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the length of the sequence `p` and the number of queries.
3. **Sequence Reading**: It reads the sequence `p`.
4. **Query Reading**: It reads the sequence of queries `qs`.
5. **Result Calculation**: For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
6. **Output**: It prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the process of kicking out players. It ensures that only players whose positions are less than or equal to the current number of players are considered for kicking out.
   - The subtraction operation correctly reduces the number of players by the count of players to be kicked out in each round.
   - The loop terminates when no more players can be kicked out, which matches the problem's requirement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each query and collects the results.
   - The output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
