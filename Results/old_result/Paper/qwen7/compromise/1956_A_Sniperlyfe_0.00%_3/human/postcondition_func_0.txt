The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing an initial value and a list of positive integers `p`. It repeatedly decreases `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the current value of `n`, as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `p`. After the loop terminates, the function returns 0.
