Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
3. It then reads the values of the cubes `a`.
4. The program calculates the value of the favorite cube using `a[f - 1]`.
5. It sorts the list of cube values in non-increasing order.
6. It iterates over the first `k` elements of the sorted list to count how many times the value of the favorite cube appears.
7. It compares this count with the total occurrences of the favorite cube in the sorted list.
8. Based on the comparison, it prints "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE" accordingly.

The logic in the program matches the problem description accurately. There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code. Therefore, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as described.

Correctness: **True**
