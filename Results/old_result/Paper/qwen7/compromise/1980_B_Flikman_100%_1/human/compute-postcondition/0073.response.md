Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `removed_count` is 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value` otherwise `removed_count` remains unchanged, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts each element to an integer, storing them in the list `a`. The values of `i`, `k`, `removed_count`, `favorite_count`, `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
