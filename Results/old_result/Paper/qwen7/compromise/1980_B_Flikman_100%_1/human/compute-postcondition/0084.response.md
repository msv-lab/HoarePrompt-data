Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 2, and `removed_count` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `removed_count` was initially set to 1 based on the condition that if `sorted_a[3]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 1. However, since the code simply increments `removed_count` by 1 (`removed_count += 1`), `removed_count` is now 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
