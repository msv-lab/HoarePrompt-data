Output State: **`favorite_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`, `i` is `k`, `removed_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`, and all other variables (`k`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, `t`) retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations.**

Explanation: The code `favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)` calculates the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`. This value is stored in the variable `favorite_count`. The values of `i`, `removed_count`, and all other variables (`k`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
