Based on the initial state provided:

- `favorite_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`.
- `removed_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`.
- After 3 iterations, `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
