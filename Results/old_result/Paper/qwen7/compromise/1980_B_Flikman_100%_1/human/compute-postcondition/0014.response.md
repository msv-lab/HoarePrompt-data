Output State: **`removed_count` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a` in descending order, and `i` is incremented by 1 such that the element at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

Explanation: The line `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Since `removed_count` was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
