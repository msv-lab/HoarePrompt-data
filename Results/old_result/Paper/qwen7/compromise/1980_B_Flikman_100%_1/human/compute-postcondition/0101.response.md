Based on the initial state provided:

- `favorite_count` is either 0 or the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`.
- `removed_count` is either 0 or the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`.
- `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.
- `removed_count` is greater than 0.

Given these conditions, we can deduce the following:

- Since `removed_count` is greater than 0, it must be the case that `removed_count` is the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`.
- This implies that `favorite_count` must be 0 because `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.

Therefore, the `print('MAYBE')` statement will simply print the string `'MAYBE'`.

Output: **MAYBE**
