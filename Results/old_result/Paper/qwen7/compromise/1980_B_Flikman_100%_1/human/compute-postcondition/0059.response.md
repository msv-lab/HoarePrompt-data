Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `k` is equal to the original value of `k` (which is greater than 1).
- `removed_count` is 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value` otherwise `removed_count` remains unchanged.
- `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`.
- The current value of `removed_count` is equal to the current value of `favorite_count`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement is directly printing a string, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **YES**
