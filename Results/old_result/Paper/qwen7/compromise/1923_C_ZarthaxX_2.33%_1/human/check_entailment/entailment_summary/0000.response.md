Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by preprocessing the array to calculate the cumulative count of 1s and a modified cumulative sum (each element reduced by its index). This preprocessing allows the program to efficiently check the condition for each query.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and the execution summary:

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - `ones` array stores the cumulative count of 1s up to each position.
   - `sum` array stores the modified cumulative sum up to each position (each element reduced by its index).

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the modified sum (`sumInRange`) within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - It then checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds.
   - If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the query range is a single element (i.e., `l == r`), the program directly prints 'NO', which is correct because a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the conditions of being good.

Given the logic and the edge cases handled correctly, the program appears to be implementing the solution accurately according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
