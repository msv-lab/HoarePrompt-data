You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5.

After all iterations, `q` will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of queries on an array of integers. It first calculates the cumulative count of 1s and the modified cumulative sum (each element reduced by its index) up to each position in the array. For each query, it checks if a certain condition is met within the specified range of the array and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all queries, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that satisfies the conditions, but it does not ensure that the sum of elements in the subarray is even and that each element in the subarray can be replaced with a positive integer different from itself.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the subarray `[1, 2, 1]` from the example input. According to the problem description, for a subarray to be good, it must satisfy the following conditions:
1. The sum of the elements in the subarray must be even.
2. Each element in the subarray must be replaced with a positive integer different from itself.
3. After replacement, the sum of the elements in the subarray must remain the same.

For the subarray `[1, 2, 1]`, the sum is `4`, which is even. However, if we replace `1` with `2` and `2` with `1`, the new subarray would be `[2, 1, 2]`, which still has the same sum `4`. This transformation satisfies all the conditions for the subarray to be good.

However, the provided program incorrectly prints `NO` for this subarray because it does not properly check the conditions. The program calculates the number of `1`s and the sum of the subarray, but it does not verify if the subarray can be transformed into another array with the required properties.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle some valid cases where a subarray should be considered good.
