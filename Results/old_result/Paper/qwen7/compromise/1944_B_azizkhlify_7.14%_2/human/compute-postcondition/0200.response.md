Output State: **`i` is 10, `n` is at least 9, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `re` is 1, and `res` is a list with the element `a[10]` appended and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their initial conditions from the precondition.
