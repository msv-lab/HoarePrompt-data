Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 9.
- `n` is at least 9.
- `a[9]` has been accessed.
- The value of `l[a[9] - 1]` is equal to 1.

We need to determine what `a[i]` is when `i` is 9. Since `a[9]` has been accessed, it implies that `a[9]` exists and has some value, but the exact value is not specified. However, the question does not require us to know the exact value of `a[9]`, only that it is being accessed and printed.

The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[9]`.

Output: **a[9]**
