Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - In each iteration, the postcondition states that `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or unchanged.
   - If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is set to 2.
   - Otherwise, `ul` retains its original value.
   - The condition `ul` is equal to `k * 2` leads to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `i` will be incremented to `i = 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a loop control variable and does not change within the loop body unless explicitly modified.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains a positive integer as it did not change during the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**.
