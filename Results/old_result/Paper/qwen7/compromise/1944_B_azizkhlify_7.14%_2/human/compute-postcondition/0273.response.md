Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Since `i` is initially `n + 1`, the value of `a[i]` is `a[n + 1]`. Therefore, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
