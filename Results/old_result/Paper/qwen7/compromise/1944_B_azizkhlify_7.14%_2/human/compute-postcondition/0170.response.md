Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 7.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged.
   - `ul` retains its original value.

3. **Determine how the loop will change these variables**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 7.
   - After each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (since `i` is being used in a `range(n)` loop).

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 7, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 7.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 7 to 8.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` will either be 2 or remain unchanged. Since `i` changes to 8, we need to check `l[a[8] - 1]`.
   - `ul` retains its original value.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 8, `l[a[8] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged, and `ul` retains its original value**.
