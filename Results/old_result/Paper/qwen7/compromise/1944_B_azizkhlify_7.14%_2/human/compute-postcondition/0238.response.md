Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, and `ul` equals `ur`.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since the initial state specifies that if `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, and given that `i` is `n + 1`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ul` equals `ur`, the only change is that `ur` is updated to be 2 more than its previous value. Therefore, `ul` also becomes 2 more than its previous value.
