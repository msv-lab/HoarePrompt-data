Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
3. **State Adjustment**: We need to determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration and ensure it falls within the loop condition.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = n` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration must be `n + k - 1`, where `k` is the number of iterations completed so far.
   
2. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` should be `n + k`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - The state `r[a[i] - 1]` being incremented by 1 is not directly relevant to the loop head variables.
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

### Conclusion
- The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `n + k`, where `k` is the number of iterations completed so far.

### Final State
Since we don't know the exact number of iterations completed (`k`), we express it as `i` starting from `n` and incrementing by 1 each time.

State: **`i` is `n`** (assuming this is the first iteration of the new loop).

If there were multiple iterations, the state would be adjusted accordingly. However, without additional information about the number of iterations, the most general form is:

State: **`i` is `n`**.

If you need a specific state based on the number of iterations, please provide that information.
