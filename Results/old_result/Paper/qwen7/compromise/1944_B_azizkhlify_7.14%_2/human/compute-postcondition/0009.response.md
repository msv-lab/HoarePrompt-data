Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0 (since it didn't change during the loop body).

5. **Consider the Effect of the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but since `l[a[0] - 1]` was incremented by 1, this information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop variables `i` and `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**.
