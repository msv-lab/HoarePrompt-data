Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes three variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to 0. Since these are the only assignments made, the values of `res`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `re`, `ul`, and `ur`, while keeping the other variables as they were initially.
