Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, `ul` equals `ur`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since `ur` was previously 2 more than its previous value and `ul` equals `ur`, `ul` also gets incremented by 2. All other variables (`i`, `res`, `n`) remain unchanged. The condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid.
