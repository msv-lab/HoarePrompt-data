Output State: **`i` is 7, `ul` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `ul` is incremented by 2, starting from an unspecified initial value (since it's not defined in the initial state). After the operation, `ul` becomes 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 7. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 6 is not affected by the given code snippet.
