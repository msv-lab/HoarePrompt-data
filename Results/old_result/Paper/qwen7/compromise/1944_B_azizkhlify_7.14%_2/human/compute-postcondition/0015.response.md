Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - According to the given state before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2*n - 1`. This means the loop will start when `i` is incremented from `n-1` to `n`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop starts when `i` is incremented from `n-1` to `n`, we need to set `i` to `n` initially.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` being set to `n` and `n` remaining greater than 0.

**State:**
**`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
