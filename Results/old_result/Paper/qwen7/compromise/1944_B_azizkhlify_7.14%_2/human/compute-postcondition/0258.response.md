Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is a list of n zeros, `r` is a list of n zeros**.

The code initializes a new list `r` with `n` zeros. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new list `r` is created with `n` elements, all set to 0.
