Output State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. Since the initial values of `r` and `a` are not specified, we only know that the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` has been incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
