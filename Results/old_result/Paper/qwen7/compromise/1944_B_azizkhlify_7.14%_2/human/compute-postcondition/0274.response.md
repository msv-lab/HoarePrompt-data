Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `r[a[i-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (Note: `a[i-1]` refers to the value at index `i-1` in the array `a`)

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `n` to `2 * n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `n` to `2 * n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r[a[i-1] - 1]` needs to be adjusted based on the new value of `i`.

6. **New Value of `i-1`:**
   - When `i` is `n + 2`, `i-1` will be `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `r[a[n+1] - 1]` will be incremented by 1.

7. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 2`
   - `n` is still a positive integer
   - `r[a[n+1] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**State:**
**`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `r[a[n+1] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
