Output State: **`re` is increased by 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `res`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 after the append operation. The other variables (`re`, `l`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
