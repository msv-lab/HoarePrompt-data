Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, and `ul` equals `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All the initial conditions remain valid after the execution of the `break` statement.
