Output State: **`i` is 9, `n` is at least 9, `a[9]` has been accessed, and the value of `l[a[9] - 1]` is equal to 1, `re` is 1, `res` contains the element `a[9]`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 9, `a[9]` is accessed and its value is added to `res`. All other variables remain unchanged.
