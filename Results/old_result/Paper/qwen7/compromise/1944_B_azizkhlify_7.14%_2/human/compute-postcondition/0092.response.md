Based on the initial state provided, `res` must contain at least one element. However, no specific value or type of `res` is mentioned, nor is the value of `i` defined. Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it could be any valid index that refers to an element in `res`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(i, end=' ')` will print the value of `i` followed by a space. Since `i` could be any valid index (e.g., 0 if `res` has only one element), we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the index of an element in res)**
