Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `l` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
