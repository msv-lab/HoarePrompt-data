Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer; `ul` is 2 more than its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `ul` is incremented by 2. Since the initial value of `ul` is not specified, we can only say that `ul` is now 2 more than its original value. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.
