Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `i` is `2 * n`, each element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` has been incremented by `n`. If `k` is non-zero, the list `res` will contain elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to a maximum of `k` elements. The variable `re` will be equal to the number of elements added to `res`. If `k` is zero, no changes are made to `res` and `re` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is a list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to a maximum of `k` elements if `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is an element of `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is a list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to a maximum of `k` elements if `k` is non-zero, and `i` is the next element in `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is a non-empty list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to a maximum of `k` elements if `k` is non-zero, and `i` is the next element in `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
