Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `re` is incremented by 1, `res` contains `a[n-1]`, `a[n-2]`, and `a[n-1]`, and `l[a[n-1] - 1]` equals 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `i`, `re`, `res`, or `l[a[n-1] - 1]`. It only indicates that the program exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their postcondition values.
