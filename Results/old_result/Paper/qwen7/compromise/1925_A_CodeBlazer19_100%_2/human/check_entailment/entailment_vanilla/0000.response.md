### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The string `s` should have the smallest possible length among all valid solutions.
   - If there are multiple valid strings of the same length, any one of them can be printed.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then prints a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times.

3. **Checking the Solution's Validity:**
   - Consider the example test cases provided:
     - For `n=1` and `k=2`, the output is "ab". This is correct because both 'a' and 'b' are subsequences of "ab".
     - For `n=2` and `k=1`, the output is "aa". This is correct because the only possible string of length 2 using the first 1 alphabet ('a') is "aa", and it is a subsequence of "aa".
     - For `n=2` and `k=2`, the output is "baab". This is correct because all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 alphabets ('a' and 'b') are subsequences of "baab" (e.g., "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb").
     - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the output is "abcbac". This is correct because all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c') are subsequences of "abcbac" (e.g., "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc").

4. **Ensuring Correctness:**
   - The solution generates a string that is at least as long as necessary to contain all subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - The generated string is minimal in length because repeating the first `k` alphabets `n` times ensures that all subsequences of length `n` are covered.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where `n` is 1 or `k` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles cases where `n` and `k` are larger, ensuring that all required subsequences are included.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
