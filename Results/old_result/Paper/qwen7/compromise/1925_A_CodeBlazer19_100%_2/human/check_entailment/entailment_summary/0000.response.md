Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating a string `s` that contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times. This approach ensures that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

Let's analyze the solution step-by-step:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. It then constructs a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets (`'a'` to `'z'`) repeated `n` times.
4. This constructed string will inherently contain all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

This approach works because:
- Repeating the sequence of the first `k` alphabets `n` times ensures that every combination of `n` characters from these `k` alphabets appears as a subsequence.
- Since the string is constructed by repeating the same sequence, it is the shortest possible string that satisfies the condition (as any shorter string would not contain all combinations).

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
