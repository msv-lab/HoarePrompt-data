Output State: **`case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, and `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, with `new_median` being incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`, `i` is `k + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it implies that the `break` statement is breaking out of the context in which it was placed (which could be a loop or conditional structure not shown in the given code snippet). The values of `case`, `op`, `total`, `a`, `b`, `median`, `ma`, `new_median`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that the execution stops at this point.
