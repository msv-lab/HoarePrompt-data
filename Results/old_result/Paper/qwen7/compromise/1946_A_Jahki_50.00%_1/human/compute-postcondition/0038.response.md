Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, and `op` is 1. `b` is sorted.**

Explanation: The line `new_median = b[ma]` does not change the value of `new_median`; it simply reassigns `new_median` to the value of `b[ma]`, which is already defined as the median of the sorted list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
