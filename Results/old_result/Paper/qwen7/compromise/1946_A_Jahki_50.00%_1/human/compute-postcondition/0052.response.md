Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, and `b` is now a sorted version of list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `b = sorted(a)` sorts the list `a` and assigns the sorted list to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
