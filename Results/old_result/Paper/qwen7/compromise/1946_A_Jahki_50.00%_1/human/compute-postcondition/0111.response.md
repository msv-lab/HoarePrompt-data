Output State: **All test cases have been processed.**

In the given loop, the loop continues to run as long as there are more test cases (`num > 0`). After each iteration, `num` is decremented by 1 because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop (`for i in range(0, num)`). The loop processes each `num2` and `case` input, calculates the operations required to increment the median value until it exceeds the original median, and prints the number of operations performed. Once all test cases are processed (i.e., `num` becomes 0), the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, all test cases will have been processed, and the loop will have completed its execution.
