Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `b` is now a sorted version of list `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `ma` which is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. This value is stored in the variable `ma`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
