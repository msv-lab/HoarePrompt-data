Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` must be greater than `median`, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, `op` is increased by 1, and `b` is now a sorted version of the original `b` list.**

Explanation: The line `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`. Since `b` was already sorted before this line, sorting it again does not change its order. Therefore, the values of `b`, `median`, `ma`, and `new_median` remain the same. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `a`, `op`) are not affected by this line of code.
