Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` must be greater than `median`, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, `op` is increased by 1, and `b` is now a sorted version of the original `b` list.**

Explanation: The code `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
