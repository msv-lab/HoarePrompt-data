The code `b = sorted(b)` does not change the value of `b` but instead reassigns `b` to a new sorted list that is already equal to the current value of `b`. Since `b` was previously sorted, sorting it again does not alter its contents. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`op` is incremented by 1, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.**
