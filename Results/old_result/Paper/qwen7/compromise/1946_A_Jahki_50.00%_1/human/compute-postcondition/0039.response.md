Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, `op` is 3, and `b` is a sorted list where each element at index `ma` has been incremented 3 times.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. After the first iteration, `op` is incremented to 1, and `b[ma]` is incremented by 1. This process repeats for a total of 3 iterations, incrementing `b[ma]` by 1 each time. Therefore, after all iterations, `op` will be 3, and `b[ma]` will have been incremented 3 times, making the final value of `b[ma]` equal to the original `median` plus 3.
