Output State: **`op` is incremented by 1, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, and `b[ma]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. All other variables (`total`, `a`, `b`, `median`, `ma`, `new_median`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
