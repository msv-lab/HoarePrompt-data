Output State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is `op + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` and must be less than or equal to `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1 (so `b[ma]` is now `b[ma] + 1`), `b` is a sorted version of list `a`**.

This means that the value of `b[ma]` has been incremented by 1, making it `b[ma] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
