Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `op` is 1
   - `num` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `num2` is an input integer
   - `case` is an input string
   - `total` is 0
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`
   - `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`
   - `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.
   - Since `new_median` is derived from `b` (which is sorted), and `b` is not directly modified within the loop, the only way to change `new_median` is by changing the elements in `b`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to continue, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. This means we need to ensure that the current value of `new_median` is not already greater than `median`.
   - Since `new_median` is determined by the element at index `ma` in the list `b`, we need to ensure that this element is still less than or equal to `median`.

Given the current state, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to ensure that the current `new_median` is still less than or equal to `median`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the element at index `ma` in `b` is still less than or equal to `median`.

**State:**
- `op` is 1
- `num` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `total` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
- `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`
- `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`

State: **`op` is 1, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`**
