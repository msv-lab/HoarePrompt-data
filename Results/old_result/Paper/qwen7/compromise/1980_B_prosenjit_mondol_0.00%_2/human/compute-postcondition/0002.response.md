Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'NO', 'YES', and 'MAYBE' based on the comparison between the k-th largest element and the f-th element in the sorted list a for each test case. For each test case, if the k-th largest element is greater than the f-th element, the output is 'NO'. If the k-th largest element is less than the f-th element, the output is 'YES'. If they are equal, the output is 'YES' unless the k-th element is the second largest element in the list (i.e., k is the last index), in which case the output is 'MAYBE'.
