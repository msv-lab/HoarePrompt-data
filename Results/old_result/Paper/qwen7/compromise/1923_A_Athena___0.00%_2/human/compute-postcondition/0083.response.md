Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed.
   - This means `a` is a list of integers and the first element has already been processed.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while a and a[0] == 0`.
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty and the first element of `a` is `0`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to satisfy both conditions of the loop head:
     1. `a` should not be empty.
     2. The first element of `a` should be `0`.

4. **Current State**:
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, `a` is not empty.
   - For the loop to continue, the first element of `a` must be `0`.

5. **Modifying the State**:
   - We need to ensure that the first element of `a` is `0` for the loop to continue.

### Final Answer

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element set to 0**.

This ensures that the loop condition `a and a[0] == 0` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
