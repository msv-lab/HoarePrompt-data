Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with its first element set to the second element of the original list, and the length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 4, and the last element of `a` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given the initial conditions, the first element of `a` remains unchanged, the last element is now 0 (since the last element was removed), and the length of `a` decreases by 1. Therefore, the new length condition is "less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 4".
