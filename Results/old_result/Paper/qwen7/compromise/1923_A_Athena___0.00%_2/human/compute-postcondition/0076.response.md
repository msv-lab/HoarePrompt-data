Output State: **`a` is a list with its last five elements removed, and the first element of `a` is not zero, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `n`. The initial state of `a` and `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, `a` is a list with its last five elements removed, and the first element of `a` is not zero, and `t` is 1. The value of `n` is set to the integer input provided by the user.
