Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `a` contains no leading zeros and all elements are shifted to the beginning of the list. If the original list had no leading zeros, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will have all its leading zeros removed and the remaining elements will be shifted to the start of the list. If the list originally didn't have any leading zeros, it will remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1. If `a[i]` is not 0, then `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 1, and if `a[1]` is 0, then `res` is 2. If `a[1]` is not 0, then `res` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, and if `a[2]` is 0, then `res` is 1. If `a[2]` is not 0, then the value of `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
