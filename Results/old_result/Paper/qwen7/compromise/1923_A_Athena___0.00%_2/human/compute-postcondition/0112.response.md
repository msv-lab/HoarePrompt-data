Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) where each integer is either 0 or 1, with at least one integer being 1. For each test case, it checks the list of integers and returns a boolean value indicating whether there is at least one 1 in the list.**
