The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, which controls the number of iterations of the loop. Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to adjust the value of `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, the list `a` has had all its leading zeros removed, and the remaining elements are shifted to the beginning of the list. If the list originally did not have any leading zeros, it remains unchanged. This information about the list `a` is not relevant to the loop control variable `t`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is t - 1**
