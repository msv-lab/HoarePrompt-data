Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed.
   
2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the first element of `a` is 0 (`a[0] == 0`).

3. **Objective**:
   - We need to determine what changes are required in the state so that the loop can execute one more time.

4. **Analyzing the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     - `a` should not be empty.
     - The first element of `a` should be 0.

5. **Current State**:
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, it means `a` is not empty.
   - However, the first element of `a` is not necessarily 0, because we only know that the first element was removed from a non-empty list, but we don't know the value of the new first element.

6. **Required Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the first element of `a` must be 0.
   - The length of `a` remains unchanged since it is still a non-empty list.

### Conclusion:

To satisfy the loop condition, the first element of `a` must be 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the first element of `a` is 0.

### Final Answer:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element set to 0**
