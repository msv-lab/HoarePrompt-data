Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The program simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros, which does not account for the actual minimum number of moves needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The expected output is `1`, as moving the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell achieves the goal. However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly counts the remaining zeros after removing leading and trailing zeros.

Another example:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The expected output is `2`, as we can move the chips in the 2nd and 4th cells to the leftmost positions. However, the program will output `3`.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, hence the correctness is **False**.
