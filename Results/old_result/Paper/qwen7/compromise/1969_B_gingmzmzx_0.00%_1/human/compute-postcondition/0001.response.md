Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The state before the loop starts is given as `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The variable `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0**
