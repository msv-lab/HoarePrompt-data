Postcondition: `ans` is either 2 or `zeroes - 1` depending on whether the third character in the list `s` is 0 or not; `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s` plus 1; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `cnt` is `[2, 3]`; and `c` is the third character in the list `s`. After the if-else block executes, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])` if the third character `c` is not 0.
