Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. The provided program does not actually follow the rules of the problem. Instead of performing the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements, the program calculates a sum based on a different formula and prints a fixed number of operations.
3. Specifically, the program calculates a sum using the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), which does not relate to the problem's requirements.
4. The program then prints \( n + n \) as the sum and prints two operations for each row, where each operation sets the entire row or column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \(n\). This does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the matrix elements.
5. The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix elements using the allowed operations.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
