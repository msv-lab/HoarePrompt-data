### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- Nene can perform two types of operations on an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \):
  - Type 1: Permute the elements in a chosen row.
  - Type 2: Permute the elements in a chosen column.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix.
- The solution should use no more than \( 2n \) operations.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
- It initializes `sum` to 1.
- It then iterates from 2 to \( n \) and adds a value to `sum` based on the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\).
- This sum is printed along with \( n + n \).
- For each \( n \), it performs \( n \) operations: one Type 1 and one Type 2 operation, both permuting the entire row or column to the same permutation.

#### Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculated by the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) is not related to the operations described in the problem. This part of the program is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.
2. **Operations**: The program performs \( n \) Type 1 and \( n \) Type 2 operations, which is exactly \( 2n \) operations. However, these operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix elements. Instead, they permute each row and column to the same permutation, which does not necessarily maximize the sum.
3. **Output**: The output format matches the problem statement, but the values being printed are not the maximum possible sums.

Given that the program does not correctly implement the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. The sum calculation and the operations performed are unrelated to the problem's requirements.
