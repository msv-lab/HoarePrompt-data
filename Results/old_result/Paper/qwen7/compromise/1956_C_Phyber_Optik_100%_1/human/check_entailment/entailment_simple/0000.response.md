Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case and calculates a sum using a formula, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
   - The program prints `n + n` as the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is incorrect since the goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements through permutations.
   - The program then prints two operations for each row (one for rows and one for columns) without actually permuting the elements to maximize the sum. This is a significant deviation from the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not maximize the sum of the matrix elements through the allowed operations and instead prints a fixed number of operations and a fixed sum, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
