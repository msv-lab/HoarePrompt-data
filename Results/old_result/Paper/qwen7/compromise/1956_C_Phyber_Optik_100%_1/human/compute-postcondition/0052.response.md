Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and `sum` is 24**.

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable. Initially, `sum` is 6. The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` simplifies to `(4 * 4 - 3 * 3) * 4`, which is `(16 - 9) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28`. Therefore, `sum += 28` results in `sum` becoming `6 + 28 = 34 - 10 = 24`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
