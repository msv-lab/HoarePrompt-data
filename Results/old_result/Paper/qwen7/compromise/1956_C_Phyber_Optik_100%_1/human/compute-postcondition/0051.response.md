Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `sum` is 2 * (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 = 6

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(2, n + 1):`
   - This means `i` starts from 2 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current State of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4.
   - `n` must remain at least 4 to allow the loop to continue.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` becomes 4
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `sum` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and `sum` is 6**
