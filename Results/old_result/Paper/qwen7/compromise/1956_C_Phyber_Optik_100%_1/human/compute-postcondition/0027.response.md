Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is given as 5, but `j` is not part of the loop head, so its value does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `n` is an input integer, and its value is crucial for determining if the loop will execute.
   - `sum` is given as 1, but it is not part of the loop head, so its value does not affect the loop's execution.

3. **Conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 2).
   - The variable `i` will start at 2 and increment until it reaches `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` will start at 2.

Given the initial state where `j` is 5 and `sum` is 1, these values do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 5, `sum` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2**
