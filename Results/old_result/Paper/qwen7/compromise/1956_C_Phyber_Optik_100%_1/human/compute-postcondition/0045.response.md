Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, and the final value of `sum` is 120. The values of `j`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their last known state.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `sum` will have a value of 120. The other variables `j`, `i`, and `n` will retain their values from the last iteration, which were `j` is 5, `i` is 5, and `n` is the same as before.
