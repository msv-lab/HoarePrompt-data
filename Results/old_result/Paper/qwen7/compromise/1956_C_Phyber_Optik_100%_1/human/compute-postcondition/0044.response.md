Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is defined as `j_prev + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `j = j_prev + 2`, let's denote `j_prev` as some integer value, say `k`. Therefore, `j = k + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `j`, so `n > k + 2`. Let's assume `n = k + 3` for simplicity, although the exact value of `n` isn't specified, it must satisfy `n > k + 2`.

4. **Calculate Each Part of the Print Statement:**
   - `2`: This is a constant value.
   - `n - j + 1`: Substituting the values, this becomes `(k + 3) - (k + 2) + 1 = 2`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This expands to the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `n = k + 3`, then `range(1, n + 1)` becomes `range(1, k + 4)`, which is `[1, 2, 3, ..., k + 3]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `2`, `2`, followed by the numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive).

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **2 2 1 2 3 ... (n-1) n (where n is an integer greater than j_prev + 2 and j = j_prev + 2)**
