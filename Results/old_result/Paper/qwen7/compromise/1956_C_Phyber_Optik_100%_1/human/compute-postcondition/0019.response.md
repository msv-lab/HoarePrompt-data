Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 1).

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` was 2, after incrementing it by 1, `j` will be 3.

5. **Determine the condition for `n`**:
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4**
