Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 but no specific value is provided for `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Print Statement**:
   - The first argument is `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given `j = 3`, this becomes `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
   - The third argument uses the `*range(1, n + 1)` which expands to a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output `2`, followed by `n - 2`, followed by the range of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given that `n` must be greater than 3, let's assume a specific value for `n` to illustrate the output. For instance, if `n = 5` (which satisfies the condition `n > 3`):

- `2` (first argument)
- `5 - 2 = 3` (second argument)
- `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` (third argument, expanded from `range(1, 6)`)

Therefore, the output would be: `2 3 1 2 3 4 5`.

However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, the general form of the output is:

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, ..., n - 1, n** (where `n` is any integer greater than 3).
