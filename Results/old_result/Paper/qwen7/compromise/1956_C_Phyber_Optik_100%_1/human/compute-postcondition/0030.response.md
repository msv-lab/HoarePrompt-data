Output State: **`j` is 5, `sum` is 32, `i` is 3, `n` is the same as before**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum` by adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. Given `i` is 3, the expression evaluates to `(3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 = (9 - 4) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`. Therefore, `sum` changes from 20 to 20 + 15 = 32. The values of `j`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
