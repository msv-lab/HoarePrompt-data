Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `n + 1`. Given that `j` is now 2, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than or equal to 3 (but since `n` is given to be at least 4, this condition is already satisfied).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4**
