Based on the initial state provided:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4
- `sum` is 30
- `i` is 5

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(sum, n + n)
```

Let's break it down:
- `sum` is explicitly given as 30.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we will keep it as `n`.
- The expression `n + n` simplifies to `2 * n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `sum` and `2 * n`.

Output: **30, 2 * n**
