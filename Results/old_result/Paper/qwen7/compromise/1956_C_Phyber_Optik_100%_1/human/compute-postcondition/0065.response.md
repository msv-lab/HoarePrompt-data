Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Calculate the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` will be 3.

5. **Determine the new condition for `n`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` (which will be 3) must still be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the state**: Based on the above conditions, we need to update the state to reflect the next iteration.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
