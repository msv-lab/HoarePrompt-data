Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - We don't have specific values for `j` or `n` given, but we know that the loop has just completed an iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1 from its value in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be equal to the value it had at the start of the previous iteration plus 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given that the loop just finished an iteration, let's denote the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration as `j_prev` and the value of `n` remains unchanged. After the previous iteration, `j` would be `j_prev + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `j_prev + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `j_prev < n`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_prev + 1`, and `n` remains the same.

**Final State**:
- `j` is now `j_prev + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Since we don't have specific values for `j_prev` and `n`, we can express the state as follows:

State: **`j` is `j_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 1`**
