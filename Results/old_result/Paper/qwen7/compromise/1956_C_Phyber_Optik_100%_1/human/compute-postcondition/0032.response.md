Output State: **`j` is 5, `sum` is 48, `i` is 4, `n` is the same as before**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum` by adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. Given that `i` is 4, the expression evaluates to `(4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4 = (16 - 9) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28`. So, `sum` becomes `32 + 28 = 48`. The values of `j`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
