Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4, and `sum` is the sum calculated by the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for all `i` from 2 to `n`.**

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `j` will be incremented to `n + 1` since the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive. The condition `n` must be greater than 4 remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and not modified within the loop. The variable `sum` is updated in each iteration according to the provided formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for `i` ranging from `2` to `n`. This means `sum` accumulates the results of applying the formula for each `i` from `2` to `n`.
