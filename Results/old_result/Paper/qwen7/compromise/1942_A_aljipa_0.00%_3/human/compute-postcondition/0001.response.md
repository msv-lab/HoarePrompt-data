State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, _ is not a variable that needs adjustment as it is a placeholder**.

Explanation:
- The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used outside the loop.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will execute. Since `t` is given to be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), we need to ensure that `t` meets this condition for the loop to execute properly.
