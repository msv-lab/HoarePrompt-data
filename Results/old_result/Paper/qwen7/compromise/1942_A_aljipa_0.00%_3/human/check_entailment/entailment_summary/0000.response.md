Reasoning:
1. **Case Analysis Based on \( k \)**:
   - When \( k = n \): The requirement is that all cyclic shifts of the array should be sorted. This means that the array itself must be sorted. The program correctly handles this case by printing a list of \( n \) ones, which is a sorted array.
   - When \( k = 1 \): Only one cyclic shift should be sorted. The program correctly handles this case by generating a list with numbers ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \). This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
   - When \( k \neq n \) and \( k \neq 1 \): The requirement cannot be satisfied because having exactly one sorted cyclic shift when \( k \neq 1 \) and more than one sorted cyclic shift when \( k \neq n \) is impossible for an arbitrary array. The program correctly handles this case by printing -1.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( k = n \) by ensuring the array is fully sorted.
   - It also correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) by ensuring only the original array is sorted.
   - For all other cases, it correctly returns -1, indicating no valid array exists.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
