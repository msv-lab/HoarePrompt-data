### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then generates a result list `res` based on the values of `k` and `n`:
     - If `k == n`, it sets `res` to `[1] * n`. This means every cyclic shift would be sorted.
     - If `k == 1`, it sets `res` to `range(n)`. This means only one specific cyclic shift will be sorted.
     - Otherwise, it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating no valid array can be found.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - For `k == n`: The array `[1] * n` ensures that every cyclic shift is sorted because all elements are the same.
   - For `k == 1`: The array `range(n)` ensures that only one specific cyclic shift is sorted. For example, for `n = 3`, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has only one sorted cyclic shift `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - However, the logic for `k == 1` is flawed. The array `range(n)` does not ensure that only one cyclic shift is sorted. Instead, it ensures that the first cyclic shift is sorted, but subsequent cyclic shifts will also be sorted due to the increasing order of elements. For instance, for `n = 3`, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has three sorted cyclic shifts: `[0, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 0]`, and `[2, 0, 1]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the case when `k == 1`. The array `range(n)` does not meet the requirement of having exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
   - Other values of `k` are correctly handled by setting `res` to `[-1]`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for `k == 1` is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
