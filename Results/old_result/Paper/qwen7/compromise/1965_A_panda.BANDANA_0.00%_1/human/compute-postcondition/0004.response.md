Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t and for each t, a positive integer n and a list of n integers. It checks if the number 1 is present in the list for each test case. If 1 is found in any list, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice' for that test case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
