Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `1`, `math.ceil(k / 2)`, or `k // 2 + 1`. The specific value on each line depends on the values of `n` and `k` provided for each test case within the range specified. For each test case, if `k` equals 1, the output will be `1`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the output will be `math.ceil(k / 2)`. Otherwise, the output will be `k // 2 + 1`.
