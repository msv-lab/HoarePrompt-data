Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers: t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive; n is an integer between 2 and 10^8, inclusive; and k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, inclusive. The function returns a result based on the relationship between these three integers.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases (indicated by t), where for each test case, it takes two integers n and k and returns a result based on their values, ensuring n and k meet the specified constraints.
