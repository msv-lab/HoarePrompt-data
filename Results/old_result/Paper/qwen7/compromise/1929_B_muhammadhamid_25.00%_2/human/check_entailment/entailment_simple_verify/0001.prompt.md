You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `1`, `math.ceil(k / 2)`, or `k // 2 + 1`. The specific value on each line depends on the values of `n` and `k` provided for each test case within the range specified. For each test case, if `k` equals 1, the output will be `1`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the output will be `math.ceil(k / 2)`. Otherwise, the output will be `k // 2 + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of cells to color such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - For a grid of size \( n \times n \), there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), we need to color at least one cell, so the answer is 1.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can use a simple formula to calculate the minimum number of cells needed. Each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
     - For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \), we need to color 2 cells to cover 4 diagonals.
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to ensure that the remaining cells (beyond the initial \( 2n \)) are also covered. This means we need to add an additional cell for every extra diagonal beyond \( 2n \).

3. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula used in the code:
     - If \( k \leq 2n \), the number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
     - If \( k > 2n \), the number of cells needed is \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

4. **Code Implementation**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case when \( k = 1 \).
   - It uses the correct formula for \( k \leq 2n \) and \( k > 2n \).

5. **Examples**:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
     - \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 6 \)
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \):
     - \( \frac{9}{2} + 1 = 5 \)
   - For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \):
     - \( \frac{7}{2} + 1 = 4 \)
   - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \):
     - \( \frac{11}{2} + 1 = 6 \)
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)

Given the analysis and examples, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cells to color.
