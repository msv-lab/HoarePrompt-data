Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). The function `func_1` accurately computes the number of cats that need to be added and removed to achieve the desired configuration. The maximum of these two values gives the minimum number of operations needed, as each operation (adding or removing a cat) counts as one day. The program handles multiple test cases as specified and outputs the correct result for each case.
