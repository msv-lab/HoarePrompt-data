Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that there are at least `m` problems for each difficulty level. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the count of required problems (`ans`) without considering the total number of rounds (`m`). 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

- For the first test case, the program outputs `2`, but the correct answer should be `0` because there are already enough problems for difficulty levels 'A' and 'F'.
- For the second test case, the program outputs `5`, but the correct answer should be `2` because there are already enough problems for difficulty levels 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', and only one more problem of difficulty 'A' or 'F' is needed.
- For the third test case, the program outputs `1`, which is correct.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates `ans`. It should ensure that for each difficulty level, the number of problems available is at least `m`. The current implementation does not account for this properly. A corrected approach would involve checking the minimum count for each difficulty level and calculating the shortfall for each level, summing these shortfalls to get the total number of additional problems needed.
