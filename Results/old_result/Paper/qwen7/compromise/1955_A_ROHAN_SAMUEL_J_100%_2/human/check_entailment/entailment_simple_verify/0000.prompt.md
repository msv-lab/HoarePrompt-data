You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing the result of the loop's computation for each test case. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it checks whether `2 * a < b`. If true, it prints `a * n`; otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even, it directly prints `a * n` if `2 * a < b`, otherwise it prints `n // 2 * b`. The number of lines in the output state equals the number of test cases provided as input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where buying yogurts in pairs using the promotion price is more advantageous, especially when `n` is odd. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where the cost of buying `n-1` yogurts in pairs and one yogurt at the regular price is less than the cost of buying all `n` yogurts individually or in pairs.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 5 11
```
Here, `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`. The correct minimum cost should be `15` (buying two yogurts for `11` burles and one yogurt for `5` burles). However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `16` (since `n % 2 == 1` and `2 * a > b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a` which is `16`).

To fix this, the program should consider the cost of buying `n-1` yogurts in pairs and one yogurt at the regular price when `n` is odd. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                # Consider the cost of buying n-1 yogurts in pairs and one yogurt at the regular price
                print((n - 1) // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)

func()
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all cases, including when buying in pairs is more advantageous.
