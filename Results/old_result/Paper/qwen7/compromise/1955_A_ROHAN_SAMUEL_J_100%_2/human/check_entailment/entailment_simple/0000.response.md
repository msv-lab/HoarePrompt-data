Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is as follows:
   - If `n` is odd, it checks if `2 * a < b`:
     - If true, it calculates the cost as `a * n` because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
     - If false, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` because buying pairs of yogurts is cheaper.
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks if `2 * a < b`:
     - If true, it calculates the cost as `a * n` because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
     - If false, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` because buying pairs of yogurts is cheaper.
4. The logic handles all edge cases correctly, including when `n` is odd and when `n` is even.
5. The program outputs the correct results for each test case as per the examples provided.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
