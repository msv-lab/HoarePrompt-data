Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `itm` which iterates over the list `mex`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `itm`**: Since `itm` is an iterator over the list `mex`, at the start of the loop, `itm` should be set to the first element of `mex`.

3. **Check the initial state of `mex`**: The list `mex` is defined as containing values from `minn` up to the maximum value in `arr` and differences calculated based on conditions. However, the exact initial state of `mex` is not specified, but we know it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Other variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `maxx` remain unchanged according to the given information.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `itm` should be set to the first element of `mex`.
- `mex` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be modified as follows:

State: **`itm` is the first element of `mex`, `mex` must contain at least one element, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, `maxx` is the maximum difference found between elements in `arr` and `minn`**.
