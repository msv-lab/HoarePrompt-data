Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input for `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and is not affected by the code. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input, which is within the specified range.
