You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: Output State: `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `mex` is a list containing values from `minn` up to the maximum value in `arr` and differences calculated based on conditions, `maxx` is the maximum difference found between elements in `arr` and `minn`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `itm` takes on each value in `mex` in order, starting from `minn` up to the maximum value in `arr`, with `minn`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mex` remaining unchanged, and `maxx` remaining unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and an array `a` of `n` integers where -`n` ≤ a_i ≤ `n`. The function does not return a value but processes each test case according to the given constraints and array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
