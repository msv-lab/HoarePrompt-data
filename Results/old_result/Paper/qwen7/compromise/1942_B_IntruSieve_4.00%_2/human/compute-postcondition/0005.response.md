Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting value for `range(n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Initially, `i` is 0, so the loop will execute as long as `0 < n`, which is always true given the constraints on `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0 and `n` is already constrained to be within the specified range, no adjustments are needed for `i` or `n`.
   - The other variables (`minn`, `t`, `arr`, `mex`, and `maxx`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the initial values of `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5**
