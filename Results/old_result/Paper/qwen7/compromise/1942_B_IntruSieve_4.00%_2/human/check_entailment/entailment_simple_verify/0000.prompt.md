You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the MEX value needs to be determined correctly for each position in the array.

Let's analyze the given example:

### Example Analysis
Given:
- Test case count: 3
- First test case: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)

The expected output is:
\[ p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \]

However, the program generates:
\[ p = [0, 1, 0, 1, 2] \]

Let's break down the issue:
1. **First Element**: \( p[0] = 0 \)
   - \( a[0] = 1 \)
   - MEX(\([0]\)) = 1
   - \( a[0] = \text{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \) (Correct)

2. **Second Element**: \( p[1] = 1 \)
   - \( a[1] = 1 \)
   - MEX(\([0, 1]\)) = 2
   - \( a[1] = \text{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \) (Correct)

3. **Third Element**: \( p[2] = 0 \)
   - \( a[2] = -2 \)
   - MEX(\([0, 1, 0]\)) = 2
   - \( a[2] = \text{MEX}([0, 1, 0]) - 0 = -2 \) (Incorrect, should be 2)

4. **Fourth Element**: \( p[3] = 1 \)
   - \( a[3] = 1 \)
   - MEX(\([0, 1, 0, 1]\)) = 2
   - \( a[3] = \text{MEX}([0, 1, 0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \) (Correct)

5. **Fifth Element**: \( p[4] = 2 \)
   - \( a[4] = 2 \)
   - MEX(\([0, 1, 0, 1, 2]\)) = 3
   - \( a[4] = \text{MEX}([0, 1, 0, 1, 2]) - 2 = 2 \) (Correct)

The issue lies in the third element, where the program incorrectly sets \( p[2] = 0 \) instead of \( p[2] = 2 \). This is because the program does not correctly update the MEX value when it encounters a negative value in \( a \).

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the MEX calculation and ensure that the values in \( p \) are unique and satisfy the condition \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the output does not meet the problem description for the given example.
