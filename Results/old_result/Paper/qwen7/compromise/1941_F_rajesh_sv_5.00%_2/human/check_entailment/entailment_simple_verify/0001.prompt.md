You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1` and `wrapper` are defined but are not used in the main logic. These functions seem to be placeholders or might be part of a larger context not shown here.
   - `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7` are helper functions that read input from stdin. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Main Function Logic (`func_7`)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of prepared problems (`n`), models (`m`), and functions (`k`).
   - It reads the complexities of the prepared problems (`A`), the models (`D`), and the functions (`F`).
   - It initializes variables to track the maximum difference (`max_diff`), the next maximum difference (`next_max_diff`), and the index of the current maximum difference (`index`).
   - It iterates through the prepared problems to find the maximum and next maximum differences.
   - It then uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find the optimal new problem complexity by combining a model and a function.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum achievable imbalance.

### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The input reading functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) correctly read the required data types and formats as specified in the problem.

2. **Finding Maximum and Next Maximum Differences**:
   - The logic to find `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` is correct. It correctly identifies the largest gap between consecutive prepared problems.

3. **Combining Models and Functions**:
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find the optimal new problem complexity is correct. It ensures that the new problem complexity is chosen such that the imbalance is minimized.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where no improvement is possible by ensuring that the final answer is the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum achievable imbalance by adding at most one problem. All necessary steps and checks are present, and the code adheres to the problem constraints and requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
