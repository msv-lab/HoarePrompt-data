Output State: The loop continues to execute until `l` is no longer less than `h`. At this point, either `l` will be equal to `h` or the condition inside the while loop will no longer be satisfied. Given the nature of the binary search-like algorithm, `l` and `h` will converge to the same value, indicating that the optimal `mid` has been found.

The final values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be `D[l] + f` and `D[l + 1] + f`, respectively, since `l` and `h` will be equal. The variable `ans` will hold the minimum value it was updated to during the loop execution, which means it will contain the best solution found for the given conditions.

In summary, the output state after all iterations of the loop will have `ans` as the minimum value found, `mid_sum` as `D[l] + f`, `mid_next_sum` as `D[l + 1] + f`, and `l` (which is equal to `h`) will be the midpoint where the optimal solution was determined.
