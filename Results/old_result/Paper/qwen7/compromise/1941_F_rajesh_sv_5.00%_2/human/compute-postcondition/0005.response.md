The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. For the loop to execute again, `testcases` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 1.

To proceed to the next iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 2 because the loop runs from 0 to `testcases - 1`.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 2**
