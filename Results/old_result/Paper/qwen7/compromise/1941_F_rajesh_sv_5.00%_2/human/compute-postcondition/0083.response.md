Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` is strictly less than `h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and `h`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, and only the value of `mid` is updated.
