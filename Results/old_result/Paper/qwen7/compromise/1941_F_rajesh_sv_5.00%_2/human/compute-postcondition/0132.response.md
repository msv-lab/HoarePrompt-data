Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value among all updates made during the loop execution, `mid_sum` is `D[l] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + 1] + f`, and `l` (which is equal to `h`) is the final index where the optimal solution was determined.**

In this final output state, `ans` will hold the smallest value obtained from the expression `min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))` over all iterations of the loop. The variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` represent the sums `D[l] + f` and `D[l + 1] + f` respectively, reflecting the values used in the comparison during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `l` will be equal to `h` and will indicate the index in the list `D` that contributes to the final minimum value of `ans`.
