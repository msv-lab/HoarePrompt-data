Output State: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is the final value determined by the loop, which is either `l` or `h` when `l` is no longer less than `h`, `h` is the index just after the last valid `mid` calculated, and `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`.

After all iterations of the loop, the loop condition `l < h` will no longer be true, meaning `l` will be equal to or greater than `h`. The variable `mid` will hold the last valid midpoint value that satisfies the loop's condition. The `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be the sums of the elements at `mid` and `mid + 1` respectively, both incremented by `f`.
