Postcondition: `ans` remains the minimum value it has been updated to throughout the entire loop execution, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, `l` is updated to the value returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, `h` is assigned the value `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, and `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.
