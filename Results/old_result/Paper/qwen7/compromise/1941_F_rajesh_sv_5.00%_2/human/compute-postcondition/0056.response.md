Postcondition: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated based on the condition: if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` is updated to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `mid` remains as `l + (h - l) // 2` and `h` is updated to `mid`. `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`.
