Output State: `testcases` must be greater than or equal to 3 and `func_6()` has been called 3 times.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `testcases` should have a value of at least 3 (since it needs to be greater than 2 for the loop to run 3 times), and `func_6()` would have been called exactly 3 times during these iterations.
