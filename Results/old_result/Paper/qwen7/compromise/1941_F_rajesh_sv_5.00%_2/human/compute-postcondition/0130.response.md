Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f), `mid_sum` is `D[l] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + 1] + f`, and `l` (which is equal to `h`) is the midpoint where the optimal solution was determined.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of two expressions: `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, and `l` (which is equal to `h`) remains the midpoint where the optimal solution was determined.
