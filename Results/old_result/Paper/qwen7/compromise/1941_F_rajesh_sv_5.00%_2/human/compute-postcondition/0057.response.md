Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while l < h`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `l` and `h`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
   - `mid` is updated based on the condition: if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` is updated to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `mid` remains as `l + (h - l) // 2` and `h` is updated to `mid`.
   - `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must remain less than `h`.
   - Since `l` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, we need to ensure that `l` and `h` maintain the relationship `l < h`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `l` and `h` satisfy the condition `l < h` for the next iteration.

Given the current state, the only variables that need adjustment are `l` and `h`. Since `l` must be less than `h`, no specific value change is required for `l` and `h` as long as they maintain this relationship.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can proceed to the next iteration.

**State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated based on the condition: if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` is updated to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `mid` remains as `l + (h - l) // 2` and `h` is updated to `mid`, and `l` and `h` must satisfy `l < h`.**
