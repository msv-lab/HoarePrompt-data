Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or remains unchanged, `index` is the index where `max_diff` is found or remains None, `i` is 2, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, and `index` is set to 2. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`.
