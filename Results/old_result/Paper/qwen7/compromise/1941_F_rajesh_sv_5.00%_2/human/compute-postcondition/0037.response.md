Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found across all elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found or remains unchanged, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains `None`, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` is `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = max_diff` simply assigns the value of `max_diff` to `ans`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain the same as the initial state.
