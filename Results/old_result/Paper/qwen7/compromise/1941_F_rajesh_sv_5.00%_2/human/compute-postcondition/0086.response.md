Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` is equal to `mid`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables (`ans`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and `mid`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
