Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `h` is greater than `l`.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
