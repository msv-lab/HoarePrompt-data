Output State: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is the final index calculated based on the condition inside the loop, `h` is the final value determined by the loop's termination condition, and `l` is the final index which is the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `mid` will be the last index calculated within the loop based on the given condition. `h` will be set to `mid` if `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`, or it will be `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` if the loop terminates due to `l >= h`. Similarly, `l` will be the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`, and it will remain unchanged throughout the loop iterations unless the loop condition `l < h` is no longer satisfied. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be updated to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively, reflecting the last valid indices used in the loop.
