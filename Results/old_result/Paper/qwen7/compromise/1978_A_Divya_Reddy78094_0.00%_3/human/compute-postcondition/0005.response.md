Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer t indicating the number of books and another integer n indicating the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it sorts the list of page counts in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest page counts. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value.**
