Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n` down to 1 (exclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n-2`.

### Adjusting the State
- `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to become `n-2`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

### Updated State
- `i` is now `n-2`
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
