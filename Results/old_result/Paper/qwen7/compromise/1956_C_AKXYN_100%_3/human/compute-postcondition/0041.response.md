Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `'1 %d' % i`: This part formats the string to include the value of `i` after the number 1. Since `i` is `n-1`, this will be `'1 (n-1)'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n+1` into separate arguments for the print function. For example, if `n` is 4, `range(1, 5)` would generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

4. **Combining the Parts**:
   - The formatted string `'1 %d' % i` will be `'1 (n-1)'`.
   - The unpacked range will be the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

5. **Final Output**:
   - When combined, the print statement will output a single line with the string `'1 (n-1)'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Given that `n` must be at least 4, let's assume `n = 4` for a concrete example:
- `i` would be `4-1 = 3`.
- The print statement would then output: `'1 3 1 2 3 4'`.

However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, the general form of the output is:
- `'1 (n-1)'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Output: **'1 (n-1) 1 2 ... (n-1) (n)'**
