Output State: **`i` is now `i + 1`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `(i + 1) * (2 * (i + 1) + 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1`. The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 3)` is evaluated and added to `res`. Since the initial value of `i` was `i + 1`, the new value of `i` is now `i + 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `res` is updated to its original value plus the computed expression.
