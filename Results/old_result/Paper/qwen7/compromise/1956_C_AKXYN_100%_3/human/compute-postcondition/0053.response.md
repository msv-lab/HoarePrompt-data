Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` is increased by `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than its value in the current iteration.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n`, so `n` must remain the same.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The value of `res` is determined by the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, but since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to explicitly state the updated value of `res` unless it changes based on the new `i` and `n`.
   - We only need to update `i` to `i + 1` and ensure `n` remains unchanged.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is increased by ((i + 1) + 1) * (2 * (i + 1) + 1), `i` is i + 1, `n` must be the same**.

However, to simplify and focus on the variables in the loop head, we can state:

State: **`i` is i + 1, `n` must be the same**.

Since the exact value of `res` is not needed for the next iteration, we can just focus on updating `i` and ensuring `n` remains unchanged.

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is i + 1, `n` must be the same**.
