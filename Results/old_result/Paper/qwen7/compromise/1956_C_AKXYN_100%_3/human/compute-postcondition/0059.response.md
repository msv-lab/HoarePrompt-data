Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` is 2.
   - `mat` is `[[1], [2]]`.
   - `res` is 30.

2. **Code Execution:**
   The code snippet to be executed is:
   ```python
   print(res, n << 1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `res` is explicitly given as 30.
   - `n` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The bitwise left shift operator `<<` shifts the bits of `n` to the left by 1 position. In binary, `2` is `10`. Shifting it left by 1 position gives `100`, which is `4` in decimal.

4. **Output:**
   - `res` is 30.
   - `n << 1` is 4.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **30 4**
