Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` + 1, `res` is `res` + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1 + 1`. The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid, but since `i` has been incremented, `n` must now be greater than `i + 1 + 1`. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified, so we only mention the updated value of `i` and the change in `res`.
