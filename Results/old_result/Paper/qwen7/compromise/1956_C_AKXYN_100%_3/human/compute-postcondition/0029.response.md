State: **`res` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0.
2. The loop runs for `n` iterations, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because the `range(n)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is not greater than 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
4. The other variables (`res`, `t`, and `mat`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are that `n` must be greater than 0.
