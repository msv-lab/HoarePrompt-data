Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `res` is 1
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to n
   - `i` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `res` remains 1 because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `res`.
   - `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` is updated to 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`res` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to n, `i` is 1**.
