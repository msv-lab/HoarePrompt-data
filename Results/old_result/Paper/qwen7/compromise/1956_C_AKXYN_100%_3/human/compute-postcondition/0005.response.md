Output State: **`res` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to n, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Initially, `i` is 0, so `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` equals `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`. Thus, `res` is updated to `0 + 1 = 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.
