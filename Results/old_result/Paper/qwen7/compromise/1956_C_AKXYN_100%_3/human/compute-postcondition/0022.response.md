Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is 204.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). The value of `t` is not explicitly given, but it does not affect the print statement.
   - `n` is 3.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Breaking Down the Print Statement:**
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement uses string formatting. Since `i` is 1, this will become `'2 %1'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range function, which generates numbers from 1 to `n + 1 - 1`, so it will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.

4. **Combining the Parts:**
   - The formatted string `'2 %1'` will be combined with the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - The `%1` in the string will be replaced by the value of `i`, which is 1.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'2 1'` followed by the sequence `1 2 3`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output will be the string `'2 1'` followed by the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 1 1 2 3**
