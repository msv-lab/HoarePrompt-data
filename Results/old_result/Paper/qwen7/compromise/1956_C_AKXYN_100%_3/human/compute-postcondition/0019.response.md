Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is 204.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). The value of `t` is not explicitly given, but it does not affect the print statement.
   - `n` must be 3.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be executed is `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Explanation of the Print Statement:**
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the statement uses string formatting. Here, `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and `i` is the integer value 2. So, `'2 %d' % i` becomes `'2 2'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Since `n` is 3, `range(1, 4)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into separate arguments for the `print` function.

4. **Combining the Parts:**
   - The `print` function combines the string `'2 2'` with the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` and prints them together.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 2 1 2 3**
