Given the initial state where `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, let's break down the code snippet:

```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

1. **Understanding `i` and `n`:**
   - `i` is explicitly stated to be `n`.
   - `n` is a variable that must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **First part of the print statement:**
   - `'1 %d' % i` formats the string such that `%d` is replaced with the value of `i`.
   - Since `i` is `n`, this part becomes `'1 %d' % n`.

3. **Second part of the print statement:**
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object into separate arguments for the print function.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output:

- The string `'1 %d' % n` which is `'1 n'` when `n` is substituted.
- Followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Since `n` must be at least 3, let's consider `n = 3` for clarity (though it could be any value greater than or equal to 3):

- For `n = 3`, the output would be: `'1 3' 1 2 3`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'1 n' 1 2 ... n (where n is the value of n, and the numbers are from 1 to n inclusive)**
