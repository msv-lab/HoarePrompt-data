Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is 204
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` must be 3
- `i` is 3

We need to evaluate the `print` statement:

```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `'1 %d' % i`: Here, `i` is 3. So, this part of the string will be formatted as `'1 3'`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: Since `n` is 3, `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`. The `*` operator unpacks this list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

Combining these parts, the `print` statement will output the string `'1 3'` followed by the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 3 1 2 3**
