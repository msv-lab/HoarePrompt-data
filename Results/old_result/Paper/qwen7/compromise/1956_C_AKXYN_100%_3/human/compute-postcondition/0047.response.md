Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `int(input())` and `_` (the loop variable). However, since `_` is typically an underscore and does not hold a meaningful value for the loop logic, we focus on `int(input())`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be 2 (because if it were 1, the loop would have already completed).

5. **New State**: Given that `int(input())` must be 2 for the loop to execute one more time, and considering the initial condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, we need to ensure that `n` remains consistent with its requirement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `int(input())` must be 2**
