Output State: `i` is 0; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 30.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. Given `n` is 2, the loop will run twice. Let's calculate the value of `res` step-by-step based on the provided loop code and the operations described:

1. **First iteration (i = 2):**
   - Print statements are executed, but they do not affect the value of `res`.
   - No changes are made to `res`, `n`, `mat`, or `i`.

2. **Second iteration (i = 1):**
   - Print statements are executed, but they do not affect the value of `res`.
   - No changes are made to `res`, `n`, `mat`, or `i`.

Since the loop runs twice, `i` will be decremented to 0 after the loop completes. The other variables (`n`, `mat`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial or intermediate states because they are not modified within the loop. Thus, the final state is `i` is 0; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 30.
