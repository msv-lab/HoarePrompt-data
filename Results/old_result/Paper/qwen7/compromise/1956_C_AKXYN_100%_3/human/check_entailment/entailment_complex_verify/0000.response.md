### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - A square matrix `mat` of size `n x n` is initialized with values ranging from 1 to `n` in a sequential manner. This means that `mat[i][j] = j + 1` for all `i` and `j`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The variable `res` is calculated using the formula `res = sum((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i in range(n))`. This formula is not directly related to the problem's requirements but seems to be a placeholder or a mistake.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints `res` and `2 * n` as the maximum sum and the number of operations, respectively.
   - It then prints a sequence of operations for each value of `n` from `n` down to 1. Each operation is of the form:
     - `1 i` followed by a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
     - `2 i` followed by a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Operations:**
   - The operations printed do not reflect the actual logic needed to maximize the sum of the matrix. Instead, they seem to be a fixed sequence of operations that do not change the matrix content.

Given the problem description, the goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix using no more than 2n operations. The provided program does not achieve this. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Incorrect Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum `res` is calculated using a formula that does not relate to the problem's requirements. The correct approach would involve setting the matrix to maximize the sum, which is not done here.

- **Excessive Operations:**
  - The program prints a sequence of operations that do not change the matrix content, leading to unnecessary operations. For example, for `n = 2`, the expected operations to maximize the sum are:
    ```
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    ```
  - However, the program prints additional operations that are not needed:
    ```
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    2 2 1 2
    ```
  - This results in more than 2n operations, violating the constraint.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix within the specified constraints. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
