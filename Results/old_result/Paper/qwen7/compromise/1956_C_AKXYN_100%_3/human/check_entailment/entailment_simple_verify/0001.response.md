### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The given program initializes the matrix `mat` such that each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\). This is done correctly using `list(range(1, n + 1))` for each row.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the matrix elements using the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\), which simplifies to \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i^2 + 3i + 1)\).
   - However, this formula is incorrect. The correct sum of all elements in the matrix after performing the operations should be \(n^2 \times \frac{n+1}{2}\), because each element in the matrix will be one of the integers from 1 to \(n^2\), and the average value of these integers is \(\frac{n^2 + 1}{2}\).

4. **Operations Execution**:
   - The program prints the required number of operations (which is \(2n\)) to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It performs \(n\) row operations and \(n\) column operations, each setting the elements to a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\).
   - The operations are printed in a way that ensures each element in the matrix is set to a unique value from 1 to \(n^2\), thus achieving the maximum possible sum.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the details of each operation. The format matches the requirements of the problem.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- The annotated code shows that the matrix `mat` is correctly initialized with permutations of integers from 1 to \(n\).
- The sum calculation is incorrect, as explained above.
- The operations are correctly performed, but the sum calculation is flawed.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix elements. The provided sum calculation formula is incorrect, and the actual maximum sum should be \(n^2 \times \frac{n+1}{2}\).

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
