Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is an empty string, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string, `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, and `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(26):
        if char_count[j] == a[i]:
            s += chr(j + ord('a'))
            char_count[j] += 1
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is `i` is 0, `j` is 25, `n` must be at least 1, `char_count[j]` for each `j` from 0 to 25 is increased by the count of occurrences of the character corresponding to `a[i]` (which is 'a'), and `s` is equal to 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' (26 'a's).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 3`, `char_count` is a list of integers where each element has been incremented by 3, `a` is a list of integers, and `s` is the string 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' repeated 3 times, which is 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'. The loop iterates 26 times, and for each iteration, it finds the corresponding `j` value such that `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, increments `char_count[j]` by 1, appends the character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet to `s`, and breaks out of the loop. Since `i` starts at 1 and there are 26 iterations, `i` will eventually reach 26, but since the loop only runs 26 times and `i` increments by 1 each time, `i` will never actually reach 26 within these iterations. Therefore, the final state after all iterations is that each `char_count[j]` is incremented by 3, `s` contains 78 'a's, and `a` remains unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `char_count` will have each value incremented by 3, `s` will be a string of 78 'a's, and `a` will remain as it was initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 26, j is 25, n must be greater than 26, s is equal to 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy', and char_count[3] is 1, char_count[4] to char_count[25] are each 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
