Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 0; `n` must be at least 1; `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[0] + 1`; `s` is equal to 'a'**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 0, `char_count[j]` which was initially equal to `a[i]` (where `i` is 0), is now `a[0] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
