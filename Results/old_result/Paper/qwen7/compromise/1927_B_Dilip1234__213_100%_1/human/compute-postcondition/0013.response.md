Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 2; `n` must be at least 1; `char_count[j]` is 2; `s` is equal to 'ab'.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables or affect the conditions of the initial state. It simply exits the current loop or block of code, but since no such block was provided, the variables remain unchanged.
