Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 2; `n` must be at least 1; `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[0] + 2`; `s` is equal to 'ab'; `char_count[j]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code increments `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2 and `char_count[j]` was initially equal to `a[i] + 1`, and since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Therefore, `char_count[j]` was initially `a[0] + 1`. After incrementing by 1, `char_count[j]` becomes `a[0] + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
