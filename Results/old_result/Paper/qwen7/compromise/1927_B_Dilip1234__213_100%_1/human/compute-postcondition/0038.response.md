Output State: **`char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 3`, `char_count` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the string `s` plus the character corresponding to index `j` in the alphabet.**

Explanation: Initially, `char_count[j]` was set to `a[i] + 2`. After executing `char_count[j] += 1`, the value of `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, making it `a[i] + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
