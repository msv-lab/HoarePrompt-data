You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `k` remains an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is the length of `b`, and `n` is not equal to 2.
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `k` remains an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is the length of `b`, and `n` is not equal to 2.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and runs until `i` is less than `l` (the length of the binary representation of `n`). For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to `ans`. Since `i` starts at 2 and increments by the default value of 1 for each iteration, the loop will append `2 ** 2`, `2 ** 3`, and so on, up to `2 ** (l-1)`. Given the initial `ans` is `[2, 3]`, after the loop, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 8]`.
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is a list containing `[2 ** 0, 2 ** 1, 2 ** 2, ..., 2 ** (lk - 2)]`, `lk` is the length of `bk`
        #
        #In simpler terms, after the loop executes, `ans` will contain a list of powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is a list containing `[2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** (lk), 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)]`.
    #State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `l` is the length of `b`, and `ans` is a list containing `[2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string '2', followed by the value of `k + 1`, then '2 * k + 1', and finally '2' joined by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string starting with '2', followed by the value of `k + 1`, then '2 * k + 1', and finally '2' joined by spaces.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns a string '2', followed by the value of `k + 1`, then '2 * k + 1', and finally '2' joined by spaces.
