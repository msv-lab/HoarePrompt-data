Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop runs from `range(lk - 1)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `lk - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `lk - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `lk` must be greater than 1.

3. **Check the given states**:
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1.
   - `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `lk` is the length of `bk`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `lk` (the length of `bk`) must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `lk > 1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `lk` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lk` must be greater than 1**
