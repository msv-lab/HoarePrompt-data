Postcondition: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `l` is the length of `b`, and `ans` is a list containing `[2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** (l - k), 2 ** (l - k + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)]`.**

Explanation: 
- If `k` is 1, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 8]` as described in the if part.
- If `k` is not 1, `ans` is constructed by starting with `[2, k + 1]` and then appending terms of the form `2 ** (l - i)` for `i` from `k` to `l - 1`.
