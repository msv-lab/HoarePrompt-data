### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` must have a subsequence that sums to them.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - Functions 1-14 are not directly related to solving the problem.
   - Function 15 reads the number of test cases and calls function 14 for each test case.
   - Function 14 is the core function that generates the required sequence.

3. **Function 14 Analysis**:
   - It reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary representation.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n` is 2.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence `ans`:
     - For `k == 1`, it uses powers of 2 to ensure no subsequence sums to 1.
     - For general `k`, it constructs a sequence that avoids summing to `k` while ensuring all other sums from 1 to `n` are possible.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence construction logic seems correct for handling both special and general cases.
   - It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by avoiding certain values.
   - It ensures all other sums from 1 to `n` are possible by carefully choosing values.

5. **Output**:
   - The function outputs the sequence in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
