The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with `b` not equal to 0 and `a` greater than or equal to `b`). It performs the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Depending on the inputs, it returns either `(1, 0, 0)` when `b` is 0, or `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` which represents the GCD along with related coefficients.
