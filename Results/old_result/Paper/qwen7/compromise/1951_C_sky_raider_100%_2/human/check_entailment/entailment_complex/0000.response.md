Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` along with the list of ticket prices `a`.
2. The list `a` is sorted, which is necessary for the algorithm to work correctly.
3. The variable `t` is used to keep track of the cumulative increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases.
4. The variable `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k` for each day, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are purchased on any single day.
5. The variable `c` accumulates the total cost of purchasing tickets, taking into account the cumulative increase in price due to previous purchases.
6. The loop iterates through each day, updating `t`, `s`, and `c` accordingly.
7. The final output is the total cost `c` for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum spending required to purchase exactly `k` tickets across `n` days, considering the constraints on daily purchases and the cumulative price increase.

Correctness: **True**
