### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days.
   - Each day has a price `a_i` for each ticket.
   - A person can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
   - Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets for all subsequent days by `x`.

2. **Key Points in the Given Solution:**
   - The solution sorts the list of ticket prices (`l`) in ascending order.
   - It iterates through each day, buying up to `m` tickets at the current price.
   - It updates the total cost and the number of tickets bought accordingly.
   - It handles the increase in ticket price after purchasing tickets on a particular day.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It sorts the ticket prices, which is a good strategy to minimize costs.
   - The loop iterates through each day, buying up to `m` tickets at the current price.
   - The total cost is updated correctly, and the number of tickets bought is reduced.
   - The logic for updating the ticket price after buying tickets is handled within the loop.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the case where `k` is greater than `m * n`, but it should handle the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m * n`.
   - The solution correctly handles the scenario where the number of tickets left to buy is less than `m` on any day.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the solution.
   - The solution logic matches the problem constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraints and rules provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
