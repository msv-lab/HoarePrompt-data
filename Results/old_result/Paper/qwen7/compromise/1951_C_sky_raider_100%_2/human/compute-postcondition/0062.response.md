Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`**

Explanation: The code `s = min(m, k)` assigns the value of the minimum between `m` and `k` to `s`. Since the values of `m` and `k` are not specified in the initial state, `s` will be the minimum of these two values. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
