Output State: **`l` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `n * s`, `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.
