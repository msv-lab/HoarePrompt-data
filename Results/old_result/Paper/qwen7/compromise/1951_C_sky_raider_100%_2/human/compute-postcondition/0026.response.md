Output State: **`c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `n * s`, `i` is `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This changes the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, but does not affect the values of `c`, `l`, `s`, `t`, or `i`. The initial conditions for `c`, `l`, `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
