Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is 0, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `c` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the minimum value between `m` and `k`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `n * s` from it.
