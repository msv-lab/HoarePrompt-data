Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `t` is 0, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, `i` is `n + 1`, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `c = 0` initializes the variable `c` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `i`, `l`, and `k` are unchanged except for the fact that `k` is decreased by `n * s`. Since `s` is 0, `k` remains unchanged. The value of `c` is explicitly set to 0.
