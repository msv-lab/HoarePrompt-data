Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of `int(input())`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.
   - `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`.
   - `t` is `n * s`.
   - `k` is decreased by `n * s`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` would have reached the value of `int(input())`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n + 1` (which is the initial value before the loop starts).

5. **Final State**:
   - `c` remains unchanged because the loop has completed all its iterations.
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is derived from `m` and `k`, and these values are not modified within the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged for the same reason as `s`.
   - `k` remains unchanged because the loop has completed and no further modifications are made to `k`.
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1` to check if the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is `n * s`, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, `i` is `n + 1`**.
