Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer, which is initially `m - n * s`.
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
   - `t` is initialized to `n * s`.
   - `c` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`:
     - `s` is updated to be the minimum of `m` and `k` (which decreases with each iteration).
     - `t` is updated to `n * s`.
     - `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to itself.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `c` will be the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.
   - Since `t` is always `n * s` and `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each step, the value of `c` can be described as follows:
     - Initially, `s = min(m, k)`.
     - After the first iteration, `s` becomes `min(m - s, k - s)`, and so on.
     - By the end of the loop, `s` will be the minimum value of `m` and `k` after all subtractions.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The final value of `c` will be the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Since `t` is `n * s` and `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each step, the expression simplifies to:
     \[
     c = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s \cdot (l[i] + n \cdot s)
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     c = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s \cdot l[i] + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} n \cdot s^2
     \]
     \[
     c = s \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} l[i] + n \cdot s^2 \cdot n
     \]
     \[
     c = s \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} l[i] + n^2 \cdot s^2
     \]

Given this breakdown, the final value of `c` depends on the specific values of `l`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, since the exact values are not provided, we can describe the final value of `c` in terms of these variables.

Output: **c (where c is the sum of s * (l[i] + n * s) for each i from 0 to n-1, with s being the minimum of m and k after each iteration)**
