Output State: **`total` is 0, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is 0, `n` must be less than or equal to -1**

The code `s = min(m, k)` assigns the value of the minimum between `m` and `k` to `s`. Since `m` and `k` are not defined in the initial state, `s` is assigned the minimum value between `m` and `k`. The other variables (`total`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
