encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is the length of encoded and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
