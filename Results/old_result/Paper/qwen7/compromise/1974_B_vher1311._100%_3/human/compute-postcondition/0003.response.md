The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns a new string where each character in the `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character as defined in the 'mapping' dictionary, with the mapping following the rule that keys (characters from 'r' in ascending order) map to values (characters from 'r' in descending order).

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced according to a specific mapping rule involving characters from 'r' in ascending and descending orders.**
