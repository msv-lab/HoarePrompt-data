Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `r` is a string containing each unique character from `encoded` sorted in ascending order; `mapping` is a dictionary where keys are characters from `r` in ascending order and values are characters from `r` in descending order.**

Explanation: The code creates a dictionary named `mapping` where each key is a character from the string `r` (which contains all unique characters from `encoded` sorted in ascending order) and the corresponding value is the character from `r` that is at the same position but counted from the end (i.e., in descending order). For example, if `r` is "abc", then `mapping` will be {'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}.
