Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The `func_1` function:
   - Constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the input string `encoded`.
   - Creates a mapping where each character in `r` (in ascending order) maps to its corresponding character in `r` (in descending order).
   - Replaces each character in the input string `encoded` according to this mapping.
3. The logic in `func_1` accurately implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.
4. The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem requirements and the provided example works as expected.

Given these points, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
