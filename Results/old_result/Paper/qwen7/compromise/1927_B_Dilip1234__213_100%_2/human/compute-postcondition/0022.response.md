To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- The final value of `s` will be a string composed of characters corresponding to indices in the `char_count` list where the value equals `a[i]`.
- For each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` (where `j` is the index in the `char_count` list) will be appended to `s` if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`.
- After appending, `char_count[j]` will be incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `char_count`) will retain their final values post-loop execution.

Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.

The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change in `i`, while `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before, `a` is the same as before, `char_count` is the same as before, and `s` is the final value of `s` from the previous iteration.**
