Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is an index, `a` is a list of integers, `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 1`, `s` is a string that now includes the character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that was being executed. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, `char_count[j]`, and `s` remain unchanged. We also note that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
