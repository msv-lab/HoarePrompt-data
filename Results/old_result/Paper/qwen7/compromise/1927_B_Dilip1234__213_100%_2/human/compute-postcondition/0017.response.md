Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`; `s` is the current value of `s` plus the character corresponding to `j + 1` in the alphabet starting from 'a'; `char_count[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. The values of `j` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states, where `j` is `j + 1` and `s` is the current value of `s` plus the character corresponding to `j + 1` in the alphabet starting from 'a'.
