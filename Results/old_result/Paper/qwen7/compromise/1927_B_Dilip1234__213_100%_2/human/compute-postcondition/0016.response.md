Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`; `s` is the current value of `s` plus the character corresponding to `j + 1` in the alphabet starting from 'a'**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to `j + 1` in the alphabet (starting from 'a'). The value of `j` remains `j + 1` from its initial state, and `s` now includes the character that corresponds to the updated value of `j`.
