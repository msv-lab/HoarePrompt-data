Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is an empty string, n is a positive integer, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n; char_count is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(26):
        if char_count[j] == a[i]:
            s += chr(j + ord('a'))
            char_count[j] += 1
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final value of `s` will be a string composed of characters corresponding to indices in the `char_count` list where the value equals `a[i]`. Specifically, for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` (where `j` is the index in the `char_count` list) will be appended to `s` if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`. After appending, `char_count[j]` will be incremented by 1. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `char_count`) will retain their final values post-loop execution.

In simpler terms, the final output state of `s` will be a string built by checking each element in the `char_count` list against the corresponding value in the list `a`. If they match, the corresponding lowercase letter is added to `s`, and the count in `char_count` for that letter is incremented. The exact content of `s` depends on the values in `a` and `char_count` as the loop progresses through its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all 26 iterations, `i` is still `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` has been incremented 26 times, so it is now 25 (if it started from 0), `a` is a list of integers, `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 26` if the condition `char_count[j] == a[i]` was met for each `j` from 0 to 25, `s` is a string that now includes the characters corresponding to `j` in the alphabet for each `j` where `char_count[j] == a[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
