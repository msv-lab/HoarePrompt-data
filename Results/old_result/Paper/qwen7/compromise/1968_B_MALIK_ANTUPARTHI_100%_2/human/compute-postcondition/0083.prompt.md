Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 1, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is a new string input from the user, `e` is the new string input from the user, `j` is `b`, `k` is 0, `d` is a new string input from the user, `e` is the new string input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `b`, and `k` is equal to `j`. Whether `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` or not, `k` is now equal to `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` is greater than 0, `j` is `b-1`. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to either `j + 1` (if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`), or it remains as `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` (if no condition is met). If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` is greater than 0, `j` is `b`, and `k` is `b`. Whether the condition `d[j] in e[k:]` is true or false, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
