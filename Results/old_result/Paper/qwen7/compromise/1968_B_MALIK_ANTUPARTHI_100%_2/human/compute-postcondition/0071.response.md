Postcondition: `b` is greater than 0, `j` is `b-1`. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to either `j + 1` (if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`), or it remains as `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` (if no condition is met). If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
