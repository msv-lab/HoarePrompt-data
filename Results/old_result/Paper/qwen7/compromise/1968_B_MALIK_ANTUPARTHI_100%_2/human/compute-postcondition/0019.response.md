Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is either updated to `j + 1` or remains `j`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the character at index `j` in `d` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then `k` remains `j`.
