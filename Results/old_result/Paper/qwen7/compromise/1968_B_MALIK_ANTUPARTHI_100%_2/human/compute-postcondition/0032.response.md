Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is `j + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Additionally, `j` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
