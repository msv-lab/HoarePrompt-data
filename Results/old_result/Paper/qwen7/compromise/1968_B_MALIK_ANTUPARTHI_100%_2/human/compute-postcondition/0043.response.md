Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 1, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b + 1` or `b** 

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
