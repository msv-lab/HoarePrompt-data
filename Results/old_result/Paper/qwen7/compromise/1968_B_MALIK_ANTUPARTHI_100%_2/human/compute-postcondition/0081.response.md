Postcondition: `b` is greater than 0, `j` is `b`, and `k` is `b`. After executing the if-else block, `k` is either `b + 1` or `b`, depending on whether the condition `d[j] in e[k:]` is true or false. Additionally, if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
