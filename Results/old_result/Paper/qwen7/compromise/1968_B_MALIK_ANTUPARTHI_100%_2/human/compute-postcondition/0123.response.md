Postcondition: `b`, `j`, and `k` are positive integers. If `d[j]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]` or if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains `b + 1` and `k` remains `b + 1`, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
