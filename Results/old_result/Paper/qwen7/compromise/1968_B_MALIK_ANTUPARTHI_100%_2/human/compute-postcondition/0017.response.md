Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is equal to `j`, `j` is between 0 and `b`-1 inclusive, and the character at index `j` in `d` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no loop or conditional statement is specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the implied context. All other variables retain their initial or input values.
