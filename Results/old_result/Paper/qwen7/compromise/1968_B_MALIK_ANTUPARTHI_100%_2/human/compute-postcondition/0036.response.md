The code `k = j` assigns the current value of `j` to `k`. Initially, `j` is `j + 1`, which means `j` is set to its previous value plus one. Since `k` was previously defined as `j + 1`, now `k` will take the same value as `j` (which is `j + 1`). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is `j + 1`**
