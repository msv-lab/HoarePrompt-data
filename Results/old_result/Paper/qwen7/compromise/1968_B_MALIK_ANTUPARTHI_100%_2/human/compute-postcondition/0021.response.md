Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is equal to `j + e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1`, and `j` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` to `j + e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1`. Here, `e[k:]` refers to the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end. `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of the character `d[j]` in this substring. This index is then added to `j` and 1, and the result is assigned to `k`. The variable `j` is also incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
