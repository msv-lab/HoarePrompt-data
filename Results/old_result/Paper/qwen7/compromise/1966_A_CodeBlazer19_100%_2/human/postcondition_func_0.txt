The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by a list of integers \( c \). It then determines the maximum frequency of any number in the list \( c \). If this maximum frequency is greater than or equal to \( k \), it outputs \( k - 1 \); otherwise, it outputs \( n \). The function returns nothing but prints the results for each test case.
