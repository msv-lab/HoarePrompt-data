Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, k, and a list c. It returns a value based on the conditions provided for these variables.**

- The function processes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100.
- It also processes a list of integers `c` where each element `c_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the numbers written on the cards.

The function's output depends on the specific logic applied to these inputs, but the primary task is to process these variables according to the given constraints and return a result based on the conditions specified.
