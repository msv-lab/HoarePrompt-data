Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a string `s` (consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10). For each test case, it checks if the number of unique characters in `s` is exactly 2. If true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then outputs either the lexicographically sorted string or its reverse, depending on which comes first alphabetically.**
