Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, and `ans` is either `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]` if `k` is 1, or `[1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2` followed by the remaining elements of the original `ans` list if `k` is not 1.**
