Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `k` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` into its binary representation and assigns it to `bk`. The binary representation of `k` is obtained using the `bin()` function, which prefixes the result with '0b'. By slicing the string from the third character onwards (`[2:]`), we remove the '0b' prefix. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state are preserved.
