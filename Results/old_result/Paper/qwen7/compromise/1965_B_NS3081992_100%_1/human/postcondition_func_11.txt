The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the maximum value in `d.keys() + 1`, an integer `da` which is a key from the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum value in `d.keys() + 1`. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, updates `tmp` to this minimum value, and sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1`. The function ultimately returns `tmp + 1`.
