Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the function `func_14` meets the requirements specified in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the function:

### Problem Requirements:
1. Given integers \( n \) and \( k \), find a sequence \( a \) of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. There should be no subsequence of \( a \) with a sum equal to \( k \).
3. For all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there must be a subsequence of \( a \) with a sum of \( v \).

### Function Analysis:
- `func_14` is designed to generate a sequence \( a \) based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
- The function handles two main cases:
  1. When \( k = 1 \):
     - If \( n = 2 \), it directly returns "1\n2".
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence where the elements are powers of 2 starting from 2 up to \( 2^l \) (where \( l \) is the length of the binary representation of \( n \)).
  2. When \( k > 1 \):
     - It constructs a sequence based on the binary representation of \( k \).
     - It includes elements that cover sums from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \).
     - It ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \).

### Verification:
- **Case 1: \( k = 1 \)**
  - If \( n = 2 \), the sequence is [2], which trivially meets the criteria.
  - For \( n > 2 \), the sequence includes powers of 2, ensuring that all sums from 1 to \( n \) except 1 can be formed, and no subsequence sums to 1.

- **Case 2: \( k > 1 \)**
  - The sequence construction ensures that all sums from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \) can be formed.
  - No subsequence sums to \( k \) because the elements are carefully chosen to avoid forming \( k \) as a sum.

Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_14` correctly generates a sequence \( a \) that meets the problem requirements for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Since `func_14` correctly implements the logic to generate a valid sequence \( a \) for all test cases, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
