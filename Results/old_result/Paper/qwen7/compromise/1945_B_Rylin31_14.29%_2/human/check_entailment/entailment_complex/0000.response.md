Reasoning:
The provided solution aims to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. However, there are a few issues with the logic used in the code.

1. **Calculation of `mn`:**
   - The variable `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`. This calculation does not correctly account for the timing of the fireworks from both installations. Instead, it should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the interval at which both installations would launch fireworks simultaneously.

2. **Divisibility Check:**
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1:` is not necessary and does not correctly handle the LCM calculation. The LCM of `a` and `b` is the smallest number that is a multiple of both `a` and `b`.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to calculate the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determine how many fireworks can be seen within the visibility period `m + 1`.

Here is the corrected approach:
- Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
- Determine the number of intervals within the visibility period `m + 1` for both installations.

Let's rewrite the function with the correct logic:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // lcm_ab
        print(max_visible)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

With this corrected approach, the function should now correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Overall Response:
Reasoning: The original solution has logical errors in calculating the LCM and determining the number of visible fireworks. The provided solution needs to be revised to correctly compute the LCM and use it to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Correctness: **False**
