Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is the sum of all `f` values obtained from the split inputs over all iterations, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values of the integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `M`, and `s`) remain unchanged in terms of their initial state, but `n`, `m`, and `k` are now updated to the values of the integers input by the user. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it was already defined before the input.
