Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is the sum of all `f` values obtained from the split inputs over all iterations, `n` and `m` are updated to the values of the integers input by the user, `k` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c` to be the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\). The other variables remain unchanged, and `n` and `m` are updated to the values of the integers input by the user. The value of `c` is now calculated based on the new values of `n` and `m`.
