Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007**

The code initializes a variable `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is 1000000007. This value does not affect the existing variables `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
