Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `1000000007`, `M` is `1000000007`, `s` is `0`, `a` is increased by `f`, `u` is the second integer from the split input, `v` is the third integer from the split input, `f` is the first integer from the split input, and `a` is now equal to `a + f`.**

Explanation: The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by the value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
