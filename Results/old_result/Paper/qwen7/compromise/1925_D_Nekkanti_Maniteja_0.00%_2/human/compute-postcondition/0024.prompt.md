Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The value of `i` will be equal to `m-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `u` is an integer entered by the user, `v` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the course of the loop's iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `m-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` will retain their most recent values entered during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `u` is an integer entered by the user, `v` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is 0, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `u` is an integer entered by the user, `v` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is 0, `s` is `c * 1 * c * m + c * 0 * c * m`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
