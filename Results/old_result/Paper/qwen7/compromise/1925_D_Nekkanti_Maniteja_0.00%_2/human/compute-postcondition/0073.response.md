Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is `c * c * m + 2 * c * m + 2 * c * a + c * a`**

Explanation: The initial state had `i` as 2, `k` greater than 0, and `s` defined as `c * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`. The code updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Given `i` is 2, the updated expression for `s` becomes `c * c * m + 2 * c * m + 2 * c * a + c * a`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
