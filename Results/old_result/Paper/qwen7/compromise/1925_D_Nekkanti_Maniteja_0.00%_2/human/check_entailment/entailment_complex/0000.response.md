Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which are the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions respectively.
   - It also initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used for modulo operations to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

2. **Calculation of Constant `c`:**
   - The constant `c` is calculated as \( c = \text{pow}(n \times (n - 1) // 1, -1, M) \).
   - This is the modular multiplicative inverse of \( n \times (n - 1) \) modulo \( M \). This is necessary because the problem involves counting the probability of selecting any pair of children, and this value helps in calculating the expected value.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the sum of all friendship values `f` provided for the pairs of friends.
   - For each of the `m` pairs, the code correctly adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values.
   - The loop iterates `k` times, and for each iteration, it updates `s` using the formula \( s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \).
   - Here, `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`, and the term \( c \times i \times c \times m \) accounts for the increase in the friendship value due to the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.
   - The term \( c \times a \) accounts for the initial sum of friendship values.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the code prints the value of `s` modulo \( M \).

Given the problem statement and the steps above, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution. It calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions and outputs the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
