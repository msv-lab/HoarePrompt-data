Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each excursion after it is chosen for the first time. Instead, it incorrectly calculates the sum using a constant factor `c` and the number of pairs `m`, which does not reflect the actual expected value calculation.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the probability of choosing each pair and how the friendship value changes over the k excursions. The program should calculate the expected value for each pair and sum these values appropriately. The current implementation does not handle this correctly and will produce incorrect results for most inputs.
