### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the program is incorrect based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program:
```python
import math

"""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**
*                      BISMILLAHIR RAHMANIR RAHEEM                         *                                                    *
**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"""
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function takes two integers \(n\) and \(k\) as input.
   - It initializes `ans` with `n`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n}\) and adds \((n + i) // (i^2)\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

2. **Key Issues:**
   - The function does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it incorrectly assumes that the pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) is fixed to some value (which is not \(k\) but rather \(i\)) will satisfy the condition.
   - The calculation \((n + i) // (i^2)\) does not reflect the correct logic for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 2\):

- Valid pairs:
  - (1, 1): \(1 + 1 = 2\), and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). Since \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
  - (2, 1): \(2 + 1 = 3\), and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). Since \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
  - (2, 2): \(2 + 2 = 4\), and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\). Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.

Thus, there are 3 valid pairs.

However, the provided program does not correctly identify these pairs. It instead calculates \((n + i) // (i^2)\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(\sqrt{n}\), which does not align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
