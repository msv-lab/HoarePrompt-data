Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates \(ans\) as \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{\sqrt{n}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\), which does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example Test Case
Consider the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 2\):

- Valid pairs:
  - \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\), and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). Since \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
  - \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\), and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). Since \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
  - \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\), and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\). Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.

Thus, there are 3 valid pairs.

### Code Logic
The code logic in `func_1`:
- It calculates \(ans = n\).
- It then iterates from \(2\) to \(\sqrt{n}\) and adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) to \(ans\).

This logic does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be attempting to count something related to the distribution of numbers up to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
