You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer x within the range of 2 to 1000 (inclusive) and searches for the largest integer y (less than x) such that y divides x without a remainder and 2*y is greater than or equal to x. If no such y exists, it returns 1. The function ultimately returns either the found y or 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the integer `y` such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - It initializes `max_val` to 1, which will store the best candidate for `y`.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 2.
   - For each `y`, it checks if `x % y == 0` (i.e., `y` is a divisor of `x`).
   - If `y` is a divisor and \(2 \cdot y \geq x\), it returns `y` immediately because this condition ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - If no such `y` is found, it returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of `x` found during the iteration.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(x)` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` is designed to find the largest divisor `y` of `x` such that \(2 \cdot y \geq x\). This ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized because \(\gcd(x, y)\) will be at least `y` (since `y` divides `x`), and adding `y` to it gives the highest possible sum.
- The loop starts from `x-1` and goes down to 2, ensuring that we check all potential candidates for `y`.
- The condition `2 * y >= x` is crucial because it ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized when `y` is large enough relative to `x`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for the given input ranges.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the integer `y` that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
