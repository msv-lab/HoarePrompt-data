Let's reason through the given program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the integer `y` such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - It initializes `max_val` to 1, which will store the best candidate for `y`.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 2.
   - For each `y`, it checks if `x % y == 0` (i.e., `y` is a divisor of `x`).
   - If `y` is a divisor and \(2 \cdot y \geq x\), it returns `y` immediately because this condition ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - If no such `y` is found, it returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of `x` found during the iteration.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(x)` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` is designed to find the largest divisor `y` of `x` such that \(2 \cdot y \geq x\). This ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized because \(\gcd(x, y)\) will be at least `y` (since `y` divides `x`), and adding `y` to it gives the highest possible sum.
- The loop starts from `x-1` and goes down to 2, ensuring that we check all potential candidates for `y`.
- The condition `2 * y >= x` is crucial because it ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized when `y` is large enough relative to `x`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for the given input ranges.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the integer `y` that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

**Correctness: True**
