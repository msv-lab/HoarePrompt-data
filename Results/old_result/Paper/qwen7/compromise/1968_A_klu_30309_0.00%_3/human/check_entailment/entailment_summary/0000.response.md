Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
2. The provided function `func_1` attempts to solve this by iterating from \( x-1 \) down to 2 and checking if \( y \) divides \( x \) without a remainder.
3. If \( y \) divides \( x \) and \( 2y \geq x \), it immediately returns \( y \). Otherwise, it keeps track of the maximum \( y \) found and returns it at the end.
4. This approach ensures that the function will return the largest \( y \) that meets the criteria, as it starts from the largest possible \( y \) and works downwards.
5. Given the constraints \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \), the function should correctly handle all valid inputs according to the problem statement.

Based on the above reasoning, the function appears to be correct and follows the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
