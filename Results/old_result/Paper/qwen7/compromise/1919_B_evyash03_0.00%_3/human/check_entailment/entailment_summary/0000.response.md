Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of times the balance (difference between the number of '+' and '-') goes negative during the iteration of the string. However, the function does not actually compute the penalty as described in the problem statement.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The problem requires calculating the penalty by splitting the array into segments where the sum of each segment is maximized to minimize the total penalty. The current implementation does not account for this requirement. Instead, it simply counts how many times the balance becomes negative, which is not relevant to the penalty calculation.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the count of times the balance becomes negative plus one if the final balance is positive. This does not align with the problem's requirements and does not provide the correct penalty value.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
