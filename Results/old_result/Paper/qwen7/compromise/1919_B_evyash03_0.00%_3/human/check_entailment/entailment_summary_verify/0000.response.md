Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), the length of the string (`length`), and the string itself (`expression`).
   - The string `expression` is split into parts based on the '-' character using `expression.split('-')`.
   - The length of these parts is summed up and stored in `result_length`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes the string `expression` and an integer `length` as arguments.
   - It initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in `expression`:
     - If the character is '+', it increments `balance` by 1.
     - If the character is '-', it decrements `balance` by 1.
     - If `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` by 1 and resets `balance` to 0.
   - After the loop, if `balance` is greater than 0, it increments `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

### Function Summary Validation

The function summary states that `func_1` counts the number of times the balance (initially set to 0) goes negative while iterating through each character in `expression`. If the final balance is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the count. The function returns this final count.

### Correctness Evaluation

To determine the correctness, let's compare the program's logic with the problem statement:

1. **Problem Statement Requirement:**
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into subarrays.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The optimal strategy involves splitting the array at points where the sum of the subarray changes sign to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program splits the string based on '-' characters, which does not necessarily correspond to the optimal splitting points.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance goes negative, which is not directly related to minimizing the total penalty.

### Example Analysis

Consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```

- The string `expression` is split into `['--', '+++++', '-']`.
- The function `func_1` will count the number of times the balance goes negative, which happens once when it encounters the '-' character after two '-' characters.
- The function returns `1 + (1 > 0) = 2`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the total penalty. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of times the balance goes negative, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
