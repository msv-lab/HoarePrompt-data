### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: A string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
2. **Array Construction**: Convert `s` into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - Split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that `b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_k = a`.
   - The penalty of a subarray `b` is `|sum(b)| * len(b)`.
   - The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.
4. **Optimal Splitting**: The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting `a`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the length `length` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String**:
   - The string `expression` is split into parts based on the `'-'` character using `parts = expression.split('-')`.
   - This results in a list of substrings where each substring consists only of `+` characters.

3. **Calculating Result Length**:
   - `result_length` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of these substrings.

4. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` is called with `expression` and `result_length` as arguments.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0.
   - `balance` is initialized to 0.
   - Iterate through each character in `expression`:
     - If `char` is `+`, increment `balance`.
     - If `char` is `-`, decrement `balance`.
     - If `balance` becomes negative, increment `count` and reset `balance` to 0.
   - Return `count + (balance > 0)`.

#### Evaluation:
- The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance of `+` and `-` characters becomes negative during the iteration through the string.
- However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty.
- The function does not take into account the actual values of the elements in the array `a` or their positions, which are crucial for determining the optimal split.

#### Example:
Consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
- The string `expression` is split into `['--', '+++++', '-']`.
- The function `func_1` will count the number of times the balance becomes negative, which is 1 (when encountering the first `-`).
- The function returns `1 + (0 > 0) = 1`.

However, the optimal split would be `['--', '+++++', '-']`, resulting in penalties:
- `|2| * 2 = 4` for `['--']`
- `|4| * 5 = 20` for `['+++++']`
- `|-1| * 1 = 1` for `['-']`
- Total penalty: `4 + 20 + 1 = 25`

The function returns `1`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
Final: **False**
