Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using `'-'` as the delimiter. This means that each part between `'-'` characters is considered a contiguous segment of `'+ '` characters.
   - `parts = expression.split('-')` results in a list of segments where each segment consists only of `'+ '` characters.

3. **Calculating Result Length:**
   - `result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))` calculates the total length of these segments. This is equivalent to counting the number of `'+ '` characters in the original string.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The program calls `func_1(expression, result_length)` with the original string and the calculated result length.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` variable which tracks the net effect of `'+ '` and `'-'` characters.
   - If at any point `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to zero.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which effectively counts the number of segments needed to split the array into non-empty segments where the sum of each segment is non-negative.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Objective:** The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array into non-empty segments.
- **Penalty Calculation:** The penalty for each segment is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- **Optimal Splitting Strategy:** The optimal strategy is to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero or positive, minimizing the penalty.

### Verification

- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the number of segments needed to achieve this optimal splitting.
- The function ensures that each segment has a non-negative sum, thereby minimizing the penalty.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
