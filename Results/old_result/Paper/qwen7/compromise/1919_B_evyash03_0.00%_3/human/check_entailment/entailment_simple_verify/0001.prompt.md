You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using `'-'` as the delimiter. This means that each part between `'-'` characters is considered a contiguous segment of `'+ '` characters.
   - `parts = expression.split('-')` results in a list of segments where each segment consists only of `'+ '` characters.

3. **Calculating Result Length:**
   - `result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))` calculates the total length of these segments. This is equivalent to counting the number of `'+ '` characters in the original string.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The program calls `func_1(expression, result_length)` with the original string and the calculated result length.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` variable which tracks the net effect of `'+ '` and `'-'` characters.
   - If at any point `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to zero.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which effectively counts the number of segments needed to split the array into non-empty segments where the sum of each segment is non-negative.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Objective:** The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array into non-empty segments.
- **Penalty Calculation:** The penalty for each segment is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- **Optimal Splitting Strategy:** The optimal strategy is to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero or positive, minimizing the penalty.

### Verification

- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the number of segments needed to achieve this optimal splitting.
- The function ensures that each segment has a non-negative sum, thereby minimizing the penalty.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
