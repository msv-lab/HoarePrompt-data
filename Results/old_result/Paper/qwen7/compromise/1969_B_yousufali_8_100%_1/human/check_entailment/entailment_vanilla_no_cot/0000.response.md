Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` assumes that every time a '0' is encountered after at least one '1', a cyclic shift operation is performed, which is not always the optimal strategy.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The optimal strategy involves identifying the longest prefix of '0's and then performing cyclic shifts to move the '1's to their correct positions.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    ones_index = [i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char == '1']
    
    if not ones_index:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Find the longest prefix of zeros
    zero_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero_count += 1
        else:
            break
    
    # Calculate the cost
    cost = 0
    for i in range(len(ones_index) - 1):
        cost += ones_index[i + 1] - ones_index[i]
    
    # Add the cost to move the last '1' to its correct position
    cost += n - ones_index[-1] + zero_count
    
    print(cost)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Call the function with input
func_2()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Identify the indices of all '1's in the string.
2. Determine the longest prefix of '0's.
3. Calculate the cost by summing the distances between consecutive '1's and adding the distance to move the last '1' to its correct position.

This approach ensures that the minimum cost to sort the binary string is calculated correctly.
