Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, and `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged unless `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, in which case it is set to `False`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged unless `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, in which case it is set to `False`, `j` is 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, `counter` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, the loop or if-else block has been fully executed according to the conditions provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `counter` is 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged, `j` is 1, and if `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, `counter` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1, and if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, the same conditions hold as in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `counter`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, and `j` remain unchanged, and if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `counter` is incremented to 2 when `a[j + 1] != '0'` or `b[j] != '1'`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
