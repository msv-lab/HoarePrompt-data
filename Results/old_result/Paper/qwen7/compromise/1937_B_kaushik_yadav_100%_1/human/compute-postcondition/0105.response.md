Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0] + b[2]`, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `b[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 2 and has now been incremented (as part of the operation), `i` is now 3. Since `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `b[2]` corresponds to the third character in the string. `ans` was initially `a[0]`, so after adding `b[2]`, `ans` becomes `a[0] + b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
