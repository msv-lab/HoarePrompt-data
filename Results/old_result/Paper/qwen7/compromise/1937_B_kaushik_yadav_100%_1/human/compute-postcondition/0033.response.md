Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with the character `b[i]` appended to it, and `work` is a boolean, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work`. The `i` remains as `i + 1`, `n` stays as an input integer, `a` and `b` remain unchanged (as they are strings), `ans` remains a string with the character `b[i]` appended to it, and `work` remains a boolean. The `break` statement only indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block.
