Postcondition: `counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits. `i` is either `i + 1` or the index where the loop breaks, depending on the condition inside the if-else block. `work` is either True or False based on the condition inside the if-else block. `len(a)` must be greater than 2. `ans` is the concatenation of `ans` and either `b[i]` (if the loop breaks) or `a[i]` (if the loop continues).
