Postcondition: `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False based on the conditions inside the if-else blocks, `ans` is the final concatenated string formed by adding characters from `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified within the loop, `j` is 4, and if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is true, then `ans` is updated accordingly, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
