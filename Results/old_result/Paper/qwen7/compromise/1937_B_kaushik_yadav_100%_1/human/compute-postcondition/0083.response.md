Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement immediately preceding the `break` in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
