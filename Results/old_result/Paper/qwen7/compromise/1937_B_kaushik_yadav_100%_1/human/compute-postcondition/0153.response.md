Postcondition: `counter` is 1, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is a string constructed according to the rules defined within the loop, `work` is False, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 4, **the current value of `a[j + 1]` is equal to the current value of `b[j]`**.
