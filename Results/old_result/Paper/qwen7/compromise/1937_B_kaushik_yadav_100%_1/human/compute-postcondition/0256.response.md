Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False based on the conditions inside the if-else blocks, `ans` is the final concatenated string formed by adding characters from `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified within the loop, `j` is 1, and `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` if `counter` is 2, otherwise `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`.
