Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input from `sys.stdin.readline` and it is given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the loop will definitely execute if `t` is within this range.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `t` allows the loop to execute. Given that `t` is a positive integer and the loop will run as long as `t > 0`, we need to set `t` to a value that is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a positive integer, which it already is according to the problem statement.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected.
