Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string, and `work` is a boolean. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `work` is `False`. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` is the concatenation of its original value and `b[i]`. If `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` is the first character of `a`, and `work` is `False`. If `i` is 2, then `ans` is the first character of `b`, and `work` is `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `i` is incremented, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with either the character `a[i-1]` or `b[i]` appended to it, and `work` is a boolean. If `work` is true and `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` contains the character `b[i]`; otherwise, `ans` contains the character `a[i-1]` and `i` is incremented by 2. If `work` is false, `ans` contains the character `b[i-1]` and `i` is incremented by 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a string with either the character `a[i-1]` or `b[i]` appended to it, depending on the value of `work`. `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, and `work` remains unchanged unless `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, in which case `work` is set to `False`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
