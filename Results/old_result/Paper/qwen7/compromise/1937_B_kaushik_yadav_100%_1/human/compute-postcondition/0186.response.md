Output State: **`counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits. The variable `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace. The values of `i`, `a`, `ans`, `work`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.**

The code `b = input().strip()` reads an input string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The other variables (`counter`, `j`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `ans`, `work`, and `t`) are not affected by this operation. The value of `counter` remains as it was determined in the previous iterations based on the conditions specified.
