Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input from `sys.stdin.readline`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `counter` is 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged, `j` is 2, and the loop has completed all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits. The variable `j` is incremented by 1 for each full iteration of the loop. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `counter` will reflect the cumulative count based on the conditions specified, with `j` being updated accordingly, while all other variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will continue executing as long as `a[j + 1] == b[j]` or `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`. After all iterations, `counter` will be the maximum value it reaches during the loop, which could be 1 or 2 depending on the sequence of characters in `a` and `b`. The variable `i` remains equal to the length of `a`. The variable `work` is either True or False based on the conditions inside the if-else blocks. The variable `ans` is the final concatenated string formed by adding characters from `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified within the loop. The variable `j` will be equal to `len(a) - 1` after all iterations, and the loop will exit.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
