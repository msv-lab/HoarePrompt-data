Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0]`, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
