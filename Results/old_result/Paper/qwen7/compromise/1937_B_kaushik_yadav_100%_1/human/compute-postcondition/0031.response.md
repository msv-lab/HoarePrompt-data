Output State: **`work` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with the character `a[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `work` to `False`. No other changes are made to the other variables, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
