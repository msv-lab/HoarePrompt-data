Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `a` is unchanged.**

The code `i = 0` sets the variable `i` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
