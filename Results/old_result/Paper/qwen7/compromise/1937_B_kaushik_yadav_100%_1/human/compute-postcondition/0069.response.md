Output State: **`counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged unless `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, in which case it is set to `False`, `j` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, and `(a[j + 1] != '0' or b[j] != '1')`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. All the initial conditions remain the same after the `break` statement is executed.
