Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged unless `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, in which case it is set to `False`, `j` is 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, and `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`**.

The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Initially, `counter` was 1, so now it is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
