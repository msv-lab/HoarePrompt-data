Output State: **`counter` is 1, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `t` retain their original states**.

This means that the variable `counter` has been explicitly set to 1. All other variables (`j`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `t`) remain unchanged from their original states.
