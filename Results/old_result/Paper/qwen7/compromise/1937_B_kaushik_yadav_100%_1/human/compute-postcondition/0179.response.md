Postcondition: **`counter` is either 3 or 1, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `t` retain their original states. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is either 4 or 2. If `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.**
