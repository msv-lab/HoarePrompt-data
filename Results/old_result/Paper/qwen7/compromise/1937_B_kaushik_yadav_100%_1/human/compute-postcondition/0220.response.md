Postcondition: **`counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits. `i` is either 4 or 2 depending on the condition inside the if-else block. `work` is either True or False based on the condition inside the if-else block. `len(a)` must be greater than 0. `ans` is now the concatenation of `ans` and `b[i]` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, or `ans` is now the concatenation of `ans` and `a[i]` otherwise.**
