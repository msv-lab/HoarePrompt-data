Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and two binary strings of length n representing the values of a_{1j} and a_{2j} for 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The function returns a result based on the given test cases.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases where each case involves a positive integer t, an integer n, and two binary strings of length n. The function then calculates or determines something based on these inputs and returns the result accordingly.
