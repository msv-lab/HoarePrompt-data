Output State: **`counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits. The variable `j` is incremented by 1 for each full iteration of the loop. The value of `n` is an input integer. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. `a` is updated to the input string after stripping whitespace.**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been updated to the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
