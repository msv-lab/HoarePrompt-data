Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `work` is False**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes the first character of `b`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
