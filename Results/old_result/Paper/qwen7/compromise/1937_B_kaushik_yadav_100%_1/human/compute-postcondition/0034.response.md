Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with the character `a[i-1]` appended to it, and `work` is a boolean.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i + 2` since it was initially `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
