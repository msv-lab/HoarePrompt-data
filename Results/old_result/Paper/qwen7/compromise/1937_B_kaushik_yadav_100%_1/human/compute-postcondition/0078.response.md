Postcondition: `counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged, `j` is 1, and if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, the same conditions hold as in the else part.
