Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case without needing to be explicitly called with parameters within the function definition itself.
