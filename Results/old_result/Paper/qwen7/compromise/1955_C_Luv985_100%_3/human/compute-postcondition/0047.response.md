Output State: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is incremented by 1 (so ans = ans + 1), `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` is increased by 1.**

In this case, the line `ans += 1` simply increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
