Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is either decreased by `2 * mi` or remains unchanged, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
