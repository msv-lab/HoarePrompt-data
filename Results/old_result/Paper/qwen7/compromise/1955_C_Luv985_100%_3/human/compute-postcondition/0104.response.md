Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `ans + 1` depending on whether `a[l]` was 0, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` and is less than or equal to half of `k`. The current value of `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
