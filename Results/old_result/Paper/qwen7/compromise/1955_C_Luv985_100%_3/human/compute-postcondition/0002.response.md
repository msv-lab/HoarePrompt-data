Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `T`.
2. **Determine the current state of `T`**: According to the given state right before the loop, `T` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the requirement for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `T` must be true (non-zero).

Given that `T` is an input integer, the only way to ensure the loop executes the first time is to make sure `T` is non-zero.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `T` to ensure it is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` must be non-zero**
