Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The variable `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`, where `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
