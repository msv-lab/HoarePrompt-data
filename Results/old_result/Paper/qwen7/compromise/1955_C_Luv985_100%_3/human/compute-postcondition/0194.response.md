Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `min(a[0], a[r])`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[r]` by the value of `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
