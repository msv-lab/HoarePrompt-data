Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using `map` and `lambda`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string in the list `a` into an integer using the `map` function with a lambda function that converts each string `x` to an integer. The initial state of `T` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The variables `n` and `k` are not changed by this code. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `T` being `T - 1`, `n` as an integer from the input, `k` as an integer from the input, and `a` now being a list of integers derived from the original list of strings.
