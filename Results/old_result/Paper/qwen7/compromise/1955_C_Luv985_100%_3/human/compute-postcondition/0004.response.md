Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is a string from the input, `k` is a string from the input**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two strings and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The value of `T` is `T - 1` from the initial state, and no other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, `T` remains as `T - 1`, while `n` and `k` are assigned the respective strings from the input.
