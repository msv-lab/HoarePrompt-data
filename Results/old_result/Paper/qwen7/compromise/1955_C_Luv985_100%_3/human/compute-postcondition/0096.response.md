Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]`) is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` and is less than or equal to half of `k`**.

This means that the value of `a[r]` (which is the last element of the list `a`) has been decreased by `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
