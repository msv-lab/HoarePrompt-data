Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is adjusted according to the following rules: if `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` becomes `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` remains the same, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` to 0, `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `k` is reduced to `k - t` where `t` is `k % 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
