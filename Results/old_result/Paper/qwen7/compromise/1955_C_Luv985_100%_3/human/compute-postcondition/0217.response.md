Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1 to 1, `l` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states as described.
