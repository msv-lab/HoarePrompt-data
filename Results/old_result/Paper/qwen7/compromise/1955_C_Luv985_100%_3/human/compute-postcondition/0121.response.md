Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was set to 1. After executing this line, `l` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
