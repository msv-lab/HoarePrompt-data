Output State: **`k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` < `r`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are already adjusted by subtracting `mi` from them. The conditions `l < r` and `mi` being the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` remain unchanged.
