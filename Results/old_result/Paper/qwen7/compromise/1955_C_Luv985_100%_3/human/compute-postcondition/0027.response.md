Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` to 0, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `r`.
