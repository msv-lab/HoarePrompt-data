Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` to 0 or remains unchanged, `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, and if `mi * 2 > k`, `k` is reduced to `k % 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the condition `mi * 2 <= k` for the if part and the default case for the else part. It ensures that the values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `ans`, `l`, and `r` are correctly updated according to the respective conditions and actions taken within the if-else block.
