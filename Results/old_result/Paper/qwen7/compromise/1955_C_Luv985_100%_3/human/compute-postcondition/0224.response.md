Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is either decreased by `2 * mi` (where `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`) and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1, or `k` remains unchanged, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
