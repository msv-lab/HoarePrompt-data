The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), followed by integers \( n \) and \( k \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ 10^15), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of operations needed to reduce all elements in the list \( a \) to zero, where each operation consists of subtracting the same positive integer from two elements of the list. If an element becomes zero during an operation, it is removed from consideration. The function returns nothing explicitly but prints the result for each test case.
