Output State: **`i` is 9, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
