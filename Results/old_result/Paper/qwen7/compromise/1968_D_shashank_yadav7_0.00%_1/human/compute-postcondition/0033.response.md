Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `i` is 0, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` twice, `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Since `sp` was already increased by `a[s]` before this line of code, it is now increased by `a[s]` again. Therefore, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` twice. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
