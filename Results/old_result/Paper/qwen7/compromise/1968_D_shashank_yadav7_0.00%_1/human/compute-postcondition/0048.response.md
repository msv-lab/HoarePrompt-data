Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `k` is -2
- `s` is adjusted based on the list `p`, but the exact value of `s` is not specified.
- `sp` has been incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times.
- `bp` has been incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times.
- `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp` (this calculation is done twice).
- `sm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp` (this calculation is done twice).
- The condition `bm > sm` is true.

The `print('Bodya')` statement will print the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **'Bodya'**
