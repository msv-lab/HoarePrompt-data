Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `k` is -2, `s` is adjusted based on the list `p`, `sp` has been incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times, `bp` has been incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times, `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp` (this calculation is done twice), `sm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp` (this calculation is done twice), and the condition `bm > sm` is true.**
