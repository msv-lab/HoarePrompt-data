Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `i` is 2, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b] * 2`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is -2, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` twice, `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. All the variables retain their initial conditions and values from the initial state.
