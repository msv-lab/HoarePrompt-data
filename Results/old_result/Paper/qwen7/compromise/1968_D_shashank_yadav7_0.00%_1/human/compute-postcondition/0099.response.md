Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` is 4, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, and `sm`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
