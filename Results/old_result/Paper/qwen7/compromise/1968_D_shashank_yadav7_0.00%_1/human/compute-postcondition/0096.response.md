Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` is 4, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to `p[s] - 1`. However, since the initial value of `s` is not provided and the value of `p[s]` is also not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `s`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `s` as `p[s] - 1`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
