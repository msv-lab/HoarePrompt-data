Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes inputs through variables t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, n and P_B are integers between 1 and 2â‹…10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, P_S is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, p is a list of n integers each between 1 and n inclusive, and a is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
