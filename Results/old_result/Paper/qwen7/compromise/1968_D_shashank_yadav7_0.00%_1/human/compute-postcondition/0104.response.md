Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 7.
- `k` is -2.
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
- `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- `bm` is greater than `sm`.
- `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- `sp` is `a[s] + sp`.
- `bp` is `a[b] + bp`.

The print statement is `print('Bodya')`.

The print statement directly outputs the string `'Bodya'`. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, and the string is explicitly provided within the print function, the output is simply the string itself.

Output: **Bodya**
