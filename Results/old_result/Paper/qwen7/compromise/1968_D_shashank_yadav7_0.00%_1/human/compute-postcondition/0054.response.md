Based on the initial state and the given conditions, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is -2.
   - `s` is adjusted based on the list `p`, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `sp` has been incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times.
   - `bp` has been incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times.
   - `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`.
   - `sm` has been incremented by the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`.
   - The loop breaks when `k` reaches 0, with the condition that `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

2. **Understanding the loop behavior:**
   - Since `k` starts at -2 and the loop breaks when `k` reaches 0, the loop will run until `k` becomes 0.
   - Given that `k` is -2 initially, it will increment by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0, meaning the loop will run 2 times.

3. **Effect of the loop on variables:**
   - `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the value of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, three times each due to the loop running twice.
   - `bm` and `sm` are updated based on the maximum of their current values and certain calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp` for `bm`, and `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp` for `sm`.

4. **Final values of `bm` and `sm`:**
   - Since `k` is -2 and the loop runs until `k` becomes 0, the condition `bm >= sm` must hold true for the loop to break.
   - Without the exact values of `a[s]`, `a[b]`, and the list `p`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `bm` and `sm`. However, we know they are updated based on the given conditions.

Given the information, the print statement `print('Draw')` will execute and print the string "Draw".

Output: **Draw**
