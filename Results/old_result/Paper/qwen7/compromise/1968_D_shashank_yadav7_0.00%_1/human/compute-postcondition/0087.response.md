Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**

Explanation: The code `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` updates the value of `sm` by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to it. However, the values of `a[s]`, `sp`, and `k` are not explicitly given, so we cannot simplify `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` further. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
