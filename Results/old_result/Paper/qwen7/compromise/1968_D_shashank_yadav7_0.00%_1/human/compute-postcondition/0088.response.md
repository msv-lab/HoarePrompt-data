Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `2 * a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**

Explanation: The line `sp += a[s]` adds the value of `a[s]` to `sp`. Since `sp` was previously `a[s] + sp`, adding `a[s]` to `sp` results in `2 * a[s] + sp`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `bp`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
