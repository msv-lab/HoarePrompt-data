Output State: `i` is 14, `k` is -3, `b` is `p[b] - 3`, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp + a[b] + a[b]`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., when `i` reaches 14), the variable `i` increments by 1 for each iteration of the loop, starting from 8. The variable `k` decreases by 1 in each iteration until it becomes -3. The variable `b` and `s` are updated based on the list `p` for each iteration, with `b` being updated twice as much as `s`. The variables `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` are updated according to their respective formulas within the loop body, accumulating the maximum values and sums as described.
