Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times, `bp` is incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times, `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and splits it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `p`. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `n`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged from their initial states.
