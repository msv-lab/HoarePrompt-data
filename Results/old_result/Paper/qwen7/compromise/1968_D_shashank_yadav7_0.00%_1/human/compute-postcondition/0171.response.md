Postcondition: `i` is 14, `k` is -3, `b` is `p[b] - 3`, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `bm` is updated to `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)` in both cases, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp + a[b] + a[b]`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `bm` remains unchanged.
