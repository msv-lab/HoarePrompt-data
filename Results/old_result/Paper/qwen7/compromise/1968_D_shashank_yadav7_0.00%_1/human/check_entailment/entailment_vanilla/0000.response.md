Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (the length of the permutation, duration of the game, Bodya's starting position, and Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The program correctly adjusts `b` and `s` to zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from each.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - It initializes `sp` (Sasha's initial score) and `bp` (Bodya's initial score) with the scores at their starting positions.
   - It also initializes `bm` (Bodya's maximum possible score) and `sm` (Sasha's maximum possible score) with the initial scores multiplied by `k`.

4. **Game Loop:**
   - The loop runs `k` times, simulating each turn.
   - In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha to their new positions using the permutation `p`.
   - It calculates the new scores for both players and updates `bm` and `sm` with the maximum possible scores considering the remaining turns.
   - It also adds the scores from the current positions to `sp` and `bp`.

5. **Final Comparison:**
   - After the loop, it compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Scores:**
   - The logic to calculate `bm` and `sm` is flawed. The program should consider the maximum possible scores for each player at each turn, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.
   - Specifically, the program should keep track of the maximum score each player can achieve from their current position to the end of the game, considering all possible moves.

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Use of `k`:**
   - The variable `k` is being decremented in the loop, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Instead, the program should simulate each turn independently without decrementing `k`.

3. **Logic Flaw in Score Updates:**
   - The program incorrectly updates `bm` and `sm` by adding the maximum of the current score and the score from moving to the new position. This does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
