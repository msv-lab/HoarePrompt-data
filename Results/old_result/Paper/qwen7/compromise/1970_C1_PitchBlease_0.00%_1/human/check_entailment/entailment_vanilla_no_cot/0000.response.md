Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The program attempts to determine the winner based on the distances from the starting node to the two leaves. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't account for the optimal moves that Ron and Hermione would make during the game.

2. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The program calculates the distance from the starting node to the two leaves and checks if any of these distances are even. If so, it concludes that Ron wins. This is not correct because the game involves optimal play by both players, and simply checking distances does not capture the strategic nature of the game.

3. **Missing Game State Management**: The program does not simulate the actual game rounds where Ron and Hermione take turns making moves. Instead, it makes an assumption about the winner based on static distances, which is not accurate.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game rounds and consider the optimal moves at each step. Here’s a more appropriate approach:

1. **Simulate Moves**: Simulate the moves of Ron and Hermione for each round.
2. **Check Valid Moves**: For each player, check if there are valid moves available.
3. **Determine Winner**: Based on the sequence of moves, determine who cannot make a move and hence loses.

Here’s a more detailed outline of how you might implement this:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    
    # Function to perform BFS and get the path
    def bfs(start, target):
        queue = deque([(start, [])])
        visited = set([start])
        while queue:
            (current, path) = queue.popleft()
            if current == target:
                return path
            for neighbor in tree[current]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
        return []

    # Function to simulate the game
    def simulate_game(start):
        current_node = start
        moves = []
        while True:
            leaves = [node for node in tree[current_node] if len(tree[node]) == 1]
            if not leaves:
                break
            next_node = None
            for leaf in leaves:
                if leaf not in moves:
                    next_node = leaf
                    break
            if next_node is None:
                break
            moves.append(next_node)
            current_node = next_node
        return moves

    # Simulate the game for the given start node
    moves = simulate_game(start)
    # Determine the winner based on the sequence of moves
    if len(moves) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Hermione'
    else:
        return 'Ron'

# Example usage
n = 3
edges = [(2, 3), (3, 1)]
start = 3
print(func_1(n, edges, start))  # Output should be 'Ron'
```

This approach simulates the game rounds and determines the winner based on the sequence of moves, ensuring that the solution accounts for optimal play by both players.
