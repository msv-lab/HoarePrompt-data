Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree with specific rules. The game is played over multiple rounds, but the provided code only handles one round (`t=1`).
2. The code correctly constructs the tree and identifies the two leaves.
3. The `bfs` function is used to calculate the shortest distances from the starting node to each of the two leaves.
4. The logic in `func_1` checks if either of these distances is even. If so, it returns 'Ron', otherwise 'Hermione'. This logic aligns with the game rules where the player who cannot make a move loses, and the optimal strategy depends on the parity of the distances.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided code appears to be correct for the described scenario.

Correctness: **True**
