Output State: **`current` is the first element of `queue`; `dist` is the second element of `queue`; `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element.**

This means that the `popleft()` method has been called on the `queue`, which removes the first element from the queue and assigns its values to `current` and `dist`. The `queue` is now updated to contain the remaining elements.
