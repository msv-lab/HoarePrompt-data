Output State: All nodes in the tree have been processed, and the variable `dist` contains the shortest distance from the `start` node to each node in the tree. The `visited` set contains all nodes that were visited during the traversal, and the `queue` is empty since all nodes have been processed.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program has traversed the entire tree starting from the `start` node. For every node in the tree, the `dist` variable holds the shortest path distance from the `start` node to that node. The `visited` set includes every node that was visited during the traversal, ensuring no node was processed more than once. Finally, the `queue` is empty because there are no more nodes to process, indicating that the entire tree has been explored.
