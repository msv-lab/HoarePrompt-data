Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `neighbor` and `current`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each neighbor of the current node in the tree.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, and `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element.
   - `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`.
   - Either `neighbor` has been added to `visited` and `queue` now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, or `neighbor` is not in `visited` and remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `current` will change to the next node in the queue.
   - `dist` will be updated to `dist + 1` for the next node.
   - `queue` will be updated to include the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `current` will be the next node in the queue, which means it will be the first element of the updated `queue`.
- `dist` will be the second element of the updated `queue` plus 1.
- `queue` will be the remaining elements of the updated `queue` after removing the first element.
- `tree` must still have at least one neighbor for the new `current`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue` plus 1, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`**.
