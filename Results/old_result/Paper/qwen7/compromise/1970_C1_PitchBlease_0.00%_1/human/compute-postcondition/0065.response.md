Output State: **`current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`, and `neighbor` has been added to `visited`; `queue` now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the distance to the `neighbor` from the `current` node is updated to `dist + 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
