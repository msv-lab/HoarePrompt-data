Output State: **`dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, and `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` now includes the `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the distance from the start to the neighbor is updated to be the distance from the start to the current node plus 1. Additionally, the `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
