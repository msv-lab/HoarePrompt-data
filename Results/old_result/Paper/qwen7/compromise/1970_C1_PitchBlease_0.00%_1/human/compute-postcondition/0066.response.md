Postcondition: `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`, and either `neighbor` has been added to `visited` with `queue` now including a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, or there is no else part as `neighbor` is already in `visited`.
