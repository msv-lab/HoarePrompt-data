The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-empty (i.e., `t` must be truthy).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is reduced to the first element of the input split by spaces.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of \(n\) non-negative integers in strictly increasing order.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- The function `r` is defined as a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.

Since `t` is set to the first element of the input split by spaces, for the loop to execute the first time, `t` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is non-empty.

State: **`t` must be non-empty**
