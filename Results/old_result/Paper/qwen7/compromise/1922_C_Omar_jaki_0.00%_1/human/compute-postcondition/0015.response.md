Output State: **`t` is a non-empty value decreased by 1, `r()` has been called, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `b` is `[0, 0, v, v + v], v is y - x`**

Explanation: The code `v = y - x` assigns the value of `y - x` to the variable `v`. The values of `t`, `r()`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
