Output State: **`t` is reduced to the first element of the input split by spaces, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and the function `r` is defined as a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.**

The code `t, = r()` takes the input split by spaces and assigns the first element to `t`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
