Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements where the first element is -1000000000.0, the second element is the result of the function `r()`, the third element is 2000000000.0, the fourth and subsequent elements are unchanged from the initial state, `b` is a list with two elements both set to 0, `u` is `False`, `c` and `d` are the results of the function `r()` after the loop has executed all its iterations, and `t` is now `t - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements where the first element is -1000000000.0, the second element is the result of the function `r()`, the third element is 2000000000.0, and the fourth and subsequent elements are unchanged from the initial state, `b` is a list with two elements where the first element is `b[0] + v

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements where the first element is `r()`, the second element is `2000000000.0`, the third element is unchanged from the initial state, and the fourth and subsequent elements are unchanged from the initial state, `b` is a list with two elements where the first element is `b[0] + v + v

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements starting from the fifth element of its initial state, `v` is `y - x`, the first element of `b` is `b[0] + v + v` from the previous iteration, `b` now includes the second last element updated to `b[-2] + v




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
