Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   The loop head is defined as:
   ```python
   for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
   ```
   The variables involved in the loop head are:
   - `w`
   - `x`
   - `y`
   - `z`

2. **Determine the initial conditions:**
   - `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `a` is a list with at least 4 elements.
   - The first element of `a` is -1000000000.0.
   - The second, third, and fourth elements of `a` are any values.
   - `b` is `[0, 2 * v]`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over tuples `(w, x, y, z)` where each tuple is formed from consecutive elements of the list `a`.
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least four elements left in `a` to form the next tuple.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over four elements at a time, after one iteration, the first four elements of `a` are consumed.
   - Therefore, `a` must now have at least one element remaining for the next iteration.
   - The first element of `a` remains -1000000000.0.
   - The second, third, and fourth elements of `a` are any values, but they will shift one position to the left for the next iteration.
   - `w` will be the new first element of `a` (which is -1000000000.0).
   - `x` will be the new second element of `a`.
   - `y` will be the new third element of `a`.
   - `z` will be the new fourth element of `a`.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `total` remains greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `a` must now have at least one element remaining, so it has at least 3 elements left.
   - The first element of `a` is still -1000000000.0.
   - The second element of `a` is any value.
   - The third element of `a` is any value.
   - The fourth element of `a` is any value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second element of `a` is any value, the third element of `a` is any value, the fourth element of `a` is any value**
