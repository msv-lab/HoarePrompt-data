Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and the function `r` is defined as a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, and converts them to integers. However, it does not execute this function or modify any existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the definition of the lambda function `r` is added to the state.
