The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it generates a random permutation of the string `s` and checks if the original string is different from the permutation. If they are different, it prints 'Yes' followed by the random permutation; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
