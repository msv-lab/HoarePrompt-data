Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, where for each test case, either 'Yes' followed by a randomly permuted version of the input string `s`, or 'No' will be printed. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases provided as input. Each line either confirms that the string was not a palindrome (by printing 'Yes' and a random permutation) or denies it (by printing 'No').
