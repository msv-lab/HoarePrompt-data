Correctness: **True**

The provided program is designed to solve the problem correctly. Here's why:

1. The program takes an integer `t` as input, which indicates the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it generates a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of the input string `s`.
3. It then checks if `s` is different from `s2`. If they are different, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string `s2`. Otherwise, it prints "No".
4. The use of `random.sample(s, len(s))` ensures that all characters in the new string `s2` are from the original string `s`, but the order is randomized.
5. Since the problem allows for any valid rearrangement if one exists, and the program provides a valid rearrangement when possible, the solution is correct.

The program handles all the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.
