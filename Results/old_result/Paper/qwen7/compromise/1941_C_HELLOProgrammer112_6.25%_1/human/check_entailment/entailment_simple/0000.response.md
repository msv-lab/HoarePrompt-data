Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s` and prints their sum. However, the goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, meaning it should not contain either "map" or "pie".

The program's logic fails because:
1. It does not remove any characters; it only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie".
2. It does not consider the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

Given the example inputs and outputs, the program would incorrectly output the sum of counts of "map" and "pie" instead of the minimum number of deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
