Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum. This approach does not ensure that the minimum number of deletions are made.

For example, consider the input string "mmapnapie". The program would count 2 occurrences of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a total of 3 deletions. However, the optimal solution is to delete only 2 characters (the 4th and 9th characters), which makes the string "mnapie".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
