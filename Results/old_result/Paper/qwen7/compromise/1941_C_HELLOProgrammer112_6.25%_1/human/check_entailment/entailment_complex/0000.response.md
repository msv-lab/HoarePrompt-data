Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints the sum of these counts. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful, not the total count of "map" and "pie".

The program should instead iterate through the string and remove characters to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings, keeping track of the minimum deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
