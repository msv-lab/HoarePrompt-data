Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `t`, a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and calculates the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`. It then prints this total count for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.**
