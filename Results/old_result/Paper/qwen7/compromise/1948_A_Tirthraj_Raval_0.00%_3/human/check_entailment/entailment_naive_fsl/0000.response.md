Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as required. For example, consider `n = 6`. The program generates a string like "ABABAB", which has 4 special characters (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5), not 6. The pattern used in the program does not ensure that exactly `n` characters are special. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement for certain values of `n`.
