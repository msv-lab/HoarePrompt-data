Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `i` is 3, `pattern` contains 'A', 'B', and 'AB'[3 % 2], `n` must be greater than 6**.

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2]` to the `pattern` list. Given that `i` is 3, `i % 2` evaluates to 1 (since 3 % 2 = 1), so `'AB'[1]` is appended, which is 'B'. Therefore, the updated `pattern` now contains 'A', 'B', and 'B'. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
