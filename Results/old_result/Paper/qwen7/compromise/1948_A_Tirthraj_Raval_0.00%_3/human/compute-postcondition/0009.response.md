Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration.
   - `n` is an input integer and is even, and it must be greater than 0 as per the provided state.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n // 2` must be at least 1).
   - `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n // 2 - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be at least 2 to ensure that `range(n // 2)` produces at least one element.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 2 (since `n` is even and must be greater than 0).

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `pattern` is an empty list**.
