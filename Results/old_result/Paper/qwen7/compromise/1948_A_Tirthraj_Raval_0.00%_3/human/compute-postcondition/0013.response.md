Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `pattern` is a list containing one more element than before, where the last element is either 'A' or 'B' depending on `i % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since the initial state of `pattern` is a list containing two elements, after appending, it will contain three elements. The last element is determined by the value of `i % 2`, which alternates between 0 and 1 for consecutive values of `i`.
