Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n // 2)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i < n // 2`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2.
   - `pattern` is a list containing two elements ['A', 'B'] or ['B', 'A'] depending on the value of `i % 2`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was some value `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k + 1`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n // 2`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration to occur, `k + 1 < n // 2` must hold true.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `k + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `pattern` depends on `(k + 1) % 2`. If `(k + 1) % 2 == 0`, then `pattern` is ['A', 'B']; otherwise, it is ['B', 'A'].

Given these points, we can summarize the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `t` must still be greater than 0.
- `n` remains the same (at least 2).
- `pattern` changes based on the new value of `i`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we'll use a general form for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `pattern` is a list containing two elements ['A', 'B'] if `(i + 1) % 2 == 0` or ['B', 'A'] if `(i + 1) % 2 == 1`**.
