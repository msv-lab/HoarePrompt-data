State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The variable `n` is used within the loop but its value is not directly affecting the loop's condition. However, since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, this constraint must still hold true for each iteration of the loop, but it doesn't affect the loop's execution condition itself.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.

So, the state to be adjusted is:
- **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50**
