Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` being 0 (since `range(n // 2)` generates values from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`).
   - The value of `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute because if `n` is 0 or negative, the range would be empty.

3. **Adjust the Given States**:
   - The initial state of `t` is given as `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1. This information about `t` is not directly relevant to the loop execution and does not need to be adjusted.
   - The state of `n` must be such that it allows the loop to execute, i.e., `n` must be at least 1.
   - The state of `pattern` is irrelevant to the loop execution and does not need to be adjusted.

4. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
**`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**.
