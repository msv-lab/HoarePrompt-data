Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `pattern` is a list containing one more element than before, where the last element is 'B'**.

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]` to the `pattern` list. Given that `i % 2 ^ 1` evaluates to `1` when `i % 2` is `0` (because `0 ^ 1` is `1`) and to `0` when `i % 2` is `1` (because `1 ^ 1` is `0`), the last element added to `pattern` is `'B'`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
