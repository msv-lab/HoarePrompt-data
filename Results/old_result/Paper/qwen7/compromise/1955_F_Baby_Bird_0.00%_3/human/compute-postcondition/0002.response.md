Output State: The output state is a series of integers resulting from the evaluation of the given loop for each test case. For each test case, the output is calculated based on the following logic:

1. Read four integers \( p_i \) (representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s).
2. Transform each \( p_i \) to its nearest even number.
3. Check if the first three transformed numbers (1s, 2s, 3s) are all odd.
4. If the condition in step 3 is true, add 1 to the result; otherwise, add 0.
5. Add half of the sum of all transformed numbers (integer division).

The final output state is a list of these results for each test case.
