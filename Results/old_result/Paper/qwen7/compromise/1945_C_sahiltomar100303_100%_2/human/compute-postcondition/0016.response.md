Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments `tleftZero` by 1. Initially, `tleftZero` is 0, so after the increment, `tleftZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `leftZero` is 1 means that after the increment, `leftZero` becomes 2 (since `tleftZero` is added to `leftZero`).
