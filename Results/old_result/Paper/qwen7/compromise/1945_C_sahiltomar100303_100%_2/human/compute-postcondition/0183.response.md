Postcondition: `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftZero`, `left`, `leftMove`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, `right`, `mid`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `i` remain unchanged, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 when `s[i]` is '0', and `leftZero` is incremented by 1 while `leftOne` is reset to 0 when `s[i]` is not '0'.
