Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and equals `left - 1`, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since the initial condition was that `left` must be greater than 0 and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', after executing `leftZero -= 1`, `left` now equals `left - 1`. The character at the new index `left - 1` remains '0' as no changes were made to the string `s`.
