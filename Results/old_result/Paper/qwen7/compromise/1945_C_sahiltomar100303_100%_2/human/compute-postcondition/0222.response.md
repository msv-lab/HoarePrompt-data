Output State: `rightOne` is between 0 and `n`, `rightZero` is between 0 and `n`, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is between 0 and `n`, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n`, `trightOne` is between 0 and `n`, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n`, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` will each have a value between 0 and `n` inclusive, because the loop iterates from `mid` to `n-1`, and in each iteration, it increments either `rightZero` or `rightOne` based on the value of `s[i]`. The values of `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, `right`, `mid`, and `tleftZero` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop runs from `mid` to `n-1`, which means it runs `n - mid` times, effectively covering all elements of the string `s` from the midpoint to the end. Therefore, the counts of zeros and ones in the right half of the string will be reflected in `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne`.
