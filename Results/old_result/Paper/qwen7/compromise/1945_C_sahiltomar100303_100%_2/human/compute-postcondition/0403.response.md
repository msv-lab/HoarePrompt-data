Postcondition: **`leftZero` is reduced by 1 if the character at `s[left - 1]` is '0'. Otherwise, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1` plus 1, `left` is `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`.**
