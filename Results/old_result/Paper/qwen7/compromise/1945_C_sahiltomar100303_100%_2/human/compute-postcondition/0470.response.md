Based on the initial state provided:

- `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `n + 1` + 1.
- `leftMove` remains 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `0`.
- `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `0`.
- `left` is now 0.
- `mid` is 0.
- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered from `mid` to `0`.
- `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[0]` is '0'.
- `trightOne` is `trightOne - 1` if `s[0]` is '1'.
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - right + 1`.
- `left` is not equal to 0.

The print statement is `print(left)`. According to the initial state, `left` is explicitly stated to be 0.

Output: **0**
