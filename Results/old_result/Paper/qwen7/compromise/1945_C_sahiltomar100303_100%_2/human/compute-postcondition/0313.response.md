Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`. If the current value of `left` is not 0, the postcondition remains unchanged. If the value of `left` is 0, the postcondition also remains unchanged regardless of the relationship between `tleftZero` and `(n + 1) // 2`.
