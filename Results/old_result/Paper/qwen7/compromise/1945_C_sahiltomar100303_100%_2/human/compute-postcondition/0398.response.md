Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1` plus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - mid + 1`, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightZero` by 1, so `rightZero` now includes one more zero from the range `[mid, n-1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
