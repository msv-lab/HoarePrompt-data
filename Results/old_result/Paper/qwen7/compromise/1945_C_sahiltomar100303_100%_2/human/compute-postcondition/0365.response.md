Output State: `i` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is either `tleftZero` minus `mid` if `s[mid]` is '0', or `tleftZero` minus `mid` minus 1 if `s[mid]` is '1', `leftOne` is either `tleftOne` minus `mid` if `s[mid]` is '1', or `tleftOne` minus `mid` minus 1 if `s[mid]` is '0', `tleftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered up to the middle index, `tleftOne` is the total number of ones encountered up to the middle index.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `mid`, which is `n // 2`. The values of `leftZero` and `leftOne` will depend on the number of zeros and ones encountered from the start of the string up to the middle index. `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` will reflect the cumulative count of zeros and ones respectively from the start of the string up to the middle index.
