Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and equal to `left - 1`, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `left` was initially greater than 0 and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` was not '0', after decrementing `leftOne` by 1, `left` becomes `left - 1`. All other conditions remain the same.
