Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1, `rightOne` remains unchanged.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `rightZero` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', and the character at index `i` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented. The value of `rightOne` remains unchanged as no operation affects it.
