Based on the initial state provided:

- `rightZero` is 0
- `leftZero` is 0
- `left` is 0
- `leftMove` remains 0
- `trightZero` is 0
- `tleftOne` is 8
- `trightOne` is 0
- `leftOne` is 2
- `right` is `n`

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of the variable `right`.

From the initial state, it is explicitly stated that `right` is equal to `n`.

Output: **n**
