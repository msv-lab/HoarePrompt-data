Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is the integer input of the user, `s` is the string input of the user, `mid` is the floor division of `n` by 2, `leftZero` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightZero`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
