Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mid` to `n-1`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within `s` such that `i + 1 < n`.
   - If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `i + 1 < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged unless the character at the new `i` is '0' or '1', but since no new information about these counters is given, they stay the same.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` must now be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain the same.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1.** 

However, since `i` is incremented by 1, the precise new state for `i` is:

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1.** 

To explicitly state the updated value of `i`:

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1.** 

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the precise new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

Final State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
