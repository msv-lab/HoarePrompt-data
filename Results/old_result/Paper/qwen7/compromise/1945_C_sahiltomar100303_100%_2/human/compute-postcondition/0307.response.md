Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.
- The value of `left` is 0.
- The current value of `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of the variable `right`, which is equal to `n`.

Output: **n**
