Output State: `rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is between 0 and n (inclusive).

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` will each have a value between 0 and `n` inclusive, because the loop iterates from `0` to `mid - 1` (which is `n // 2 - 1`), and in each iteration, it increments either `leftZero` or `leftOne` based on the value of `s[i]`. The values of `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, `right`, `mid`, and `tleftZero` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
