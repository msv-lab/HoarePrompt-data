Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + (n - mid - 1)`, `rightZero` will be equal to the number of zeros in the substring from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` will be equal to the number of ones in the same substring.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will point to the last index of the string `s`, `n` will still be the length of the string, and the counts of zeros (`rightZero`) and ones (`rightOne`) in the substring from index `mid` to `n-1` will be accurately reflected in these variables.
