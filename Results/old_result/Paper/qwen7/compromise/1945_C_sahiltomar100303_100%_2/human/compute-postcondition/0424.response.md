Postcondition: `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1`, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is now `0` (since `left` starts from `mid` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), `mid` is 0 (as `left` reaches 0, indicating the loop has ended), `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, `right` is set to `mid`, `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` must be 0, `trightOne` must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
