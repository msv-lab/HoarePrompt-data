State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `i` is 0, `mid` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, `i` must be set to 0.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < mid`. Therefore, `mid` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `mid` to be greater than 0.
