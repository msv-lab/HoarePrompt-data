Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is either 1, 2, or 3, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is either 0 or 1, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is either 0 or 2, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 4 or 2, `mid` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially either 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing, it can now be 1, 2, or 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
