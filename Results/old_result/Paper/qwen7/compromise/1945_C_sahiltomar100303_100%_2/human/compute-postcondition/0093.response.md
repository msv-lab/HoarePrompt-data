Output State: **`rightZero` is 4, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is 3, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid`**.

Explanation: The code `right = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `rightZero`, `leftZero`, `left`, `leftMove`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. The new state includes the updated value of `right` being set to `mid`.
