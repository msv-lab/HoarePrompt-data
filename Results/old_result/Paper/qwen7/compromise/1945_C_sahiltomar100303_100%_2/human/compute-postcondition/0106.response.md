Output State: **`rightZero` is 4, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 2, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is 2, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid`, `n` must be less than or equal to 9, `tleftZero` is increased by 1.**

The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Initially, `tleftZero` is 2, so after the increment, `tleftZero` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
