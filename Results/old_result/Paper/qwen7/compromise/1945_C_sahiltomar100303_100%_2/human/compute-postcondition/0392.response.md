Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` will be equal to the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` will be equal to the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`; `left` is set to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `left` to `mid`. The values of `i`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from their previous states after executing the line of code. Therefore, `left` is now `mid`, while `i` is `n-1`, and the counts of `rightZero` and `rightOne` reflect the number of zeros and ones from index `mid` to `n-1`.
