Based on the initial state provided:

- `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `n + 1` + 1.
- `leftMove` remains 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `0`.
- `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `0`.
- `left` is now `0`.
- `mid` is `0`.
- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered from `mid` to `0`.
- `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[0]` is '0'.
- `trightOne` is `trightOne - 1` if `s[0]` is '1'.
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - right + 1`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the relevant parts for the `print(left)` statement:

1. `left` is explicitly stated to be `0`.
2. No other operations or assignments are performed on `left` after it is set to `0`.

Therefore, when the `print(left)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `left`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
