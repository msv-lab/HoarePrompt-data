Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `mid - 1`, `leftZero` will be either `tleftZero` or `tleftZero - 1`, `leftOne` will be either `tleftOne` or `tleftOne - 1`, and both `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` will be equal to `mid`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `mid - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `mid - 1`. The values of `leftZero` and `leftOne` will depend on how many zeros and ones were encountered in the string `s` up to index `mid - 1`. Specifically, `leftZero` will be one less than `tleftZero` if the last character processed was a '1', and `leftOne` will be one less than `tleftOne` if the last character processed was a '0'. Both `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` will be equal to `mid` because they accumulate the counts of zeros and ones as the loop progresses through the first half of the string `s`.
