Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is the integer input of the user, `s` is the string input of the user, `mid` is the floor division of `n` by 2, `leftOne` is 0.**

The code initializes `leftOne` to 0, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of all variables except `leftOne`, which is now explicitly set to 0.
