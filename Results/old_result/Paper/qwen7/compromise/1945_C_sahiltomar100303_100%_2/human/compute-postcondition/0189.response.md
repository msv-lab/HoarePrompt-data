Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 1 (since it was 0 and was incremented by 1), `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `mid` must be greater than 0.**

The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
