Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is 0, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and `right` is set to `mid`, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1`, the current value of `s[right]` is '0'**.

Explanation: The line `trightZero -= 1` decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was initially equal to `rightZero`, after decrementing, `trightZero` becomes `rightZero - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
