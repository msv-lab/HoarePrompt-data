Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced by 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 1 - 1`, `mid` must be greater than 2, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and `leftOne` is reduced by 1, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the updated condition for `rightOne` is that it is now less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, plus it has been incremented by 1.
