Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0; `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2; `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2; `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from the initial state.
