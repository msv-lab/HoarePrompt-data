Output State: **`rightOne` is 1, `rightZero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is either 0 or 1, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `n // 2 + 2**.

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Since `rightOne` was either 0, 1, 2, or 3 initially, after incrementing, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
