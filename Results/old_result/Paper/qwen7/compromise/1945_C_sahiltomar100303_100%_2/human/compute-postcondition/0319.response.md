To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `right` is not equal to `n`.
   - `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.

2. **Condition:**
   - The current value of `right` satisfies the condition that the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`.

From the condition, we know that `left` is the value that minimizes the absolute difference with `(n + 1) // 2`. Given that `right` must satisfy this condition, it implies that `left` is the value that makes the absolute difference minimal.

Given the definitions of `tleftZero` and `trightOne`, we can infer that:
- `tleftZero` is the midpoint of `n` rounded up.
- `trightOne` is the midpoint of `n` rounded down.

Since `right` must satisfy the condition relative to `left`, and considering the nature of the problem, `left` should be equal to `tleftZero` because it is the value that minimizes the absolute difference with `(n + 1) // 2`.

Therefore, the value of `left` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output: **(n + 1) // 2**
