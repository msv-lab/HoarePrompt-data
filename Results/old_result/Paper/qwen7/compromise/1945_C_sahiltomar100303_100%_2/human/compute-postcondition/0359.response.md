Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is 1**

The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Given that `leftZero` was initially 0 (implied from the initial state where `i` is 2 and `mid` must be greater than 0), after executing the code, `leftZero` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
