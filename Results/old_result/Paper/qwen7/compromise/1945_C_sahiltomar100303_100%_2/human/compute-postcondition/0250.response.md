Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is either (`leftZero` - 1) if `s[left - 1]` was '0', or remains less than (left + 1) // 2 if `s[left - 1]` was not '0'. `rightOne` is either unchanged or increased by 1 depending on the condition, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` was not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1.
