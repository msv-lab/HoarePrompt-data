Output State: **If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 3, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` remains 2, `left` is now `left - 1` (greater than 3), and `leftMove` remains 0. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', then `rightZero` remains 3, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` is now 5, `trightOne` is now 3, `left` is now `left - 1` (greater than 3), and `leftMove` remains 0.**

This output state reflects the decrement of the `left` variable by 1, and updates the conditions based on the value of `s[left - 1]`.
