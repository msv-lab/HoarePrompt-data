Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is either 0 or 1, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is either 1 or 3, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 4 or 2, `mid` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1. Since `leftOne` could initially be either 0 or 2, after incrementing it by 1, `leftOne` becomes either 1 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
