Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 0, `leftOne` is 4, `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 3**

Explanation: The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Since `tleftOne` was initially equal to `leftOne`, which is 3, after executing the code, `tleftOne` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `mid` is still greater than 0, `leftOne` remains 3 but is updated to 4, and the conditions for `leftZero` and `tleftZero` remain the same.
