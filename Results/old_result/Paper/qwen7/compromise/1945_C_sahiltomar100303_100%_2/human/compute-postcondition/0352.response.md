Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is 3, `tleftZero` is 3**

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is initially 2 and `tleftZero` is 3. After incrementing `leftZero`, its new value becomes 3. The other variables (`i`, `mid`) remain unchanged.
