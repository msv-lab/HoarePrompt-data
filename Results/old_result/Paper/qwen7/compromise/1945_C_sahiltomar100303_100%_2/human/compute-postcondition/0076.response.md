Output State: **`rightZero` is 2, `leftZero` is now `left - 2`, `left` is now `left - 1`, `leftMove` remains 0, and both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1, so its new value is 3 - 1 = 2. The variable `left` is updated to `left - 1`, making it `left - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
