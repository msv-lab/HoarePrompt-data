Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state. The condition for `rightZero` and `rightOne` mentioned in the initial state does not affect the outcome of the increment operation.
