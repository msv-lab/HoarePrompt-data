Output State: **`rightZero` is unchanged, `trightZero` is unchanged, `tleftOne` is unchanged, `trightOne` is unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `leftZero` is `leftZero` + 1, `tleftZero` is `tleftZero` + 1**.

The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
