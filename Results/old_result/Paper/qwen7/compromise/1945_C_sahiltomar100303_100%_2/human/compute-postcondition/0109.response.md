Output State: **`trightOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 4, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 2, `tleftOne` is 7, `trightOne` is 1, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid`, `n` must be less than or equal to 9, and `s[right]` is either '0' or not '0'.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. Initially, `trightOne` was 2. After decrementing, its value becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
