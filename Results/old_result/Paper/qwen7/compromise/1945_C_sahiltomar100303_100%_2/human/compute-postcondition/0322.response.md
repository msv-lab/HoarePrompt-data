Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.
- The condition `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is true.

We need to determine what `right` is and confirm it meets the condition given. Since `right` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`, and the condition involves `right`, let's analyze it further.

Given the condition `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`, we know that `right` is `n`. For this condition to hold true, `left` must be closer to `tleftZero` than `right` is to `tleftZero`.

Since `tleftZero` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `right` is `n`, we can infer that `left` must be less than `tleftZero` because if `left` were greater than or equal to `tleftZero`, the condition would not hold true since `right` is `n` and `n` is farther from `tleftZero` than any value greater than or equal to `tleftZero`.

Therefore, the value of `right` is `n`.

Output: **n**
