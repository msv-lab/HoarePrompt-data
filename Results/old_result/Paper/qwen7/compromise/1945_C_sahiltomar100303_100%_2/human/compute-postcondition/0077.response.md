Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `leftZero` is now `left - 2`, `left` is now `left - 1`, `leftMove` remains 0, and both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `leftZero`, `left`, `leftMove`, and the conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
