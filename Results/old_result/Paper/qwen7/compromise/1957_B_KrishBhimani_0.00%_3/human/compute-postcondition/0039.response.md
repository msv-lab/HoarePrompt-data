Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 3, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list with three elements where the first element is `k0 - (k0 - sum(ans) + 1)`, the second element is 1, and the third element is `k0 - sum(ans)`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` has two elements: `k0 - sum(ans)` and 1. After appending, `ans` becomes a list with three elements. The first element is updated to `k0 - (k0 - sum(ans) + 1)`, which simplifies to `sum(ans) - 1`. The second element remains 1, and the third element is the newly appended value `k0 - sum(ans)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
