Postcondition: `arr` is [0, 1, 3], `i` is 3, `c` is the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is a non-zero odd number divided by 2 using bitwise right shift, `k0` is equal to `k` and must be even, and `k` is now `k >> 1. This holds true regardless of whether the condition `k & 1 == 1` is met or not, as there is no else part to alter these variables.
