Output State: **`arr` is [0], `i` is 1, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` (the second element of `l1`) is a non-zero integer, and `k` is odd.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `arr`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
