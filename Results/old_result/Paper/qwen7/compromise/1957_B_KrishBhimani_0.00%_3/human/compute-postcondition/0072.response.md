Postcondition: `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 2, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is a non-zero odd number divided by 2 (using bitwise right shift), `k0` is equal to `k`.

This postcondition states that after the execution of the if-else block, the array `arr` will contain the first two elements [0, 1], the index `i` will be 2, the value of `c` will be the new input value plus 2, the list `ans` will be extended by zeros to match the new length `n`, `n` will be the integer obtained from the last element of `l1`, `k` will be a non-zero odd number divided by 2 using bitwise right shift, and `k0` will be equal to `k`.
