Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the first and second elements of the list `l1` and converts them to integers, assigning `n` to the first element and `k` to the second element. The values of `arr`, `i`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
