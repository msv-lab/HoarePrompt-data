Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` (the second element of `l1`) is a non-zero integer, `k` is now `k >> 1`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` shifts the binary representation of `k` to the right by one bit, effectively dividing `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
