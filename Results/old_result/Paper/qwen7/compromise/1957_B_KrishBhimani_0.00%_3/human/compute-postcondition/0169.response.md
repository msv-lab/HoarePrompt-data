Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a value based on the conditions provided, where `n` is between 1 and 2⋅10^5, and `k` is between 1 and 10^9, with the constraint that the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
