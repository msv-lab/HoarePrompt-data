Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 4, `c` is equal to `n` + 1, `ans` is a list with four elements where the first three elements are 1, 1, and `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the fourth element is `2^4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 4, `1 << i` equals `1 << 4` which is 16. So, the fourth element of `ans` is 16. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
