Output State: **`k` is `k` right-shifted by 1 and the result is non-zero; if the least significant bit of the right-shifted `k` is 1, then `arr` is a list containing the integer `i+1`; otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged; `i` is `i` plus 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition for `arr` remains the same unless the least significant bit of the right-shifted `k` is 1, in which case `arr` will contain the new value of `i`. The right-shift operation on `k` and the check for the least significant bit remain unchanged.
