Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `c` is equal to `n`.
   - `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `k0 - sum(ans)` and the second element is 1.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in arr:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - Since `i` is an iterator variable, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `arr` must contain at least one element. This condition is already satisfied as stated in the initial state.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it needs to be adjusted to 3 for the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`arr`, `c`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State:**
   - `arr` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `c` is equal to `n`.
   - `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `k0 - sum(ans)` and the second element is 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 3, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `k0 - sum(ans)` and the second element is 1**
