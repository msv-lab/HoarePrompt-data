Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from splitting the second last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the last element of `l1` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `n`. It then takes the second last element of `l1` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
