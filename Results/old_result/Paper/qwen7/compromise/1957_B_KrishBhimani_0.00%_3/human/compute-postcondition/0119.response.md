Postcondition: `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` (the second element of `l1`) is a non-zero integer. If `k` is odd, `arr` becomes [0], `i` becomes 1.
