Output State: **`k` is `k` right-shifted by 1 and the result must be non-zero; `arr` is a list containing the integer `i`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the integer `i` to the list `arr`. The initial state of `k` being `k` right-shifted by 1 and the result being non-zero remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new list `arr` with the appended value `i`.
