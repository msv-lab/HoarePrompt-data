Output State: **`arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 2, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is a non-zero odd number divided by 2 (using bitwise right shift), `k0` is equal to `k`**

Explanation:
- `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. So, `arr` changes from `[0]` to `[0, 1]`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The value of `c` remains unchanged as it depends on the new input value which is not provided, but it is stated that `c` is equal to the new input value + 2.
- The values of `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `k0` remain unchanged as no operations affecting these variables are performed in the given code snippet.
