Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n` + 2, `ans` is a list with as many elements as there were iterations of the loop, starting with 1, 1, 2, 16, and continuing with each subsequent element being 2 raised to the power of the corresponding index in `arr`, and the final element is `2^i`; `ans` is extended by `0` for each missing element to match the length of `n`.**

Explanation:
- The line `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends `0` to the list `ans` for each missing element to make its length equal to `n`.
- Since `ans` initially contains the values 1, 1, 2, 16, and then continues with each element being `2^i` for each index `i` in `arr`, and the final element is `2^i`, appending `0`s will extend the list to match the length of `n`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `c`, and `ans` remain as described in the initial state, with `ans` now having the correct length.
