Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `k` is now equal to `k0` divided by 2, `arr` is a list containing the integer `0`, `i` is 1.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is set to 0. After executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
