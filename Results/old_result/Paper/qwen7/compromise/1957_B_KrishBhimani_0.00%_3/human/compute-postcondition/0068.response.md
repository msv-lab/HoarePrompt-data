Output State: **`arr` is [0], `i` is 1, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is a non-zero odd number divided by 2 (using bitwise right shift), `k0` is equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. The values of `arr`, `c`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `k0` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
