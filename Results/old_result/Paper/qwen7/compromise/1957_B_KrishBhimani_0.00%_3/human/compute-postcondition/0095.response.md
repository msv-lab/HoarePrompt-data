Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` contains a new element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply exits the context it was in, which could be a loop or an if-else statement. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
