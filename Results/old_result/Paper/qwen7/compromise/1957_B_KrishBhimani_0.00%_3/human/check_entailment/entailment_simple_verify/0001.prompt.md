You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations will be a list `ans` of length `n`. The list `arr` will contain indices where `k` had its least significant bit set to 1 during the loop. The variable `c` will be equal to `n` plus the number of bits set in `k`. The list `ans` will start with values derived from powers of 2 based on the indices in `arr`, and will be extended by zeros to match the length of `n`. Specifically, `ans` will contain values calculated as follows:
    #
    #- For each index `i` in `arr`, `ans` will include `1 << i`.
    #- If `c` equals `n - 1`, the remaining elements of `ans` will be filled with the value `k0 - sum(ans)`, followed by zeros to reach the length `n`.
    #
    #Given the example provided, if the loop runs multiple times and the final state of `arr` contains the indices where `k` had its bits set, and if `c` is calculated correctly, the final `ans` will be constructed according to the described rules. Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are not specified, the final `ans` will depend on these inputs, but it will follow the pattern described above.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR:**
   - The program constructs a sequence of numbers such that their bitwise OR results in a value with the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - It achieves this by setting certain bits in the numbers to 1, based on the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The program iterates through the bits of `k` using a loop.
   - If the current bit is 1 (`k & 1 == 1`), it appends the index of that bit to the `arr` list.
   - This means that the positions of the set bits in `k` will be used to create the sequence.

4. **Generating the Output Sequence:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final sequence.
   - It uses the indices from `arr` to generate numbers by shifting 1 left by the index value (`1 << i`).
   - These numbers are added to `ans`.
   - If the length of `ans` is less than `n`, it fills the remaining positions with 0s to make the total length `n`.

5. **Ensuring the Sum:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of the generated sequence equals `k`.
   - It adjusts the last element to make sure the sum is correct.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `1 5`
- Binary representation of `5` is `101` (bits at positions 0, 2).
- The program generates `[1, 4]` (which corresponds to `1 << 0` and `1 << 2`).
- Adjusted to ensure the sum is 5: `[1, 4]` (sum is 5).

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `2 3`
- Binary representation of `3` is `11` (bits at positions 0, 1).
- The program generates `[1, 2]` (which corresponds to `1 << 0` and `1 << 1`).
- Sum is `1 + 2 = 3`.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `2 5`
- Binary representation of `5` is `101` (bits at positions 0, 2).
- The program generates `[1, 4]` (which corresponds to `1 << 0` and `1 << 2`).
- Adjusted to ensure the sum is 5: `[5, 0]` (sum is 5).

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `6 51`
- Binary representation of `51` is `110011` (bits at positions 0, 2, 5).
- The program generates `[1, 4, 32, 2, 0, 0]` (which corresponds to `1 << 0`, `1 << 2`, `1 << 5`, `1 << 1`, and two zeros).
- Adjusted to ensure the sum is 51: `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]` (sum is 51).

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs sequences that satisfy both conditions: the sum of the elements equals `k`, and the bitwise OR of the elements has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
