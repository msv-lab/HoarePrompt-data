Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a total length not exceeding 10^6. For each test case, it returns a result based on the value of `t` and the content of `s`.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here, only the parameters and expected input structure are outlined.
