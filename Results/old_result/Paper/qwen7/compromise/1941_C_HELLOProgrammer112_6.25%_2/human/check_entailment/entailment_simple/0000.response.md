Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. However, the goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, not to count the occurrences of these substrings.

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie":
- The program would count 2 occurrences of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a print statement of `3`.
- However, to make this string beautiful, we only need to remove 2 characters ('m' at index 0 and 'e' at index 8), which can be done by removing the first 'm' and the last 'e'. This results in the string "mapna", which is now beautiful.

The program fails to account for the actual removal of characters and only counts occurrences, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
