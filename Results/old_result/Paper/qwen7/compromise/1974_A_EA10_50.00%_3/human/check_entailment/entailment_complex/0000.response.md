Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of screens needed to place icons of different sizes (1x1 and 2x2) on a grid.
2. The provided code correctly processes each test case by reading the values of \(x\) and \(y\) (number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively).
3. The logic within the function:
   - First, it calculates \(z\) as \((y + 1) // 2\), which represents the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on the screens.
   - Then, it calculates \(m = 15 * z - y * 4\), which accounts for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and adjusts based on the remaining space.
   - If \(m < x\), it means there are not enough remaining spaces to fit all 1x1 icons, so it adds the necessary additional screens to accommodate the remaining icons.
4. The formula used to calculate the total number of screens (`z`) seems to correctly account for both the 2x2 and 1x1 icons, ensuring the minimum number of screens is used.
5. The code correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
