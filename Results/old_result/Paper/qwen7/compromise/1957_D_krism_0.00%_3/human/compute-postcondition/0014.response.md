Output State: **`pre` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is `[0, 0]`; `suf` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is `[0, 0]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `suf` as a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`. This does not affect the `pre` list, which remains unchanged.
