To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a list of elements.
   - `prefix` is a list where each element `prefix[i]` is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to the `i`-th index, starting with `0`.

2. **Operations**:
   - The `prefix` list is constructed by iterating over `arr` and computing the cumulative XOR.

Given this, let's assume `arr` is a specific list, say `[a, b, c, d]` for illustration purposes. The construction of `prefix` would be as follows:
- `prefix[0] = 0 ^ arr[0] = 0 ^ a = a`
- `prefix[1] = prefix[0] ^ arr[1] = a ^ b`
- `prefix[2] = prefix[1] ^ arr[2] = (a ^ b) ^ c`
- `prefix[3] = prefix[2] ^ arr[3] = ((a ^ b) ^ c) ^ d`

So, if `arr = [a, b, c, d]`, then `prefix` will be `[0, a, a ^ b, a ^ b ^ c, a ^ b ^ c ^ d]`.

Now, let's consider the `print` statement:
```python
print(arr, prefix)
```

This will print both `arr` and `prefix` as lists. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we will represent them symbolically.

**Output:**
Output: **[a, b, c, d], [0, a, a ^ b, a ^ b ^ c, a ^ b ^ c ^ d]**
