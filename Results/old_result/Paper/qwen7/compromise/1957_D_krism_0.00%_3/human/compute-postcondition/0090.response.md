Output State: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[0]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of bits set to 0 in the same range.

After the loop completes all 32 iterations, `i` will be 0 because the loop decrements `i` from 32 to 1. The loop also decrements `j` from 31 to 0, so `j` will be 0. The variable `cur` remains unchanged at the initial value of `prefix[0]`. For each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will contain the total number of 1s in the binary representation of `cur` (since it counts 1s from position `j` to 31, and after 32 iterations, this covers all bits), and `suf[j][0]` will contain the total number of 0s in the same range.
