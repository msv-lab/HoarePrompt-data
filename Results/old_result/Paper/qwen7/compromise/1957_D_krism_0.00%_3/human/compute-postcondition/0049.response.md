Output State: **`i` is 31, `j` is 0, `suf[0][1]` is 1, and `(cur >> j & 1)` is true**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `(cur >> j & 1)` is true, and assuming `cur` is such that `(cur >> 0 & 1)` is true (which means `cur` is odd), the value of `suf[0][1]` changes from its initial state to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
