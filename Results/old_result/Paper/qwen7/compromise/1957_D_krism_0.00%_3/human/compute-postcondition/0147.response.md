Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is 2, `pre[2][1]` is 1, `suf[0][1]` is -1, `suf[j][1]` is -1**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `suf[2][1]` is decremented by 1. Initially, `suf[2][1]` was 1, so after the operation, `suf[2][1]` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
