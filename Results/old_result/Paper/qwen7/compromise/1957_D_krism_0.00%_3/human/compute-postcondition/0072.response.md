Postcondition: `i` is 30, `j` is 31, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range, `j` must be 31, and the current value of `cur` when the if condition is met is such that the bit at position `j` (which is 31) in `cur` is set to 1.
