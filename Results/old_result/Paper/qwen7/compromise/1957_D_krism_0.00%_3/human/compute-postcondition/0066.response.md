Output State: `i` is 31, `j` is 31, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.

To understand this final state, consider that the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 31. For each `j`, it checks the `j`-th bit of `cur` (from the right, starting at 0). If the bit is 1, it increments `suf[j][1]`. If the bit is 0, it increments `suf[j][0]`. By the end of the loop, `suf[j][1]` will hold the number of 1s in the bits from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` will hold the number of 0s in the same range. This means that `suf[0][1]` will be the total number of 1s in the last 32 bits of `cur`, and `suf[0][0]` will be the total number of 0s in those bits.
