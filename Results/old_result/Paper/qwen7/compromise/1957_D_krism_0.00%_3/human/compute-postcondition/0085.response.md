Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` is the original count of bits set to 0 in the range from position `j` to 31 plus 1, and `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the same range.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the count of bits set to 0 (`suf[j][0]`) by 1 for each `j` from 0 to 31. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `suf[j][0]` for each `j` from 0 to 31 is now one more than its original value, while `suf[j][1]` remains the same as before.
