Postcondition: `i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31 plus 1 if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, otherwise `suf[j][1]` remains the original count of bits set to 1 in the same range. Similarly, `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the range from position `j` to 31 plus 1, regardless of the value of the bit at position `j` in `cur`.
