Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1):` will start from `n` and decrement `i` until `i` is no longer greater than or equal to 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from a value that is greater than or equal to 0. Since the loop decrements `i`, `i` should start from a value that allows for at least one iteration.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` is given as 32 initially.
   - The variable `n` is also given as 32 initially.
   - Both `i` and `n` need to be adjusted such that the loop can execute correctly. Specifically, `i` should be initialized to `n` and `n` should be greater than 0 to allow the loop to run.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 32, `n` must be greater than 0**
