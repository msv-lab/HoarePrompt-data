Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is 2, `pre[2][0]` is 1, `suf[0][1]` is -1 if `(c >> 1 & 1)` is true; otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is -1**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `pre[j][0]` which is `pre[2][0]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `pre[2][0]` is not specified, so we assume it to be 0 (since no other value is given). After the increment, `pre[2][0]` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
