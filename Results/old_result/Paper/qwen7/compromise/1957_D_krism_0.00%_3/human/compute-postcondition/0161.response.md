Output State: **`ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]`, `j` is 31, `c` is prefix[i], `pre[31][1]` is 33, and `suf[31][1]` is -32, `k` is 4, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, and the current value of `c` has its `j`-th bit set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 31, `pre[31][1]` is updated from 32 to 33. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
