Output State: **`ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]`, `j` is 30, `c` is prefix[i], `pre[31][1]` is 33, and `suf[31][1]` is -33, `k` is 4, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, and the current value of `c` has its `j`-th bit set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 31, the value of `suf[31][1]` changes from -32 to -33. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
