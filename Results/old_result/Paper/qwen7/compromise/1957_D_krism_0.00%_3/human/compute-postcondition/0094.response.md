Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[0]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of bits set to 0 in the same range, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 0. No changes are made to the values of `i`, `j`, `cur`, or `suf`. Therefore, the values remain as they were in the initial state.
