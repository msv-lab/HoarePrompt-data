Output State: **`ans` is increased by either `pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]` or `pre[4][0] * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]`, depending on whether the `j`-th bit of `c` is set to 1, `pre[4][1]` is increased by 1, `k` remains 4, `j` is 30, `c` is `prefix[i]`, and `y` is `arr[i - 1]`; `suf[31][1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` is 31, the value of `suf[31][1]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
