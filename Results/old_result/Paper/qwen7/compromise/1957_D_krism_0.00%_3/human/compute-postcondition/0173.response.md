Output State: **`ans` is increased by either `2 * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]` or `2 * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]`, depending on whether the 31st bit of `prefix[i]` is set to 1; `suf[4][0]` is decreased by 1; `pre[4][0]` is 2; `suf[4][1]` remains unchanged; `k` remains 4; `c` is `prefix[i]`; `y` is `arr[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[4][0]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `ans` based on the 31st bit of `prefix[i]` remains the same.
