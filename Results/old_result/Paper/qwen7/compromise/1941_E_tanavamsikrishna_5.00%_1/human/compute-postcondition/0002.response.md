Output State: **`costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original values; `rows` retains its original structure and values.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `costs` using a list comprehension. Each element in `costs` is the result of calling the function `func_1` with two arguments: `row` (each inner list from `rows`) and `d`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the structure of `rows` (a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` positive integers) also remains the same.
