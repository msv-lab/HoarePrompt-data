### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river to calculate the cost of placing supports under the given constraints.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1.
   - For each subsequent element, it calculates the cost as the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus 1.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the processed row, which represents the total cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire grid of the river to find the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of placing supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of the `k` rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges across consecutive rows.
   - The logic for calculating the cost and finding the minimum total cost is consistent with the problem statement.
