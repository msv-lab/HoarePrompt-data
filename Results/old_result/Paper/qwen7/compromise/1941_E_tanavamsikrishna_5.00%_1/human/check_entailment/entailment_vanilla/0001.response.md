Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function processes a single row of the river to calculate the cost of installing supports under the given constraints.

1. **Initial Setup**: The function starts by iterating from `0` to `d - 2` and increments the value of each element in this range by `1`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each element starting from `d - 1` to the end of the row, it calculates the minimum cost required to place a support at that position. This is done using the formula:
   ```python
   row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
   ```
   This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. If the current index `i` is less than `d`, the minimum cost is calculated considering only the first `i` elements.
3. **Return the Last Element**: Finally, the function returns the last element of the processed row, which represents the total cost for that row.

#### Function `func_2`
This function processes the entire input and calculates the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from the input, followed by the `n` rows of the river.
2. **Cost Calculation**: It applies the `func_1` function to each row to compute the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It iterates through the list of costs for each possible starting row of the `k` bridges and calculates the sum of costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
4. **Result Output**: It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.
