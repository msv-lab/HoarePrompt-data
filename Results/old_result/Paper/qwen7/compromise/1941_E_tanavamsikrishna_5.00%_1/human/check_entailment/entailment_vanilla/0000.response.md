Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river.
   - It ensures that the cost of installing supports in each cell is calculated correctly according to the problem constraints.
   - Specifically, it ensures that the cost of installing a support in each cell is at least the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells plus 1.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire problem.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the river grid into a list of lists called `rows`.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to calculate the minimum cost for each row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

### Detailed Verification

1. **`func_1` Function**:
   - The function correctly updates the cost of each cell in the row based on the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells plus 1.
   - The logic ensures that the cost of installing a support in each cell is minimized while adhering to the constraints.

2. **`func_2` Function**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each row using `func_1`.
   - The function correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - The function correctly finds the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

### Test Cases

Given the example test cases, let's verify the output:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3 11 1 4
     0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
     0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
     0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Explanation: Building a bridge on the second row minimizes the cost.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4 4 2 1
     0 3 3 0
     0 2 1 0
     0 1 2 0
     0 3 3 0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `8`
   - Explanation: Building bridges on the second and third rows minimizes the cost.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4 5 2 5
     0 1 1 1 0
     0 2 2 2 0
     0 2 1 1 0
     0 3 2 1 0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Explanation: Building bridges on the second and third rows minimizes the cost.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1 8 1 1
     0 10 4 8 4 4 2 0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `14`
   - Explanation: Building a bridge on the only row minimizes the cost.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4 5 3 2
     0 8 4 4 0
     0 3 4 8 0
     0 8 1 10 0
     0 10 1 5 0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `15`
   - Explanation: Building bridges on the second, third, and fourth rows minimizes the cost.
