Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `v2` is `n-1`
   - `v1` is `n-1`
   - `prev` is 0

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `v1` and `v2` are both defined as `n-1`. Since `n` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `v1` and `v2`. However, we know they are equal to each other and both are `n-1`.
   - `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

4. **Substitute Values into the Print Statement:**
   - The format string `f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}'` will be replaced with the actual values of the variables.
   - `{v1}` will be replaced with `n-1`.
   - `{i}` will be replaced with 1.
   - `{v1}` again will be replaced with `n-1`.
   - `{prev}` will be replaced with 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? n-1 1 n-1 0**
