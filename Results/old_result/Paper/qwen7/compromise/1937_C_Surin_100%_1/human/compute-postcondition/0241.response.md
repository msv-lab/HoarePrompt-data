Output State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or 1, `r` is an input string from the user.**

The code `r = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `r`. The values of `i`, `v2`, `v1`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states. The system output buffer being flushed is a state of the environment rather than a variable, so it is not included in the output state.
