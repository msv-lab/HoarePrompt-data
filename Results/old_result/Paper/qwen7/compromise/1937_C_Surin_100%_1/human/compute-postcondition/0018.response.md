Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).
- `v2` is 2.
- The current value of `r` is either unchanged or equal to '<', but since `r` is not used in the print statement, its value does not affect the output.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know `v2` is 2. However, the value of `v1` is not explicitly stated. Since it is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value precisely. Therefore, we will represent it as `v1`.

Output: **? v1 v1 2 2**
