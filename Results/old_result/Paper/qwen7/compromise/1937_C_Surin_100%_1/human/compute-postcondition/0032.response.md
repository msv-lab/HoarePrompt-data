Output State: **`prev` is 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the positive integer input by the user, `v2` is `n-1`, and `r` is an input string from the user. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is also equal to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `prev` to 0. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `v2`, `r`, `v1`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
