Based on the initial state provided:

- `prev` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is mentioned to be at least 2 but does not affect the print statement directly.
- `v2` is explicitly given as 1 but is not used in the print statement.
- `r` is the input string from the user, but it is not used in the print statement either.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Substituting the known values:
- `i` is 2.
- `prev` is 1.

So the print statement becomes:
```python
print(f'? 2 2 1 1')
```

Output: **? 2 2 1 1**
