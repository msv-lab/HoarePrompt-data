Output State: **`r` is '=', `r2` is the input string from the user, and `prev` is `i`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. Since the initial value of `r2` is less than ('<'), it remains unchanged. The values of `r` and `r2` are described as they were initially, and the new variable `prev` is introduced with the value of `i`.
