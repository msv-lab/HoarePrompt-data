Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n`, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either `n-1` or `n-2` based on user inputs, and `g` remains 0.**

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be greater than 3 (since it needs to go through at least 3 iterations). The variable `i` will have reached `n` because the loop increments `i` up to `n-1` and then stops. The variable `v2` retains the last value of `i-1`, which is `n-1`. The variable `v1` also remains `n-1` as it is not changed in the outer loop once set. The variable `prev` will be either `n-1` or `n-2`, depending on the user's responses during the loop iterations, and `g` remains 0 as it was never modified within the loop.
