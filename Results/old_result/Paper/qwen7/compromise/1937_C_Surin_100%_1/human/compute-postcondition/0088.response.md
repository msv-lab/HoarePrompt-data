Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, and no changes were made to the variables by the code.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is displayed immediately. Since no variables are assigned or modified within this line of code, their values remain unchanged.
