Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start with `i = 1` and continue until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 1 or greater, and `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `prev` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than `n-1`.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `v1` is 0.
   - `g` is 0.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, it needs to be adjusted to start from `1` to enter the loop.
   - `n` must be greater than `1` to ensure the loop can execute.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- Adjust `i` to be `1`.
- Ensure `n` is greater than `1`.

Therefore, the modified state should be:

**State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is 0, `g` is 0**.
