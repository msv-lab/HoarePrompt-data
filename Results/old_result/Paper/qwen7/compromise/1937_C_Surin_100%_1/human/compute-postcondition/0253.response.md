Output State: **`i` is `n`, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the user inputs during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending buffered data is written out to the terminal. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `v2`, `v1`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
