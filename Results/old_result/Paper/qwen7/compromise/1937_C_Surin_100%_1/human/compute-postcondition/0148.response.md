Output State: **`r` is the new input string, `prev` is an input integer if `r` was '>', `r2` is the new input string from the user if `r` was '=', and the states of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `r2` has been assigned the value of the new input string provided by the user through the `input()` function. The values of `r`, `prev`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
