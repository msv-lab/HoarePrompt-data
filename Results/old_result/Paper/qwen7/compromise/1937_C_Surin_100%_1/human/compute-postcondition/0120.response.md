Output State: `prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `3`, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `g` is `0`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (from `i=1` to `i=n-1`), the final value of `i` will be `n-1`. At this point, the condition `i < n` in the loop's `for` statement will no longer be satisfied, causing the loop to terminate. The values of `v1` and `v2` will both be set to `n-1` because `v1` is updated to `v2` each time the input `r` is `<`. The variable `prev` remains `n-1` as it was initialized and not altered within the loop. The variable `g` remains `0` as it is not modified by the loop.
