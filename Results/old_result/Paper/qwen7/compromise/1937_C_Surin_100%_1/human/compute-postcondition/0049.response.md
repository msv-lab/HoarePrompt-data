Output State: **`prev` is `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string from the user, `r` is not equal to '>', `r2` is the input string equal to '<', `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Since the initial value of `i` was `n-1`, `prev` now holds the value `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
