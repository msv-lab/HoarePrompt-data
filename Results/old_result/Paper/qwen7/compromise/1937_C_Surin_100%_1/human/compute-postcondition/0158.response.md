Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is an input string.
   - `prev` is either `i` or `i+1`.
   - `i` is `i+1`.
   - `n` is greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i+1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - From the initial state, `i` is set to `i+1`. This means `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `prev` can be either `i` or `i+1`. Since `i` is now `i+1`, `prev` could be either `i` (which is `i+1`) or `i+1`.
   - If `prev` is `i+1`, then `n` is greater than `i+1`. However, this does not affect the values of `i` and `prev` directly in the print statement.

4. **Determine Values:**
   - `i` is `i+1`.
   - `prev` can be either `i` (which is `i+1`) or `i+1`.

Given these conditions, let's consider both possibilities for `prev`:

- If `prev` is `i` (which is `i+1`), the print statement will output:
  ```
  ? i+1 i+1 i+1 i+1
  ```

- If `prev` is `i+1`, the print statement will output:
  ```
  ? i+1 i+1 i+1 i+1
  ```

In both cases, the output is the same.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **? i+1 i+1 i+1 i+1**
