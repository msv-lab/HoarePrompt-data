Output State: **`prev` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 1, `r` is the input string from the user, `r` is updated to the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `r = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. All other variables (`prev`, `i`, `n`, `v2`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid, but since no code directly affects `n`, its value remains unspecified in the output state.
