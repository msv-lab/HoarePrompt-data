Output State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or 1, `r2` is an input from the user.**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `r2`. The values of `i`, `v2`, `v1`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states. The system output buffer is flushed, but this does not affect the variables.
