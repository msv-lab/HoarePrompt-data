Output: **? [v1] [v1] 1 1**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `i` is 1 and `v2` is 1. However, the code snippet provided does not define `v1`. Since `v1` is not defined in the given initial state, it is left as `v1` in the output. The value of `v2` is explicitly given as 1. Therefore, the print statement will output `? [v1] [v1] 1 1`.
