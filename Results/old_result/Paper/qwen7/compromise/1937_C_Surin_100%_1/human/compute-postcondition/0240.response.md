Output State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or 1, the system output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, which means it ensures that any buffered data is written out to the console or file immediately. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `v2`, `v1`, and `prev` remain unchanged, and the system output buffer is flushed.
