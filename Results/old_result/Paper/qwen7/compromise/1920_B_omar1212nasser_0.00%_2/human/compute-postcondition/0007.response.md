Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop depends on the value of `i` and `removals`, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. Specifically, we need to set `i` to 1 and ensure that `removals` is a positive integer (since `removals` represents the number of elements Alice can remove).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `removals`.

**State:**
- `i` is 1
- `removals` must be a positive integer

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`i` is 1, `removals` must be a positive integer**
