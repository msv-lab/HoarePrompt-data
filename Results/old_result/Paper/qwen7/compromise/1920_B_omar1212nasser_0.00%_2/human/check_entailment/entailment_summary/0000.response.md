Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - Alice can remove at most `k` elements from the array.
   - Bob can multiply at most `x` elements by `-1`.
   - Alice aims to maximize the sum of the array.
   - Bob aims to minimize the sum of the array.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
   - Sorts the array `a`.
   - Calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute the result.
   - Prints the result.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - Checks if specific conditions match (removals == 6 and negatives == 3). If true, returns 0.
   - Otherwise, calculates the sum of the entire array (`s`).
   - Calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements (`n`).
   - Iterates through possible removals and updates `s` and `n` accordingly.
   - Stores intermediate results in `pos` and returns the maximum value from `pos`.

4. **Optimal Strategy Verification:**
   - The strategy in `func_2` seems to focus on removing elements and negating elements to balance the sum. However, the specific logic for handling removals and negations might not fully capture the optimal strategy for all cases.
   - The condition check in `func_2` (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) returning 0 is hardcoded and might not cover all scenarios optimally.

5. **Edge Cases and Examples:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement cover various scenarios, including edge cases like when Alice removes all elements or when Bob negates all elements.
   - The implementation in `func_2` seems to handle some edge cases but might miss others, especially when the exact conditions do not match the hardcoded check.

Given the analysis, the current implementation in `func_2` does not fully capture the optimal strategy for all possible values of `removals` and `negatives`. The hardcoded condition check might lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**
