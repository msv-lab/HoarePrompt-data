Reasoning:
The provided program does not actually maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. Instead, it simply prints a sequence of coordinates where each coordinate has the same x-coordinate (1) but different y-coordinates ranging from 1 to \(n\). This configuration does not necessarily maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

To verify correctness, let's consider the example provided for \(n=3\):

- According to the program, the output would be:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  1 3
  ```

- Calculating the Manhattan distances:
  - Distance between (1,1) and (1,2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Distance between (1,1) and (1,3): \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Distance between (1,2) and (1,3): \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)

  Therefore, the set of distances is \(\{1, 2\}\), which has a size of 2. However, the optimal solution for \(n=3\) should have a set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), as mentioned in the problem statement.

Given that the program does not produce the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for general \(n\), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
