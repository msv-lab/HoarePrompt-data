Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for any \(n > 2\). 

For \(n = 2\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
```
This is correct as the set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2.

However, for \(n > 2\), the program simply prints the coordinates \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\). This results in the set of Manhattan distances being \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\), but it misses out on other possible distances, such as those involving cells on the diagonal or near-diagonal positions. For example, for \(n = 3\), the correct set of distances should include 3 (as seen in the example output), but the program only includes 0, 1, and 2.

A correct approach would involve strategically placing cells to maximize the number of distinct distances. For instance, for \(n = 3\), the correct output should include cells like \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) to achieve the set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for \(n > 2\), making it incorrect.
