Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n`.
3. The program then prints `n` points in the format `(1, i)` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. This means it prints points along the first column of the grid.
4. The Manhattan distance between any two points `(1, i)` and `(1, j)` (where `i â‰  j`) is always `|i - j|`, which covers all integers from `1` to `n-1`.
5. Additionally, the distance between any point `(1, i)` and itself is `0`.
6. Therefore, the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) includes `0` and all integers from `1` to `n-1`, making the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) equal to `n`.

Given that the program correctly generates points that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for each test case, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
