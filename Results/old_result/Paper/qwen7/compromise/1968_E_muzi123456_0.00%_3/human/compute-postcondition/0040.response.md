Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be the same as before.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, it does not satisfy the condition `i < n + 1` for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - We cannot change `i` because it is `n + 1` and the loop will not run again.
   - `n` remains the same as before.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case will not occur) would be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**
