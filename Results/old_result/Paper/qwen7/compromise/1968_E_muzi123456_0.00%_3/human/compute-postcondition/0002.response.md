Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive; `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive**.

The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer between 1 and 50, after decrementing, `t` will now be an integer between 0 and 49. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
