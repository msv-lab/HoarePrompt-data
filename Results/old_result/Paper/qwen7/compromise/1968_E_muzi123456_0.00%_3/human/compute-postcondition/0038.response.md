Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to `n + 1`.
2. The print statement is `print('1', end=' ')`.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:

- The `print` function takes the argument `'1'`, which is a string.
- The `end=' '` parameter specifies that after printing the string, it should not move to a new line but instead add a space.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, it doesn't directly affect the print statement. The print statement only outputs the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 **
