Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is `n + 1`.
2. The value of `n` is not explicitly given, but it is stated that `n` must be the same as before. This means `n` retains its previous value.
3. The print statement simply outputs the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is defined as `n + 1`, and `n` is some integer value, `i` will be that integer value plus one.

Output: **n + 1**
