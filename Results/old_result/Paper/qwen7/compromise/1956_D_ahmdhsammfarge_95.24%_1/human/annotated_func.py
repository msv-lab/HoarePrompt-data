    #State: Output State: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` and `r` are the indices `[i, j]` that produce the maximum value of `sm`, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `i` and after index `j`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`. `over_sum` holds this maximum value of `sm`, and the loop has executed all its iterations.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop, `l` and `r` will be the pair of indices that maximize the expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j+1:]) + (j - i + 1)**2`. The variable `over_sum` will store the value of this expression for the optimal pair of indices. The values of `i` and `j` will no longer be used and can be considered as undefined after the loop completes.
    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices `r` and `l` which produce the maximum value of `sm`, where `sm` is defined as the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `l` and after index `r`, plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and returns two indices, `r` and `l`, that maximize the value of `sm`. Here, `sm` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the list before index `l` and after index `r`, plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`. The function iterates through all possible pairs of indices to find the pair that yields the highest value of `sm`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 0 <= r < n, l is an integer such that 0 <= l < n, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.

    #State: `r` is an integer such that 0 <= r < n, `l` is an integer such that 0 <= l < n, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The values of `r` and `l` are not equal.
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: two integers `r` and `l` (both within the range 0 to n-1) and a list `ops`. It recursively appends operations to the list `ops` without returning any value. If `r` equals `l`, it appends a specific operation to `ops` and terminates. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice with decremented `l` and appends another operation to `ops` after each recursive call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers of length n, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), `ops` is a list containing [[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]], and `n` remains unchanged. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is modified such that each element is replaced by 0. Otherwise, the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains unchanged.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list 'lst' where elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are replaced by a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each element being `l - r + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `lst` by replacing the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each set to `l - r + 1`. Additionally, it appends certain operations to the `ops` list and calls another function `func_2` with the same parameters. The function ultimately returns the modified list `lst`.
