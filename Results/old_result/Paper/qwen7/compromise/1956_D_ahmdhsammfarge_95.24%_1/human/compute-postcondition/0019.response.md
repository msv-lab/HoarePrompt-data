Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `i`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2.
   - `l` is 2.
   - `r` is 1.
   - `over_sum` is 3.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `sm` is 3.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(lst)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration).
   - Therefore, `j` will become 3.
   - Since `i` remains unchanged, `i` will still be 0.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `lst` remains the same: a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2.
   - `l` remains 2.
   - `r` remains 1.
   - `over_sum` remains 3.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` becomes 3.
   - `sm` remains 3.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 2, `r` is 1, `over_sum` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is 3**.
