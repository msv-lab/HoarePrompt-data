Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), `ops` is a list containing [[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]], and no changes have been made to the variables.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(r, l, ops)` is called with the given parameters, but the function definition is not provided. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine any changes to the variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains as per the initial state.
