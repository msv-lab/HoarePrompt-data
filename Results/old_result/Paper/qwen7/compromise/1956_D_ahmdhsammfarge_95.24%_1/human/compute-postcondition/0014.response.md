Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `sm` is 3, `r` is 1, `l` is 2**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of the list `[i, j]` to `r` and `l` respectively. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `r` becomes 1 and `l` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
