Output State: **`j` is 4, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[5:]) + (4 - i + 1) ** 2`, and `i` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[5:]) + (4 - i + 1) ** 2`. Here, `j` is 4, so `lst[5:]` refers to the elements from index 5 onwards, which is beyond the actual length of the list (since the list has a length of at least 2). Therefore, `sum(lst[5:])` will be 0 because there are no elements from index 5 onwards. The term `(4 - i + 1) ** 2` calculates the square of the difference between `4 - i + 1`. Since `i` is unchanged, `sm` is now updated based on these conditions. The other variables (`j` and `lst`) remain unchanged.
