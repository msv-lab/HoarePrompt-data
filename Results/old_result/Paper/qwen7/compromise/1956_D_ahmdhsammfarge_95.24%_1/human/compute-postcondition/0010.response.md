Output State: **The program returns a list 'lst' where elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are replaced by a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each element being `l - r + 1`.**

To break this down:
- The initial state tells us that `lst` is a list of non-negative integers.
- Elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are replaced by a list of `n` elements, where `n` is `l - r + 1`.
- Each of these `n` elements is set to `l - r + 1`.
- The operations list `ops` is not directly affecting the final state since the return statement simply returns the modified `lst`.

Given the description, the final state of `lst` is as follows:
- All elements from index `r` to `l` are replaced by a list of `l - r + 1` elements.
- Each of these elements in the new list is equal to `l - r + 1`.
