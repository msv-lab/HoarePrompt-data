Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst). `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The function replaces elements in `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each element being `l - r + 1`, and returns the modified list `lst`.**
