Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j`, `i`, and `lst`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 3.
   - `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2.
   - `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[:r]) + sum(lst[4:]) + (3 - r + 1)`.
   - If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to the current value of `i`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < len(lst)`.
   - Currently, `j` is 3. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 4.
   - The values of `i` and `lst` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 4.
   - `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `lst` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `sm` and `over_sum` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not change for the next iteration.
   - `r` is not part of the loop head either, so its value does not change for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 4, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[:r]) + sum(lst[4:]) + (3 - r + 1)`, and if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to the current value of `i`**.
