Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and returns two indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, where `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `l` and after index `r`, plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`.**
