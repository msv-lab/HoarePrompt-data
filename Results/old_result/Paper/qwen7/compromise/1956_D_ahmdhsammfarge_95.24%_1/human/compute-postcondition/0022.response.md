Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 3, `over_sum` is 3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is 3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1)**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is calculated as `3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1)`, `over_sum` also becomes the same value. All other variables remain unchanged.
