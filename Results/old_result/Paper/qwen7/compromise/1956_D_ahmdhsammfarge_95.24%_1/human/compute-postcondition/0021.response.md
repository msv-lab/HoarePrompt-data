Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 3, `over_sum` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is 3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1)**

Explanation: The line `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l` respectively. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, `r` becomes 3 and `l` becomes 0. The other variables (`over_sum`, `sm`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The expression for `sm` remains as `3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1)`.
