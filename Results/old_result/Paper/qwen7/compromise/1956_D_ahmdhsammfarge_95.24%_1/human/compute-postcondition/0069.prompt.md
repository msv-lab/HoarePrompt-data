Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and len(lst) is an integer such that 1 <= len(lst) <= 18; `l` is 0; `r` is 0; `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(lst)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
        sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
        if sm > over_sum:
            r, l = [i, j]
            over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 3, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 9, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first one plus 9.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `j` being equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` remaining as a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` being the sum of all elements in `lst` from index `i` to the second last element plus 1 (since `j` will be one past the last valid index), `r` being `i`, and `l` being the last index of `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `sm` will be the maximum value of the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`. The variables `r` and `l` will be set to the indices `[i, j]` that produce this maximum value of `sm`. `over_sum` will also hold this maximum value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
