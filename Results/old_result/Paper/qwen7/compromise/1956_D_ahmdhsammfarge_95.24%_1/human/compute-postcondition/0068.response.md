Output State: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `l` is the index `i` that, along with the index `j`, gives the maximum value of `sm`, `r` is the index `j` that, along with the index `i`, gives the maximum value of `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` which is the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `i` and after index `j`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`, `i` and `j` are the indices that produce this maximum value of `sm`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `l` and `r` will hold the indices of the sublist within `lst` that maximizes the value of `sm`, which is calculated as the sum of elements outside the sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist. `over_sum` will store this maximum value of `sm`.
