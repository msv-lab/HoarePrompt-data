Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `sm` is 3, `r` is 1, `l` is 2**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` (which is 3) to `over_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
