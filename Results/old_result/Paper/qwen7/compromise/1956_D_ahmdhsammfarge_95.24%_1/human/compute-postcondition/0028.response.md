Output State: **`j` is 2, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including index `i`, plus the sum of elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst`, plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `sm` using the specified formula, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state and the code does not assign a value to it, `i` remains undefined. The other variables (`j` and `lst`) retain their initial states, and `sm` is calculated based on the given formula.
