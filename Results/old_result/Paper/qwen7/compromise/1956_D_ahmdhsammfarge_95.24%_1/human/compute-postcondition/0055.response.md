Postcondition: `sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i` and `l` is set to `j`. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, there is no change to `r` and `l`.
