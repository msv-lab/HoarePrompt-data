Output State: **`sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `sm` based on the sum of elements in the list `lst` before index `i` and after index `j`, plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `lst`, `i`, and `j`, the final state only describes what `sm` represents in terms of the list and indices. The values of `lst`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
