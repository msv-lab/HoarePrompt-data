Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, len(lst) must be at least 1 and at most 18, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `i` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `sm` is equal to `over_sum - lst[0] + 1`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, the condition cannot be true since `sm` is defined as `over_sum - lst[0] + 1`, which is always less than or equal to `over_sum`. Therefore, the if part does not change any variable values, and the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 2, `r` is 1, `over_sum` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `sm` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 3, `over_sum` is 3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is 3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1). If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `sm` remains unchanged and the other variables retain their values. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, then the values of `l` and `r` change to 0 and 3 respectively, while `over_sum`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain as they were.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
