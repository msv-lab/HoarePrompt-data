### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations where each operation sets a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray. The MEX value of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Function Summaries Recap
1. **func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):**
   - Modifies the list `lst` by replacing the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each set to `l - r + 1`.
   - Appends certain operations to the `ops` list and calls another function `func_2` with the same parameters.
   - Returns the modified list `lst`.

2. **func_2(r, l, ops: list):**
   - Recursively constructs a sequence of operations.
   - Appends operations to the `ops` list.

3. **func_1(lst):**
   - Intended to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.
   - Iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates the sum of the subarray plus the contribution from the remaining parts of the array, and keeps track of the best subarray found.
   - However, the logic here is flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the MEX and the new sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **func_1(lst):**
   - The function attempts to find the optimal subarray by calculating the sum of subarrays and their contributions. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX value and the new sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value. This is a significant flaw.

2. **func_2(r, l, ops: list):**
   - This function is intended to build a sequence of operations but does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum sum. It simply appends operations without considering the MEX value.

3. **func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):**
   - This function incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray instead of the MEX value. It also includes redundant operations and does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. For example, it appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` twice, which is unnecessary.

Given these issues, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as stated. They do not correctly compute the MEX value and the new sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value, and they include redundant operations.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly solve the problem according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
