### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To find the subarray that maximizes the sum of elements before and after the subarray, plus the square of the subarray's length.
- **Logic**: The function calculates `sm` as the sum of elements before index `i` and after index `j`, plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. This is not related to the MEX operation, which is crucial for solving the problem. The function aims to maximize a different metric, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To recursively append operations to the `ops` list.
- **Logic**: The function simply appends operations without performing any MEX calculations or modifying the array. It seems to be a placeholder or helper function, but it does not contribute to the solution.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Purpose**: To modify the array `lst` by setting elements in the subarray `[r, l]` to the length of the subarray (`l - r + 1`).
- **Logic**: The function replaces the subarray `[r, l]` with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each set to `l - r + 1`. This operation is not equivalent to setting the subarray to the MEX of the subarray. The MEX operation involves finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, which is not implemented here.

#### Main Program Logic:
- **Initial Call**: The main program calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray indices.
- **Modification Loop**: The program repeatedly calls `func_3` to modify the array using the indices found by `func_1`.
- **Post-processing**: After the loop, the program tries to set elements to 1 if they are 0, which is unnecessary and does not align with the MEX operation.

Given the above analysis, the functions do not correctly implement the required logic. The main issue is that none of the functions handle the MEX operation, which is essential for solving the problem. Instead, they focus on a different metric or perform unnecessary operations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

**Final: False**
