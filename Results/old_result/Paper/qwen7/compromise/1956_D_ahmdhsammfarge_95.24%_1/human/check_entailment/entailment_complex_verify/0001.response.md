### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of an array \(a\) by performing up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, where each operation involves setting a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`)
This function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum. The logic is as follows:
- It iterates through all possible subarrays.
- For each subarray, it calculates the sum of the subarray plus the contributions from the remaining parts of the array.
- It keeps track of the best subarray found.

However, the key issue is that it does not correctly compute the MEX value and the resulting sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value. The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and the sum should reflect the change after setting the subarray to this MEX value.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`)
This function is intended to recursively construct a sequence of operations. However, it does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum sum. Specifically:
- It appends operations to the list `ops` but does not actually compute the MEX or update the array values.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`)
This function is supposed to perform the actual operation on the subarray and record the operation. However, it is incorrect in several ways:
- It incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray instead of the MEX value.
- It includes redundant operations and does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function iterates through all possible subarrays, but it does not correctly compute the MEX value and the resulting sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value.
   - The logic is flawed because it does not account for the MEX value properly.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is intended to build a sequence of operations but does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It appends operations to the list `ops` but does not actually compute the MEX or update the array values.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray instead of the MEX value.
   - It includes redundant operations and does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.

### Conclusion
Given the detailed analysis, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as stated. They fail to compute the MEX value and the resulting sum accurately, and they do not correctly update the array values.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem according to the problem description.
