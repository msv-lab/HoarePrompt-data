Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the recursion limit is set to 10 ** 6**.

Explanation: The code `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\). This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `w`. Therefore, the only change is to the recursion limit, which is now set to \(10^6\). The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, and `w` remain unchanged.
