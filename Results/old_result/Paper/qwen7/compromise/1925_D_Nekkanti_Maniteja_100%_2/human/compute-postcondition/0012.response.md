Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a` + `f`, `m` must be greater than 0, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer.**

The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by `f`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `a` is the original value of `a` plus `f`.
