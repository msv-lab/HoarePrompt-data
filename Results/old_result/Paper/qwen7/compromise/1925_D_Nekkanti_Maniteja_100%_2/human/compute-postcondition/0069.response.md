Output State: `i` is `i_prev + (3 * 6)`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + (3 * 6)`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, repeated for each iteration, `a` is increased by `f` for each iteration, and `a` is now the sum of all `f` values provided by the input over all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `i_prev + 18`, `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 18`, `u`, `v`, and `f` will contain the last set of inputs provided by the user, and `a` will be the total sum of all `f` values provided as input.
