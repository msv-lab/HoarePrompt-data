Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 3, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the given bounds, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations minus one, `M` stays constant at 1000000007, `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` remains 0, `a` is the cumulative sum of all `f` values read from the input, `m` must have been greater than the number of iterations minus one, and `u`, `v`, and `f` are the last set of input integers provided.
