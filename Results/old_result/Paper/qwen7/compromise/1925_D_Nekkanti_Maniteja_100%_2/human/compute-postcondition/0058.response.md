Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range object defined by `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The problem states that `i` is defined as `i_prev + 6`. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be within the range defined by `m`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `m` is greater than or equal to `i`. Given that `i` is initially set to `i_prev + 6`, we need to ensure that `i_prev + 6` is less than or equal to `m`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to start executing. This means `i` should be initialized to `i_prev + 6` and `m` should be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `i_prev + 6`.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `i_prev + 6`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`**
