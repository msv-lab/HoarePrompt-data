Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i_prev + 6`
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`
   - `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split
   - `a` is increased by `f`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 (`i = i_prev + 6 + 1 = i_prev + 7`).
   - For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 7`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 7`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 7`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is increased by `f`**
