Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` which are within the specified ranges.
3. The variable `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\) as required.
4. The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is used later in the calculation.
5. The variable `s` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of the friendship values.
6. The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the sum of friendship values from the input pairs.
7. In the loop that processes the `m` pairs of friends, it correctly accumulates the sum of the friendship values into `a`.
8. The main logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values involves using the modular multiplicative inverse `c` and the number of pairs `m`. However, the formula used in the code is incorrect. The correct formula should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair in each excursion and the expected increase in the friendship value due to previous choices.
9. The final result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The provided solution does not account for the probabilistic nature of choosing pairs and the cumulative effect of increasing friendship values.

Correctness: **False**
