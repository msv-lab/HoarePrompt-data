Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used in the program does not accurately calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given conditions. Specifically, the program attempts to divide the counts of each type of number by 2 and add them up, which does not align with the rules of the game or the objective of maximizing Bob's wins. The correct approach involves ensuring that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible, which requires a different strategy.
