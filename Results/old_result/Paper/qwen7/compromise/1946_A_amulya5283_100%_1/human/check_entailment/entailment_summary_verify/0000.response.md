### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the minimum number of operations to strictly increase the median of the array.
- The median is defined as the middle element in a sorted array. If \( n \) is odd, the median is the element at index \( \left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil - 1 \). If \( n \) is even, the median is the average of the elements at indices \( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \) and \( \frac{n}{2} \).

#### Program Analysis:
- The program sorts the array and then counts the number of elements equal to the median in the sorted array.
- The logic in the program does not account for the requirement that the median must be strictly increased. It only counts the number of elements equal to the median, which is not sufficient to ensure the median is increased.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  3
  4
  7 3 3 1
  ```
- The program sorts the array to `[1, 3, 3, 7]`.
- The median is `3` (since \( n = 4 \), the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements).
- The program counts the number of `3`s, which is `2`.
- However, to strictly increase the median, we need to make sure the median value itself increases. In this case, increasing any two `3`s to `4` would result in the array `[1, 3, 4, 7]` with a median of `3.5`, which is strictly greater than `3`.

#### Correct Approach:
- To strictly increase the median, we need to find the smallest element that is greater than the current median and count how many such elements exist.
- If the current median is not unique, we need to ensure that the next smallest element is also considered.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function summary states that the program counts the number of consecutive occurrences of the middle element(s) from the middle index towards the end of the list. This is incorrect because it does not ensure the median is strictly increased.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to strictly increase the median of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
