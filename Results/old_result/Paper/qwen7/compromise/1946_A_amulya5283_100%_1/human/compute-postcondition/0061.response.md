Output State: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()), `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, or `a`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
