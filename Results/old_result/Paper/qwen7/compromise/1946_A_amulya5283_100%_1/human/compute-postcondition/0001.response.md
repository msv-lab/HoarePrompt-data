State right before the while loop: `t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and the array `a` contains `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). Additionally, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer.

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
