Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while t > 0:`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This means that `t` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration.

3. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop executes again, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was `t - 1` in the previous iteration, `t` must be set to a value that is still greater than 0. The simplest way to achieve this is to set `t` back to a value greater than 0, such as `t = 1` (or any positive integer).

Given the constraints and the loop condition, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
