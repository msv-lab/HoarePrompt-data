Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is initially greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This condition can only be true if `t` is 1 (since 1 is greater than 0 and 1 - 1 equals 0). The code then assigns the value of the input to `n`, which is an integer obtained from the user. The state of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is now an integer input.
