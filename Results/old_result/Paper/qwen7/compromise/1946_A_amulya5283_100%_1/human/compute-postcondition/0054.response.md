Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string. If `n` equals 1, the values remain unchanged. Otherwise, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must still be greater than `mdx`, and `res` will be the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` from index `mdx` to index `n-1`.**
