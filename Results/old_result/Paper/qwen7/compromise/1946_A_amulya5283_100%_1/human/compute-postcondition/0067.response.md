Postcondition: `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must satisfy `mdx < n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `res` is 1, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and either the middle index `mdx` of list `a` is equal to index `i` and `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, or there is no change in `res` (which remains 0).
