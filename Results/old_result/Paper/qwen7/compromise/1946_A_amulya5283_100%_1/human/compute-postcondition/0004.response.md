Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
