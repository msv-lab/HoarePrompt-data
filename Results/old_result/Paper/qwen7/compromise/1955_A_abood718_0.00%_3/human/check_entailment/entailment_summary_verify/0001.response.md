### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Price vs Regular Price**:
   - The program checks if the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price for one yogurt (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying them at the regular price.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means buying individual yogurts at the regular price is cheaper.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the total cost by dividing `A` by 2 and multiplying by `C` (promotional price for two yogurts).
     - This is correct because if `A` is even, you can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` is odd, the program first calculates how many pairs of yogurts can be bought (`X = A // 2`).
   - It then prints `X` (which is the number of pairs) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price (`B`).
     - This is correct because if `A` is odd, you can buy as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buy the remaining one at the regular price.

#### Example Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Output: `9`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 = 10 > 9`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts for 9 burles. So, the cost is 9.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Output: `14`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 = 10 > 9`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts for 9 burles. Buying two at 9 and one at 5 gives a total of 14.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Output: `15`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 = 10 < 11`, it is cheaper to buy individual yogurts at 5 burles each. So, the cost is 15.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Output: `20`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 = 10 < 11`, it is cheaper to buy individual yogurts at 5 burles each. So, the cost is 20.

#### Function Summary Verification

The function summary states that the function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible values based on specific conditions: `A * B`, `int(A * C / 2)`, or `X` followed by `X * C + B`, where `X` is defined as `A // 2`. The function reads the number of test cases from the first input, then iterates through each test case, performing the necessary calculations and printing the results.

Based on the analysis and the example test cases, the program correctly handles both scenarios (even and odd number of yogurts) and the logic for comparing the promotional price and the regular price is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
