Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. However, this logic is incomplete. According to the problem description, a rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles by cutting parallel to one of its sides, and these smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle. 

The current implementation fails to consider cases where both dimensions are odd but can still form a new rectangle. For example, a 3x5 rectangle can be cut into two 3x2.5 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 6x2.5 rectangle, which is not considered in the current logic. Therefore, the program incorrectly returns 'No' for such cases.

A correct approach would involve checking if the product of the dimensions (i.e., `a * b`) is greater than the sum of the dimensions (i.e., `a + b`). This condition ensures that the original rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
