### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and edge cases of the program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure completeness and accuracy:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - According to the problem statement, Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them.
   - The key insight is that if either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with at least one even side, allowing him to rearrange them into a different rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle is into two 1x1 squares, which do not allow forming a different rectangle.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where both `a` and `b` are odd by returning 'No'.
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies this scenario and returns 'No' for such cases.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which matches the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given dimensions. The conditions and logic align perfectly with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and logic. Therefore, there is no need to overturn the original assessment.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
