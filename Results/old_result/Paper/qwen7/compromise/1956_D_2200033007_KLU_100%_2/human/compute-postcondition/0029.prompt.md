You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, and res is an initially empty list that will store the operations performed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: Output State: `is_already_stairs` is False.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop sets `is_already_stairs` to `False` if any element in the specified slice of `arr` does not match its index. Since the loop runs for `i + 1` times, checking each element from `start_index` to `start_index + i`, if even one element does not match its index, `is_already_stairs` will be set to `False`. Given that the initial state of `is_already_stairs` is `True`, it will only remain `True` if all elements in the slice match their indices. Otherwise, it will be set to `False` after the first mismatch.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and all elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i` either match their indices or a mismatch was found during the iteration.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code. The current state of the variables remains unchanged.
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and all elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i` either match their indices or a mismatch was found during the iteration. **`i` is not equal to 0**.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: Output State: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are equal to `i`. The element at `arr[start_index + i]` is undefined, and the element at `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and either:
    #- All elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 2` either match their indices or a mismatch was found during the iteration, and the current value of `arr[start_index + i - 1]` matches `i - 1`. In this case, `arr[start_index + i]` is undefined.
    #- All elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are equal to `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Additionally, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and the element at `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an index `i` and performs operations on the list `arr` and the list `res`, but does not return any value. The state of the variables remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code. The current state of the variables remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
