### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function appears to be a recursive function that computes the maximum sum of a subarray by considering all possible ways to split the subarray into two parts and adding the MEX value of the middle element.
- However, the problem description specifies that we need to set a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray, not just add it.
- The function `func_1` does not actually perform any operations to set subarrays to MEX values; instead, it computes a value that might be useful for determining the optimal operations.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function is supposed to find the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
- It uses `func_1` to find the maximum sum and then tries to reconstruct the operations that lead to this sum.
- However, the logic inside `func_2` does not correctly implement the required operations. It seems to be trying to find a way to achieve the maximum sum by splitting the array and considering different subarrays, but it does not actually set the subarrays to the MEX values.

#### Function `make_stairs`:
- This function is intended to create a "staircase" pattern in the array, where the elements are set to their respective indices.
- However, the function does not correctly implement the logic to set the subarrays to MEX values. It simply checks if the array already has a staircase pattern and modifies it if necessary.

Given the above analysis, the functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They do not set subarrays to MEX values and do not return the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
