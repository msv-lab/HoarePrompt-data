Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it calculates a value \(k\) based on specific conditions involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). If certain conditions are met, the function prints \(-1\) and terminates without further calculations. Otherwise, it prints the calculated value \(k\). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
