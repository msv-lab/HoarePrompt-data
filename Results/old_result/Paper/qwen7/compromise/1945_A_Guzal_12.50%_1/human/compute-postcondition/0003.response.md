Output State: The value of `k` will be the sum of `a` from each iteration plus the quotient of `(b + c) // 3`, plus an additional 1 for every iteration where `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. If during any iteration the condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is met, the program will print -1 and terminate without adding to `k`.
