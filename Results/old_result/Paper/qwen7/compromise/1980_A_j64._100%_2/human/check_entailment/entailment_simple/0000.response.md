Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the number of additional problems needed by assuming that `m` is always greater than or equal to the maximum value in `count`. However, this is not necessarily true, and the function should only add `m - count[i]` when `count[i]` is less than `m`.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Assumption**: The function assumes that `m` is always greater than or equal to the maximum value in `count`, which is not guaranteed. For example, if `m = 1` and `count` is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, the function would incorrectly calculate that 7 problems are needed, when in fact no additional problems are needed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function should only increment `needed_problems` when `count[i]` is less than `m`. Currently, it increments `needed_problems` by `m - count[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 6, regardless of whether `count[i]` is less than `m`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    return needed_problems
```

This corrected function correctly calculates the minimum number of problems needed to ensure that each of the `m` rounds can have at least one problem of each difficulty level.

Correctness: **False**
