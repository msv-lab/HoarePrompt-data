### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the specified operations.
   - Each operation involves choosing `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`.
   - It returns a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list `arr`, and the corresponding value is the maximum count of that number in the list, capped at `k`.
   - This means `func_1` does not perform the actual exchange operations; it only limits the frequency of each number to `k`.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers.
   - If `k > n`, it prints `n` (which is incorrect, as the minimum number of cards cannot be greater than `n`).
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` and checks if `k` is in the returned frequency table.
     - If `k` is in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`:
     - `func_1` will return `{1: 2, 4: 3}`.
     - Since `4` is in the frequency table, the program prints `4 - 1 = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2`.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify groups of `k` cards with the same number and reduce their count to `k-1`.
   - We should count the total number of cards and subtract the number of full groups of `k` cards, then add the remaining cards.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` only limits the frequency of each number to `k` without performing the necessary exchanges to minimize the number of cards. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results for most test cases.

**Final: False**
