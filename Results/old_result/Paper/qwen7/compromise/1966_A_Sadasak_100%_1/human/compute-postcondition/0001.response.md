Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num`, which iterates over the elements of `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since the loop starts iterating over each element of `arr`, the first value of `num` will be the first element of `arr`.

3. **Determine the state of `arr`**: The list `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not run.

4. **Consider the role of `frequency_table`**: The `frequency_table` is not used in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

5. **Initial state of `num`**: Before the loop starts, `num` does not have a specific value yet, but it will take the value of the first element of `arr` in the first iteration.

Based on these steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `arr` must contain at least one element, and `num` will take the value of the first element of `arr` in the first iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
