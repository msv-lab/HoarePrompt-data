Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are both 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values.**

The code initializes an empty list named `val`. This operation does not affect the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values.
