Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative.
   - `p1` is either 0 or 1.
   - `p2` is either 0 or 1.
   - `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will run for `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `2` if the loop continues.

5. **Check the conditions inside the loop**:
   - If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then `p2` becomes 1.
   - If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is 1 and `p1` is 1, otherwise `p2` remains either 0 or 1.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `p1` and `p2` will retain their current values unless they change inside the loop. Since no specific changes are mentioned for `p1` and `p2` in the given conditions, they will remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
- `i` will be 2.
- `p1` and `p2` will retain their original values (either 0 or 1).

State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `i` is 2.**
