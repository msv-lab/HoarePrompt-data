Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, `m` is `m - 1`, `t` retains its original value.**

The value of `m` is decremented by 1, while the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
