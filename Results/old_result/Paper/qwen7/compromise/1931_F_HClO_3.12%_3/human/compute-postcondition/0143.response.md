Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l3` is a valid list of integers excluding `a3`.
   - If `l3` is not a list of integers excluding `a3`, the loop breaks.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is at least 5.
   - `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int.
   - `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int.
   - The next pair `(a4, l4)` is valid, where `l4` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l3` must still be a valid list of integers excluding `a3`.
   - Since the next pair `(a4, l4)` is valid, it means `l4` is a valid list of integers excluding `a4`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `m` remains at least 5.
   - `a3` becomes `a4` because the loop is moving to the next pair.
   - `l3` becomes `l4` because the loop is using the next valid pair.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the second integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`.**

State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the second integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`.**
