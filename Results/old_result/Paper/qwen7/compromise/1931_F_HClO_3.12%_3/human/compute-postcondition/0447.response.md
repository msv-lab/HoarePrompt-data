Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three variables t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and n ⋅ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function also receives a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, inclusive, for each test case. It returns a result based on the conditions provided for n and k, and the list of integers.**

This means the function processes multiple inputs indirectly through variables and a list, determining the relationship between n, k, and the list of integers, without directly accepting these as parameters.
