Based on the initial state provided:

- `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer.
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and it must have at least one element.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement will print the string `'no'` directly without any modification or additional context from the variables `a3` or `l3`.

Output: **no**
