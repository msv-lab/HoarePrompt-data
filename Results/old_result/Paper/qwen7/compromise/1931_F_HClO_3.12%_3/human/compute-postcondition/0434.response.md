Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` from the list `val`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`.
   - `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`.
   - `m` is equal to 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple in `val`. Since `val` contains four tuples, the loop will iterate four times.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `a3` would be the first element of the second tuple in `val`, and `l3` would be the second element of the second tuple in `val`.
   - The list `val` remains the same.
   - The variable `m` does not change within the loop body based on the information given.

5. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - `a3` changes to the first element of the second tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` changes to the second element of the second tuple in `val`.
   - `val` remains the same.
   - `m` remains 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4**.
