Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2`, `l1` retains its original values, `l11` retains its original values, `l22` retains its original values, `l3` retains its original values, `m` retains its original values, `t` retains its original values.**

The code `l = l1` simply assigns the reference of `l1` to the variable `l`. This does not change the values of any variables or lists; it only changes which list `l` refers to. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
