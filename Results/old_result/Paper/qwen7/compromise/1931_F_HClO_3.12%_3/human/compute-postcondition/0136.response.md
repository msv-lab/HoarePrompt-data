Postcondition: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int, and after executing the if-else block, if the current list `l3` is not equal to a new list created by taking all elements from `l` except those equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
