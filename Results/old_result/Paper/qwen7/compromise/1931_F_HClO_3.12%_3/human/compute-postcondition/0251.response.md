Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, `m` retains its original value, `t` retains its original value, and `a1`, `a2`, and `l11`, `l22` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code reads multiple integers from the input and splits them into two parts using the `map` function. The first integer is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are stored in the list `l3`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `m`, `t`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged from their initial states.
