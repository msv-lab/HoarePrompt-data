Postcondition: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is an empty list, `m` is equal to 2, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input. If the index of `a3` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l` is a list with `a3` inserted at position `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` is a list with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.
