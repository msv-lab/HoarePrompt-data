Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values.**

The code initializes two variables `p1` and `p2` to 0. All other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t`) retain their original values from the initial state.
