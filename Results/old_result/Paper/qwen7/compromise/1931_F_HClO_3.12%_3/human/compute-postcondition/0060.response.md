Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are both `i`; `n` is greater than 1; if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` and `idx2` to the same value, which is `i`. This changes the values of `idx1` and `idx2` but does not affect the values of `p1`, `p2`, `n`, the condition involving `i`, `max(p1, p2)`, and the comparison between `l1[i + 1 + p1]` and `l2[i + 1 + p2]`.
