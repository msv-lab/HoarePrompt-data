Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The conditions involving `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `i`, and `val` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
