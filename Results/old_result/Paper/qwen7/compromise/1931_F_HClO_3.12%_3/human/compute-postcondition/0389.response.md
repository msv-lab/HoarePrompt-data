Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in list `l2`, and `l` is now a reference to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns `l2` to `l`, meaning `l` now references the same list as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
