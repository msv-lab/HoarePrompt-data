Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` and `-1`, `-1` and `i`, or `i` and `i`.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `previous_i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is an upper bound for the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `p1` and `p2` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` may change based on the increment of `i`. However, since the problem does not specify how `idx1` and `idx2` change, we assume they remain the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - The condition `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` still holds true for the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i+1` and `-1`, `-1` and `i+1`, or `i+1` and `i+1`; `n` is greater than 1; if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`**.
