Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `t` must be greater than `current_index + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer (`a1`), `m` is the second integer from the input split and converted to an integer (not included in the list `l1`), `a2` is the third integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a2` and the rest to the list `l2`. The initial values of `a3`, `l3`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
