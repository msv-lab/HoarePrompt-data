Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, input has been taken 3 times but not stored or used.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since the loop had already executed `m-2` times and `m` was greater than or equal to 3, the `continue` statement does not change the value of `m`. The input has been requested 3 times during these iterations, but the inputs themselves are not stored or used within the loop. Therefore, the condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 and that input has been taken 3 times but not stored or used remains unchanged.
