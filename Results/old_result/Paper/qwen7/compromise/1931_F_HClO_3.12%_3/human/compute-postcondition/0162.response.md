Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m - 2` must still be greater than 0. This implies that `m` must be greater than 2. Since `m` was already greater than or equal to 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain greater than 2 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `m` remains greater than or equal to 3 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
