Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l11` is a list containing all elements of `l1` except `a2`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a3` is the last integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, and `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the second input.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements of `l1` except for `a2`. The original lists `l1` and `l2`, and the variables `a1`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `t`, `a2` remain unchanged.
