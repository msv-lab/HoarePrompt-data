Let's analyze the given state and the loop step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative.
- `p1` is either 0 or 1.
- `p2` is either 0 or 1.
- `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).

### Loop Body:
The loop body checks the conditions:
- If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 0.
- Otherwise, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Current Value of `i`:
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged unless the conditions in the loop body are met.
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.
- `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values.
- `i` becomes 1.

### Final State:
State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `i` is 1.**
