Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing one tuple (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts using `map(int, input().split())`. The first part is assigned to `a3`, and the rest is unpacked into `l3`. The initial conditions that `m` must be at least 4 and `val` contains the tuple `(a3, l3)` remain valid.
