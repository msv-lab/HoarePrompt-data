Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `l` is equal to `l2`.**

The code `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. Since `l2` has `a2` inserted at index 2, `l` now also contains `a2` at index 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
