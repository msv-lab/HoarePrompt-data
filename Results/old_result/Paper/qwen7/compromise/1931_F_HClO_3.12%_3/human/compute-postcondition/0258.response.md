Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, `m` retains its original value, `t` retains its original value, and `a1`, `a2`, and `l11`, `l22` retain their original values. Additionally, `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`. `l3` has `a2` inserted at index 2.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a2` into the list `l3` at the index specified by `idx1`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
