Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m == 1:
        input()
        print('yes')
        continue
    a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())
    a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())
    l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]
    l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]
    if l11 != l22:
        for _ in range(m - 2):
            input()
        print('no')
        continue
    idx1 = idx2 = -1
    p1 = p2 = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
            break
        if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
                idx1 = idx2 = i
                break
            else:
                if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                    idx1 = i
                    p1 = 1
                else:
                    idx2 = i
                    p2 = 1
                if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                    break
    val = []
    if idx1 < idx2:
        l2.insert(idx1, a2)
        l = l2
    elif idx1 > idx2:
        l1.insert(idx2, a1)
        l = l1
    else:
        if m == 2:
            print('yes')
            continue
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):
            l1.insert(idx2, a1)
            l = l1
        else:
            l2.insert(idx1, a2)
            l = l2
        val.append((a3, l3))
        m -= 1
    for _ in range(m - 2):
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        val.append((a3, l3))
    for a3, l3 in val:
        if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
            print('no')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the last integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is an empty list, and the program prints 'yes' after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and if `l3` contains all elements of `l` except `a3`, the program prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it will have broken out of the loop at some point and printed 'no' before completing all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a3` is the first element of the fourth tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the fourth tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
