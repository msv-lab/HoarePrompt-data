Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` from the list `val`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`.
   - `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`.
   - `m` is equal to 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple in `val`. Since `val` contains four tuples, the loop will iterate four times.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a3` and `l3` were the first and second elements of the second tuple in `val`.
   - The next iteration will start with the third tuple in `val`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `a3` will be the first element of the third tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` will be the second element of the third tuple in `val`.

6. **Consider the postconditions**: The loop continues as long as `l3` is not a list where all elements are not equal to `a3`. However, since we are only adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time, we don't need to consider this condition explicitly here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4**.
