Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the values of `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remain unchanged. Additionally, since the `break` statement is encountered, we indicate that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
