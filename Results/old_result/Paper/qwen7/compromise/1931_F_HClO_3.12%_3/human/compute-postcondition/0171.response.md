Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. No other variables are affected, so their original values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `idx1` and `idx2`, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
