Output State: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either both `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1; `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` but no further changes occur due to the conditions in the loop; the loop terminates when either `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1` or both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `p1` and `p2` will still be either 0 or 1, and `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to either `n-1` or `n` depending on where the loop breaks. The values of `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `m`, and `idx1`, `idx2` will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, with the loop terminating based on the conditions provided.
