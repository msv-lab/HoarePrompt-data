Postcondition: `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, `m` retains its original value, `t` retains its original value, and `a1`, `a2`, and `l11`, `l22` retain their original values. Additionally, the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.
