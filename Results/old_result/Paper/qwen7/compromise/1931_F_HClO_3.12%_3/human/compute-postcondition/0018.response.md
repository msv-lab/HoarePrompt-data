Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, input received but not stored**.

The code `input()` reads user input but does not store it in any variable. Therefore, the initial condition that `m` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged. The input received is stored in the default input buffer but no variable is updated with this value.
