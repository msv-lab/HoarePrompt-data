Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, and `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from `l1` except for `a2`. The values of `a1`, `n`, `m`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
