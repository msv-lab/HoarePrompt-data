Output State: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either both `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1; `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, where `i` is `n-1` or `n-2`; if `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `p1` and `p2` will still be 0 or 1, depending on which character was mismatched first. The indices `idx1` and `idx2` will either both be `n-1` (indicating the end of the strings), or one will be `n` and the other `n-1` (indicating a mismatch at the last possible position). The value of `n` will remain unchanged and must be greater than 1. The condition `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]` will hold true when the loop terminates, meaning the characters at the last possible positions in both strings are the same.
