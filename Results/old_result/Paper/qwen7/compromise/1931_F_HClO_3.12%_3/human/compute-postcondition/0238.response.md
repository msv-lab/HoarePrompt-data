Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `2`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`, which is 2. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `a1`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged. Note that `idx1` being less than `idx2` is no longer true since they are both 2 now.
