Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `(a3, l3)` which are unpacked from the tuples in the list `val`.

2. **Understand the List `val`**: The list `val` contains five tuples, each of which is (`a3`, `l3`). For the loop to execute, `val` must contain at least one tuple.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from each of the inputs converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input converted to int, and `val` is a list containing five tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the second tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the third tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the fourth tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the fifth tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop will iterate over each tuple in `val`, `val` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute. The initial state already indicates that `val` contains five tuples, so no adjustment is needed for `val` itself. However, the loop will start with the first tuple in `val`, so we need to ensure that `a3` and `l3` correspond to the first tuple in `val`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `a3` should be the first integer from the first input converted to int.
- `l3` should be the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int.
- `val` must contain at least one tuple, but since the initial state already indicates that `val` contains five tuples, no additional adjustment is needed for `val`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int**.
