Postcondition: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is a list. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `val` is an empty list, `l` references a list `l2` with an element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. Otherwise, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)` or `l` references a list `l1` with an element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `m` is equal to 1, where `a3` is the first integer input and `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input.
