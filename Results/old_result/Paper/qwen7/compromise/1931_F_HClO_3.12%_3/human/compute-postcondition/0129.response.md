Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`), and the third tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`). After executing the code, `val` now contains three tuples: the first and second tuples remain unchanged, and the third tuple is the newly appended one (`a3`, `l3`). The values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
