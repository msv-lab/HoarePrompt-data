Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code sets both `idx1` and `idx2` to the value of `i`. The conditions involving `m`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
