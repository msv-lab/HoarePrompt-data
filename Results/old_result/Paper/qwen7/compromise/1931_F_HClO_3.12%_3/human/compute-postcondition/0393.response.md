Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted at position `idx2` in list `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`. Since `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `a1` is inserted at one of these positions. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
