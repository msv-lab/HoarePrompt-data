Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, `m` retains its original value, `t` retains its original value, and `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index 2.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
