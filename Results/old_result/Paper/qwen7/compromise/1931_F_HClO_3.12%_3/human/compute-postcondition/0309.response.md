Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(m - 2):` statement. This means the loop will run from 0 to `m - 3` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `m` must be at least 3, and no other variables have been initialized or modified.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 4.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop is controlled by `m`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 4, we need to update the state accordingly.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` must be at least 4**
