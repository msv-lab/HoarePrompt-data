Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `a3` or `l3`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. Therefore, the values of `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged.
