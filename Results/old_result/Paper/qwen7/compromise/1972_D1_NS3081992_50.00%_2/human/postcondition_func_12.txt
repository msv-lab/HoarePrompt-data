The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with `b` being non-zero) and returns a tuple containing three elements: `x`, `y`, and `g`. If `b` is zero, it returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` unchanged. Otherwise, it recursively calculates `x`, `y`, and `g` using the values of `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and returns `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`.
