Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It returns 1 if a certain condition is met; otherwise, it returns -1.**

This means the function checks a specific condition using the list `a`, the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and returns either 1 or -1 based on whether that condition is true or false.
