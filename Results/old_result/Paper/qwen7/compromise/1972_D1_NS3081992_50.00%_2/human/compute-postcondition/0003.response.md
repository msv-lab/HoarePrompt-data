Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop condition is `i * i <= n + i`.
2. We need to determine if the loop can execute at least once with the given initial values.
3. The initial values are:
   - `ans` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is 1.

4. Substitute `i = 1` into the loop condition:
   \[
   1 * 1 \leq n + 1 \implies 1 \leq n + 1
   \]
5. Since `n` is a positive integer (\(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\)), adding 1 to `n` will always result in a value greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the condition `1 \leq n + 1` is always true for any valid `n`.

Given that the condition `1 * 1 <= n + 1` is always true for the given range of `n`, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `i` is 1**
