State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `qi` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for qi in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate from `0` to `t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate numbers starting from 0 up to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `qi` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(t)` generates values starting from 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be greater than 0 and `qi` is 0.
