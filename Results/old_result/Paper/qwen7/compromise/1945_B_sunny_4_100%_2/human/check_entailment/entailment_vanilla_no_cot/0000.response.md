Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has an error in its logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched at different intervals.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. We then need to determine how many fireworks can be seen during this interval and add the additional fireworks launched within the same period but not overlapping with the LCM interval.

Here's the corrected approach:

1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched within one LCM interval.
3. Calculate the number of such intervals within the visibility period `m`.
4. Adjust for any additional fireworks launched outside these intervals but still within the visibility period.

The corrected code would look something like this:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Number of fireworks launched in one LCM interval
        fireworks_in_lcm = lcm_ab // a + lcm_ab // b - 1
        # Number of full LCM intervals within m
        full_intervals = m // lcm_ab
        # Remaining time after full intervals
        remaining_time = m % lcm_ab
        # Fireworks launched in the remaining time
        additional_fireworks = min(remaining_time // a, remaining_time // b)
        # Total fireworks
        total_fireworks = fireworks_in_lcm * full_intervals + additional_fireworks
        print(total_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected code should provide the right answer for the given problem.
