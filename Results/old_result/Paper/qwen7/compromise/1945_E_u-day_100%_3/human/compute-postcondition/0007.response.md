Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is -1; `st` is an empty set.**

The code creates an empty set named `st`, which was not previously defined. All other variables (`low`, `high`, and `pos`) retain their initial states.
