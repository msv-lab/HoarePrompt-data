Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `u`. For the loop to execute again, `u` must be non-zero (i.e., `u` must be true).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `u` is 0.
   - `c` is the result of the first return from `r()`.
   - `d` is the result of the second return from `r()`.

3. **Loop behavior**: The loop does nothing if `c` is less than `d`. The loop also does nothing if `c` is greater than or equal to `d`. Therefore, the value of `c` and `d` do not affect whether the loop continues to execute.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: Since the loop condition is `u`, and `u` is currently 0, we need to change `u` to a non-zero value (true) for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `u`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`u` must be non-zero (true)**
