Output State: **`u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1; `c` is the first return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`**.

Explanation: The code `c, d = r()` assigns the return values of the function `r()` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the initial state of `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `u` remains unchanged. The values of `c` and `d` are set to the return values of the function `r()`.
