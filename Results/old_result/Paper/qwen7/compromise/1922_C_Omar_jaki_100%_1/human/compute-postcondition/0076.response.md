The loop condition is `u`, which is a boolean expression. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` must be `True`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `u` is falsy. This means `u` could be either `False` or `None` (or any other falsy value). To make the loop execute again, `u` needs to be set to `True`.

The only variable in the loop head is `u`, so we can only adjust that one.

State: **`u` must be True, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`**
