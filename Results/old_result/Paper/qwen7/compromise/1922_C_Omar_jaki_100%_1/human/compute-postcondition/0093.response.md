Output State: **`u` is False, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`, `t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0], `b` is a list containing [0, 0, 0, 0], `v` is `y - x`, `v` is `y - x**.

Explanation: The code `v = y - x` assigns the value of `y - x` to `v`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `u`, `c`, `d`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states.
