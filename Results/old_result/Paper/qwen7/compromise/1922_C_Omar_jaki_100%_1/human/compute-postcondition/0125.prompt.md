Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a tuple of integers returned by the lambda function `r()`.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `b` is a list with its length equal to the length of `a` plus one, starting with the initial value of -1000000000.0, followed by a series of values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()` regardless of the condition since both if and else parts result in the same state of `b`, `c`, and `d`; `u` is False.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, and `u` is set to `False` because `u` is decremented each time through the loop until it reaches `0`. The values of `c` and `d` continue to be updated by calls to `r()`, but these updates do not affect the final state of `b` as described in the given conditions. Therefore, the list `b` retains its structure and values based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with the initial value of `-1000000000.0`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `u` is False, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `u` becomes False because it is decremented until it reaches zero. The values of `c` and `d` are set to the return values of the function `r()` called in the last iteration of the loop, but no further changes occur to these variables once the loop ends. All other variables from the initial state (such as `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `v`, `b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body or head.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: u is a non-zero value decreased by 3 and must be greater than 0, c is the first return value of r(), d is the second return value of r(). If c is less than d, then no change is made to u. Otherwise, no change is made to u as well.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
