Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a list with its length equal to the length of `a` plus one, starting with the initial value of -1000000000.0, followed by a series of values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `u` is a value returned from `r()`
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` is a list with its length equal to the length of `a` plus one, starting with the initial value of -1000000000.0, followed by a series of values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `c` is the value returned by `r()`, `d` is the value returned by `r()`, and `u` is a value that is 1 less than the original value returned from `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, `c` remains lower than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `b` is a list with its length equal to the length of `a` plus one, starting with the initial value of -1000000000.0, followed by a series of values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, `u` is False, regardless of whether `c` is less than `d` or not.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `b` is a list with its length equal to the length of `a` plus one, starting with the initial value of -1000000000.0, followed by a series of values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()` regardless of the condition since both if and else parts result in the same state of `b`, `c`, and `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
