Output State: **`w` is the last element in `a`, `x` is the second last element in `a`, `y` is the third last element in `a`, `z` is the fourth last element in `a`, `v` is `y - x`, `b` is `[6000000000.0, 3000000000.0, 6000000000.0, 9000000000.0, 12000000000.0]`, `u` is falsy.**

Explanation: The variable `u` is decremented by 1. Since `u` was initially truthy (as per the precondition), after decrementing by 1, it becomes falsy. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
