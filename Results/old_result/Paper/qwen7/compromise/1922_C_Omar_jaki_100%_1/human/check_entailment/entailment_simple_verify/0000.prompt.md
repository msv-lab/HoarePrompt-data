You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `u` is False, `c` is the return value of `r()` from the last iteration, `d` is the second return value of `r()` from the last iteration, `b` is a list with its length equal to the length of `a` plus one, starting with the initial value of `-1000000000.0`, followed by a series of values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a` after all iterations of the loop have been executed.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `u` becomes `False` because it is decremented until it reaches zero. The values of `c` and `d` are set to the return values of the function `r()` called in the last iteration of the loop, and these values do not change further. The list `b` retains its structure and values based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with the initial value of `-1000000000.0`, after all iterations of the loop have been executed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses a lambda function `r` to read input and processes the data in a way that does not align with the problem description. The logic inside the main function is complex and does not seem to correctly calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

### Example Input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

### Program Output:
The program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city and calculating the minimum cost. The provided solution seems to involve unnecessary complexity and does not handle the problem as described.

For instance, the program calculates some values in `b` using `zip` and arithmetic operations that do not reflect the logic needed to solve the problem. It also incorrectly handles the calculation of distances and does not properly account for the unique closest city property mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
