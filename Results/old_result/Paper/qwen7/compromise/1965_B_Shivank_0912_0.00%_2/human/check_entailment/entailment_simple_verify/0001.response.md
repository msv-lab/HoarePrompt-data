### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this data to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the pairs of integers (`n` and `k`) for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Generating Sequences**:
   - The function `func_1` generates a fixed sequence of length 25, where each element is a power of 2 (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24]`).
   - This sequence is used for every test case, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
     - If `k` is odd, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24]` cannot form `k` as a sum of distinct powers of 2 because the sum of any subset of these powers will either be even or include `1` (making it odd but not exactly `k`).
     - However, if `k` is even, the sequence can still form `k` as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (e.g., `2 + 4 + ... + 2^(m-1)` where `2^m = k`).
   - **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
     - Given the nature of powers of 2, any positive integer can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Therefore, the sequence can form all sums from 1 to `n-1` (since `k` is excluded).
     - However, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24]` has only 25 elements, which means it can represent sums up to `2^24 - 1 = 16777215`. If `n > 16777215`, the sequence cannot generate all sums from 1 to `n-1`.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence (25) and the sequence itself for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem statement for small values of `n` (up to 16777215), but it fails to meet the requirements for larger values of `n` (greater than 16777215). Specifically, the sequence generated by the program cannot cover all sums from 1 to `n-1` if `n` exceeds 16777215.

### Correctness:
**False**
