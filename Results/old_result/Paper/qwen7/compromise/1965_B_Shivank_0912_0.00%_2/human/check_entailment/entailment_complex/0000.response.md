### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires constructing a sequence \(a\) of non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence of \(a\) sums to \(k\).
   - For every integer \(v\) in the range \(1 \leq v \leq n\) where \(v \neq k\), there exists a subsequence of \(a\) that sums to \(v\).

2. **Solution Approach**: The provided code uses a fixed sequence of the first 25 powers of 2: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\). This approach works because:
   - Any integer \(v\) in the range \(1 \leq v \leq n\) can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (this is the basis of binary representation).
   - Since \(k\) is excluded, no subsequence can sum to \(k\) because \(k\) itself is not included in the sequence.

3. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `cases` (a list of tuples \((n, k)\)).
   - It generates a fixed sequence of 25 powers of 2 and appends it to the results list for each test case.
   - The function returns a list of tuples, each containing the length 25 and the fixed sequence of powers of 2.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: for each test case, it prints the length of the sequence (25) followed by the sequence itself.
   - The sequence ensures that all integers from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) can be formed as a subsequence sum, while no subsequence sums to \(k\).

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly addresses the problem constraints and produces valid outputs for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
