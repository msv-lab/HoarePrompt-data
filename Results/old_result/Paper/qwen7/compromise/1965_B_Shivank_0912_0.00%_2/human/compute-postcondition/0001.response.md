Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `results` is an empty list, `sequence` is a list containing the first 25 powers of 2 starting from 2^0.**

Explanation: The code creates a list called `sequence` which contains the first 25 powers of 2, starting from \(2^0\) (which is 1). This list does not affect the values of `t`, `cases`, or `results`. Therefore, those variables retain their initial states.
