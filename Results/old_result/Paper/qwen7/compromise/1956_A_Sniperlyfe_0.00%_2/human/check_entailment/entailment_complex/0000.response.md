Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the process of removing players from the game according to the indices specified in the list `p`. It iteratively reduces the number of players `n` by the count of players at positions specified in `p` until `n` is less than the smallest index in `p`.
   - The function correctly returns 0 once no more players can be removed, which aligns with the problem's requirement to find the number of players remaining after all possible removals.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases. It reads the necessary inputs for each test case, including `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
   - It then applies `func_1` to each value in `qs` for the given `p` and collects the results in a list `res`.
   - The function prints the results for each test case as required, ensuring that the output matches the expected format.

Given the analysis above, both functions correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
