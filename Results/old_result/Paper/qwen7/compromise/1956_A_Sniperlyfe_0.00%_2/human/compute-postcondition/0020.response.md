Output State: **`k` is the first integer input from the user, `q` is the second integer input from the user, `t` must be greater than 1, `k` and `q` are integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is now a list of integers obtained from the map function, `res` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `res`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `k`, `q`, `t`, `k` and `q` being integers, `p` being a list of integers, and `qs` being a list of integers, while adding that `res` is now an empty list.
