Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `n` is the first element of `qs`, and `qs` is a list of integers, the value of `n` remains unchanged. The list `res` is initialized (if not already) and now contains one element, which is the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)`.
