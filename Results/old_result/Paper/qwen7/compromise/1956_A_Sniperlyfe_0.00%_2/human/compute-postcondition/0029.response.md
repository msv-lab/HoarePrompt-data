To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `res` contains the return value of `func_1(res[0], p)` appended to its previous contents.
   - `n` is the next value from `qs`.
   - `qs` has one less value remaining.
   - `res` is updated by appending the return value of `func_1(n, p)` to itself.

2. **Operations**:
   - The `res` list is updated twice: once with `func_1(res[0], p)` and once with `func_1(n, p)`.
   - After both updates, `res` will contain three elements: `func_1(res[0], p)`, followed by `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement uses `' '.join(map(str, res))` to join the elements of `res` into a single string, separated by spaces, and converts each element to a string.

Given this breakdown, the `res` list will have the following structure after both updates:
- First element: `func_1(res[0], p)`
- Second element: `func_1(n, p)`
- Third element: `func_1(n, p)` (since `n` is the next value from `qs` and `qs` has one less value remaining)

Therefore, the `print` statement will output these elements joined by spaces.

Output: **func_1(res[0], p) func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p)**
