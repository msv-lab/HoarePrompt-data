Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: 
   - `qs` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
   - `n` is the second element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list with two elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: 
   - The loop iterates over each element in `qs`.
   - For the next iteration, `n` will be the next element in the list `qs`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `n` is the second element of `qs` initially, after the first iteration, `n` will be set to the third element of `qs`.
   - `qs` remains the same list, but `n` changes to the next element.
   - `res` is not part of the loop head and its value does not change based on the loop itself; it is determined by `func_1(n, p)` for the current `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `n` (which is now the third element of `qs`) and keep `qs` unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`qs` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` is a list with two elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
