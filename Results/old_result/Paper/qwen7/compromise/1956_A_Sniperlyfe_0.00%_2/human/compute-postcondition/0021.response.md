Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for n in qs:`. The objects involved here are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `n`: This variable will take on values from the list `qs` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `qs`: This is a list of integers obtained from applying the `map` function to a list of strings.

3. **Understand the initial state given**:
   - `k` is the first integer input from the user.
   - `q` is the second integer input from the user.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `k` and `q` are integers.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `qs` is now a list of integers obtained from the map function.
   - `res` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `qs` must contain at least one element. Since `qs` is derived from the `map` function applied to a list of integers, it will contain elements if the input string provided to the `map` function is non-empty and contains integers.
   - The value of `n` will be taken from `qs` during each iteration, so we don't need to adjust its initial state directly; we just need to ensure `qs` has at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `qs` having at least one element.

**State:**
**`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
