Output State: **`res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the next element of `qs`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `res` initially contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`, after appending, `res` will contain the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
