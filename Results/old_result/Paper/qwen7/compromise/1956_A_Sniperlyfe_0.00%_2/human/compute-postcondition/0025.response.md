Output State: **`res` now contains the return value of `func_1(res[0], p)` appended to its previous contents, `n` is the next value from `qs`, and `qs` must still have at least one value remaining.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `n` is the next value from `qs`, and `qs` must still have at least one value remaining, `n` is updated to the next value in `qs`. The variable `p` remains unchanged, and the previous state of `res` is maintained except for the appended value.
