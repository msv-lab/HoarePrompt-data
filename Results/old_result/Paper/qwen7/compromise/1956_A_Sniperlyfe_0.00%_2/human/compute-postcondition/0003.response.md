Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `p`. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged, and `q` is also unchanged.
