Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) are not yet affected.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, adhering to the constraint that `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain undefined until further input or assignments occur.
