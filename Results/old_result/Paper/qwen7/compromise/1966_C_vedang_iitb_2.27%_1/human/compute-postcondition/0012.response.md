Postcondition: `a` is a list of n non-negative integers, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and n is not equal to 2; `winNext` is the result of calling `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. Additionally, `winNext` is neither 2 nor 1 when `a[0]` equals 1, and `winNext` is 1 when `a[0]` is not 1.
