Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and an integer `n` indicating the number of piles (with 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). Depending on certain conditions, the function returns either 1 or 2.**

Given the multiple return cases without detailed conditions, it's clear that the function evaluates some criteria related to the list `a` and returns either 1 or 2 based on those evaluations.
