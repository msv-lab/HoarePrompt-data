Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones.
   - Players take turns removing a positive integer `k` (at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile) from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - We need to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of the sizes of the piles).
   - A position is a winning position if the Nim-sum is non-zero; otherwise, it is a losing position.

3. **Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a)**: This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and computes a modified list `a_new`. However, this function does not seem to be directly related to solving the game.
   - **func_2(a, n)**: This function attempts to determine the winner based on the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `a`.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - **Base Cases**:
     - For `n == 1`, the function returns 1, indicating Alice wins.
     - For `n == 2`, the function checks if the first pile is even. If so, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - The function recursively calls itself with `a[1:]` and `n - 1`.
     - It checks if the opponent (`winNext`) can force a win or if Alice can force a win by ensuring the Nim-sum is non-zero.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The base cases handle simple scenarios correctly.
   - The recursive case needs to ensure that the Nim-sum logic is applied correctly. However, the current implementation does not use the Nim-sum directly and instead relies on a recursive check, which may not always be optimal.

### Conclusion

The provided functions do not correctly implement the Nim-sum logic, which is essential for determining the winner in this game. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
