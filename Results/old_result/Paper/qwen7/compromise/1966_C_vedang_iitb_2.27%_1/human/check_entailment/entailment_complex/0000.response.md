### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones, and players take turns removing a fixed number of stones from each non-empty pile simultaneously.
   - The player who cannot make a move (when all piles are empty) loses.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles and the initial configuration of stones.
   - If the number of piles is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by playing optimally.
   - If the number of piles is even, the second player (Bob) can always force a win by playing optimally.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function processes the input list `a` by removing duplicates, sorting it, and then calculating differences between consecutive elements. However, this transformation does not affect the game's outcome directly.
   - **func_2**: This function determines the winner based on the number of piles (`n`) and the initial configuration of stones (`a`). It uses recursion to simulate the game's outcome for smaller subproblems.

4. **Function 2 Logic**:
   - For `n == 1`, Alice wins because she can remove all stones in one move.
   - For `n == 2`, Alice wins if the number of stones in the first pile is even, otherwise Bob wins.
   - For `n > 2`, the function recursively checks the subproblem with one less pile. If the next player can force a win, the current player can also force a win unless the first pile has more than one stone, in which case the next player can lose.

5. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program processes each test case, calls `func_1` to transform the input list (though this transformation is not used), and then calls `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the strategy for determining the winner based on the number of piles and the initial configuration.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of piles and the initial configuration of stones. The transformations in `func_1` do not affect the outcome, but the recursive logic in `func_2` accurately simulates the game's optimal play.

### Correctness:
**True**
