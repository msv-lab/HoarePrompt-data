The function accepts two parameters: `n`, representing half the number of cards, and `a`, a list of integers from 1 to `n` (each appearing at most twice). It calculates the minimum value between the number of pairs (integers appearing exactly twice) in the list `a` and half the number of cards (`n`). The function returns this minimum value.
