Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings starting from the second element, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, and `a` is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of the first element in the list `data` (since `idx` is 0) to the variable `t`. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented to 1 to point to the next element in the list `data`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
