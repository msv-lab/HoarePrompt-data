Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings starting from the second element, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, and `a` is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `idx`, `t`, `data`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
