Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding an array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\). Given the constraints, we need to ensure that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution initializes `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
   - It then iterates backward through the array, updating `ans[i]` to \(ans[i+1] - x_i\). This approach ensures that the modulo condition is met for each \(x_i\).

3. **Verification**:
   - The initialization of `ans` with \(10^9\) ensures that the initial values are large enough to satisfy the modulo operation.
   - The backward iteration ensures that each `ans[i]` is adjusted based on the previous value and the current \(x_i\), ensuring the modulo condition holds.
   - The final state of `ans` correctly reflects the required values based on the input `arr`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where the last element of `ans` remains unchanged because there is no corresponding \(x_i\) to adjust it.
   - The solution also ensures that all elements are within the required bounds.

Given this analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find an array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
