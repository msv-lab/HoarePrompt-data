You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are calculated using the formula `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged. All elements except the first `n-1` are set to \(10^9\), and the variable `i` is set to `-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Let's consider a test case to demonstrate this:

For the input:
```
3
2 1
```
The expected output is an array `a` such that:
- \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \bmod a_1 = 1\)

However, the current implementation sets `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which does not guarantee that the modulo condition will be met. For instance, if we set `a_1 = 3`, then `a_2` would need to be such that `3 \bmod a_2 = 1`. A valid choice could be `a_2 = 2`, but the current logic does not ensure this.

A correct approach would involve setting `a_i` such that the modulo condition is satisfied. One way to do this is to set `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    ans[0] = 10 ** 9  # Initialize the first element arbitrarily large
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This corrected version ensures that the modulo condition is met for each `x_i`. For the given test case, the output would be:
```
3 3 2
```
which satisfies the conditions:
- \(3 \bmod 3 = 0\) (not exactly matching the requirement, but the logic needs to be adjusted to fit the exact requirement)
- \(3 \bmod 2 = 1\)

However, the original implementation fails to meet the requirement in general, hence the correctness is **False**.
