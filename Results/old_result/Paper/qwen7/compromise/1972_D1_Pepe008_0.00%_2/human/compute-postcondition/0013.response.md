Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `b + 1` (inclusive). The loop condition is based on the variable `i`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `T` must be greater than 0.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` is `int(info[1])` and must be at least 1.
   - `suma` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `(a - i * (i - 1))` is greater than 0.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be `3` (because the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be within the range `1` to `b + 1`. Therefore, `3` must be within this range, meaning `b` must be at least 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - `b` must be at least `3`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `T` must still be greater than 0.
   - `t` remains `0`.
   - `a` remains `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` must be at least `3`.
   - `i` is now `3`.
   - `(a - i * (i - 1))` must be greater than 0, which translates to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1))` being greater than 0 or `(a - 6)` being greater than 0.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, and `(a - 6)` is greater than 0.**
