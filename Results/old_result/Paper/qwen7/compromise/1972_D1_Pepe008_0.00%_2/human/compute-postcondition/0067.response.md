Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 3`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is \((a - (a + 3) \cdot (a + 3 - 1)) // (a + 3)\), `x` is \((a - (a + 3) \cdot (a + 2)) // (a + 3)\), `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `x` is \((a - (a + 3) \cdot (a + 2)) // (a + 3) + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` as \((a - (a + 3) \cdot (a + 2)) // (a + 3) + 1\). This expression simplifies to \((-3 \cdot (a + 2)) // (a + 3) + 1\), which further simplifies to \(-3 + 1 = -2\) since \((-3 \cdot (a + 2)) // (a + 3)\) results in \(-3\) when \(a\) is an integer. Therefore, `x` is \(-2 + 1 = -1\). Since `x` is negative, it does not add to `suma`. All other variables remain as described in the initial state.
