Output State: **The loop will continue executing until `i` exceeds `b`. After all iterations, `t` remains 0, `T` remains greater than 0, `a` remains `int(info[0])`, and `b` remains its initial value. The variable `suma` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. `i` will be `b + 1` after the loop completes.**

In more detail, the final state will be:
- `t` remains 0.
- `T` remains greater than 0.
- `a` remains as the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` remains its initial value.
- `suma` is the cumulative sum of `x` values, where each `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for each valid `i` from 1 to `b`, but only if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
- `i` is `b + 1` since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `b` and stops.
- `x` is not a persistent variable and does not retain any value outside the loop.
