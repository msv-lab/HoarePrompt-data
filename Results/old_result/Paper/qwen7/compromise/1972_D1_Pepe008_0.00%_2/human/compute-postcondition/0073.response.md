Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be equal to `T`, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been completed. The variable `suma` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values calculated for each valid `i` in the range from 1 to `b` across all iterations of the loop. `i` will be `a + b` since it increments with each iteration of the inner loop. `a` will be the last value of `a` from the last iteration of the loop, and `b` will be the last value of `b` from the last iteration of the loop. The value of `suma` will be the total sum of all `x` values calculated during the entire execution of the loop, adjusted by subtracting 1 at the end of each iteration.
