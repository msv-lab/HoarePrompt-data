Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a`, `suma` is the sum of `x` for each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is converted to an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is converted to an integer from the second element of `info`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to integers from the first and second elements of the `info` list respectively. All other variables retain their original conditions and relationships.
