Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The code calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression simplifies to `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `a // 1 + 1`, resulting in `a + 1`. Since `a` is `int(info[0])`, `x` is therefore `int(info[0]) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
