Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m` (renamed as `a` and `b` in the code).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The nested loops iterate over possible values of `i` from 1 to `b`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` ensures that the division operation is valid and avoids division by zero or negative numbers.
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` seems to be derived from the problem's constraints and conditions.

4. **Output**:
   - The final result `suma - 1` is printed for each test case.

5. **Guarantees**:
   - The code handles the constraints and guarantees specified in the problem statement, such as the limits on `n`, `m`, and `T`.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The provided example outputs match the expected results, and the code adheres to the problem's constraints.

Correctness: **True**
