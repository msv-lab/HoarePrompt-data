Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition `a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]` is not met, the values of `match_a_b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
