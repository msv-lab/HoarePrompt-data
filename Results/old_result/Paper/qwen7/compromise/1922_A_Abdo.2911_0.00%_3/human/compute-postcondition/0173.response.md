Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_a_b`, `i`, or `n`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and the only additional information is that we have exited the loop or conditional block.
