Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `match_c` is either False (if the character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at the same index in `template`), or `match_c` is True (if the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` after converting both to lowercase).
