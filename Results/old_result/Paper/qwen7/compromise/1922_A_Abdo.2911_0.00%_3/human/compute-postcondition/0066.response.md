Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the state of `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
