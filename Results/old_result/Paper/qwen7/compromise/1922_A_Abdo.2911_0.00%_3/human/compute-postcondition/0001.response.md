Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. This means that `t` is an integer value input by the user.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
