Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All characters in `template` are either unchanged or converted to uppercase, `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If the character at position `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at the same position in `template`, then `match_c` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, if the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase, `match_c` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase and the corresponding character in `c` matches after conversion to lowercase, then `match_c` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1. `match_c` is False. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or if `c[i].lower()` does not equal `template[i].lower()`, the condition remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `match_c` is False. If `c[2].lower()` is equal to `template[2].lower()`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, the values of `n`, `i`, and `match_c` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
