Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase. The current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` after converting both to lowercase; `match_c` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement we were inside. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `template`, `c`, and `match_c` remain unchanged as no assignment or modification was made within the `break` statement itself.
