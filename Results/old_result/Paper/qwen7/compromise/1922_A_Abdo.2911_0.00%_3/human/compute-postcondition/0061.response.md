Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `match_a_b` is False.**

The code sets `match_a_b` to `False`. Since `i` and `n` were part of the initial state and no operations were performed on them, their values remain unchanged. The only change is that `match_a_b` is now explicitly set to `False`.
