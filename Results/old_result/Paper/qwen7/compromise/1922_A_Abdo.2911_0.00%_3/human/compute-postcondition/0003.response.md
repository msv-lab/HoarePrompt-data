Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user and strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it. The value of `t` and `n` remains unchanged from their initial state.
