Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is either True or False; `match_c` is True; `i` equals `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, `i` equals `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter if and only if the character at index `i` in `c` (converted to lowercase) matches the current value of `template[i]` (also converted to lowercase). If they do not match, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, no change occurs to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, and `i` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 0. If `template[i].islower()` is true and `c[i] != template[i]`, `i` is set to the next index where the condition is not met or breaks out of the loop. If the condition `c[i] != template[i]` is false, `i` is still incremented by 1. If the else part is executed, `i` is reset to 0, and if `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, and `i` is either `i + 1` or 0. If `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
