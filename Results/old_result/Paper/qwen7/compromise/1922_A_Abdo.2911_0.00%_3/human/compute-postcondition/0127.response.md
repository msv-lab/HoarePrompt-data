Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is added to the `template` list.**

Explanation: The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the `template` list. Given the initial state where `i` is `n` (and `n` is greater than 0), after the code executes, `i` will be decremented by 1 (since `i` was at its maximum value `n` and now it's being used in an append operation which doesn't change its value but the context implies it's post-decrement). The condition that the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]` remains unchanged as no operations affect `a` or `b`.
