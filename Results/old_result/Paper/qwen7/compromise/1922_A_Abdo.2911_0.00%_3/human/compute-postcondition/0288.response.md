Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `match_a_b` is False.**

The code sets `match_a_b` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being incremented by 1, `n` remaining the same, and `match_a_b` being set to `False`.
