Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `match_c` is either True or False, `c` is the stripped input string from user, `template` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `template`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `match_c`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
