Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either lowercase or not lowercase; if `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, no change occurs to `match_a_b`.
