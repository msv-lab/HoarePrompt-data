Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, `i` equals `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `c` is the stripped input string from user, `template` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, and the `template` string contains either the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`) or the uppercase version of the element at index `i` of list `a` (if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be less than `n`, and `template` now contains either the element `a[i]` if it matches `b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if it does not match.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `template` now contains either the element `a[i]` if it matches `b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if it does not match.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
