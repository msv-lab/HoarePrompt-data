Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n - 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The `template` string contains either the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`) or the uppercase version of the element at index `i` of list `a` (if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `n` remains the same as it did not change during the loop iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Since `n` must be greater than 0 and the condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the next iteration.

**Final State**:
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` must be less than `n` (i.e., `i + 1 < n`).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than `n`**.
