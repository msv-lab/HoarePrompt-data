Postcondition: `template[i]` is a character, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter. If either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (when converted to lowercase) matches the lowercase version of `template[i]`, then the condition `match_a_b` remains `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches `template[i]` when converted to lowercase, the condition and break statement do not change.
