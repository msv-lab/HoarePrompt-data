Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `template` has the value `a[i].upper()` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i].upper()` to the list `template`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` remain unchanged. The new state of `template` includes the uppercased version of `a[i]`.
