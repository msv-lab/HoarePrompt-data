Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase character. If the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` after converting both to lowercase, then `match_c` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, and `match_c` remain unchanged.
