Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `match_c` to `False`. Since `match_a_b` was either `True` or `False`, its state remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `n` also remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
