Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `match_a_b` is either unchanged or becomes True. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` becomes True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` remains False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
