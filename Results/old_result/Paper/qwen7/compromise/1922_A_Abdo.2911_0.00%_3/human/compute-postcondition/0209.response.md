Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, and `i` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 0. If `template[i].islower()` is true, `i` is incremented by 1 and checked against `c[i] != template[i]`. If the condition is true, `i` is set to the next index where the condition is not met or the loop breaks. If the condition is false, `i` is still incremented by 1. If `template[i].islower()` is false, `i` is reset to 0 and the condition `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` is checked. If the condition is true, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables.
