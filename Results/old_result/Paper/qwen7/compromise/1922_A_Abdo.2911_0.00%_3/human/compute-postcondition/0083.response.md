Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase character. If the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` after converting both to lowercase, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `i`, `n`, or `template[i]`.
