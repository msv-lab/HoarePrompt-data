Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The variable `match_a_b` is explicitly set to `False`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`, but the exact value of `i` before the increment is not specified, so it remains as `i + 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid and unchanged.
