Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings (`n`) and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It constructs a template based on the comparison between `a` and `b`:
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character from `a` to the template.
   - If the characters differ, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template.
4. It then checks if the template matches `a` and `b` under the specified conditions:
   - For `a` and `b`, if the template character is lowercase, it must exactly match the corresponding character in `a` and `b`.
   - If the template character is uppercase, it must not match the corresponding character in `a` and `b` (i.e., the lowercase version).
5. It also checks if the template does not match `c`:
   - If the template character is lowercase, it must not match the corresponding character in `c`.
   - If the template character is uppercase, it must match the corresponding character in `c` (i.e., the lowercase version).
6. Based on these checks, it prints "YES" if the conditions are met, and "NO" otherwise.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
