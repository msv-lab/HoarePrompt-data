#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer representing the length of the string expression such that 1 <= length <= 5000.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is the number of '+' characters in the `expression`.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`, where `sub` is the difference between the length of `expression` and the number of '+' characters in `expression`, and `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of "+" and "-" characters and an integer `length` representing the length of `expression`. It counts the number of "+" characters in `expression`, calculates the difference between `length` and this count, and then returns the absolute value of the difference between this calculated difference and the count of "+" characters.
