### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
   - The penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The provided program only counts the number of '+' and '-' in the string `expression` and calculates a simple difference between the counts.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `expression` and the string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
   - It then calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of `expression` and the count of '+' characters.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually split the array `a` into subarrays.
   - Instead, it simply returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters.
   - This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

4. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the third test case: `--+++++++-`.
     - The function counts 8 '-' and 3 '+' characters.
     - It calculates `sub` as `8 - 3 = 5`.
     - It returns `abs(5 - 3) = 2`.
     - The correct answer should be 0, as the optimal split is `(--, ++++, +, -)`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty.
   - The function `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement the logic to find the optimal splits that minimize the penalty.
