Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `expression`, a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `length`, an integer representing the length of the string `expression`. It calculates the absolute value of the difference between `sub` (the difference between the length of `expression` and the number of '+' characters in `expression`) and `count` (the number of '+' characters in `expression`), and returns this value.**
