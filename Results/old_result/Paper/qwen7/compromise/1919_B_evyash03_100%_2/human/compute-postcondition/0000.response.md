Output State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer representing the length of the string expression such that 1 <= length <= 5000.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `expression` or `length`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `count` is updated to 0.
