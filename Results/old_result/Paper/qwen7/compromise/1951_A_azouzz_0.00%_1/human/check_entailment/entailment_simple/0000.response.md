Reasoning:
The annotated program does not match the original problem description or the initial code snippet. The original code is designed to generate `.py` files from `.html` files within specified folders. However, the annotated program `func_1()` is a completely different function that reads input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. 

Given this mismatch, the annotated program does not reflect the intended behavior of the original code. Therefore, the annotated program cannot be considered correct in the context of the original problem.

Correctness: **False**
