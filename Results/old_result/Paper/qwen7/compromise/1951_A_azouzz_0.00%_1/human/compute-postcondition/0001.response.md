Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 1. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state where `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, and `t` is an input integer, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
