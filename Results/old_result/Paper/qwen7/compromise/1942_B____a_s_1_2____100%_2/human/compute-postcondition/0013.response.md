Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Here, `i` is already defined as `n - 3`, and `mex` and `a[i]` are assumed to be part of the initial state but their specific values are not given. Therefore, `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]` based on the given formula. The conditions and values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
