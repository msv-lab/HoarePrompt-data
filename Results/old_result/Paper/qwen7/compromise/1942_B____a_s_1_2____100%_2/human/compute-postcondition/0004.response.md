Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
