Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `p[0]` is `mex - a[0]`
- `mex` is updated to be the minimum between the old `mex` and `p[0]`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts from `n - 1` and goes down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop has already executed for `i = 0`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 from its current value of 0.
- Therefore, `i` will be `-1` in the next iteration.

### Updated States:
- Since `i` is now `-1`, the loop will stop executing because the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` does not include `-1`.
- No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is -1**
