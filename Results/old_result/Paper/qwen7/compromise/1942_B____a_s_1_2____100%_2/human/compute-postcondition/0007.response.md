Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n-1`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Here, `i` is already defined as `n-1` from the initial state. The values of `n`, `i`, `p`, `mex`, and `a` are updated according to the operation. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
