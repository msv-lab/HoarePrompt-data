Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[0]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. The values of `i`, `mex`, and the list `p` (specifically `p[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid.
