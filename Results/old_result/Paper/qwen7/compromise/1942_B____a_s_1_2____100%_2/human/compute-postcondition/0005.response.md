Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`, `mex` is `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `n`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
