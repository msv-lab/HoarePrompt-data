Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.
- `p[i]` remains `mex - a[i]`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop starts from `n-1` and goes down to `0` (inclusive).
2. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will become `n-2`.

### Adjusting States:
- **Variable `i`**: Since `i` will be decremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n-2`.
- **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

### Updated State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is now `n-2`.
- `mex` and `p[i]` remain unchanged from the previous iteration since they are updated inside the loop body, but their values are not specified to change in the loop head.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n-2`; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`; `p[i]` remains `mex - a[i]`**.
