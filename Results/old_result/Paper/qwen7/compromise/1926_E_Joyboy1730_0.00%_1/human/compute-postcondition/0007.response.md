Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n`.
2. **Current state**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 ⋅ 10^4, inclusive.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `L` is an empty list.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `n` is reduced by `(n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Loop head variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `n`.

4. **Determine the adjustment needed**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is initially greater than 0 and is reduced by `(n + 1) // 2` each iteration, we need to ensure that after the reduction, `n` is still non-zero.

Given that `n` is reduced by `(n + 1) // 2`, let's denote the new value of `n` as `n'`. We need `n' > 0` for the loop to continue.

Since `n' = n - (n + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that this expression results in a positive value. 

To simplify, let's consider the possible values of `n`:
- If `n` is even, say `n = 2a`, then `n' = 2a - (2a + 1) // 2 = 2a - a - 0.5 = a - 0.5`. This would not be an integer, so `n` cannot be even.
- If `n` is odd, say `n = 2a + 1`, then `n' = (2a + 1) - (2a + 2) // 2 = (2a + 1) - (a + 1) = a`. This is always a non-negative integer as long as `a` is non-negative.

Therefore, the loop can continue as long as `n` is odd and greater than 1.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 ⋅ 10^4, inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
