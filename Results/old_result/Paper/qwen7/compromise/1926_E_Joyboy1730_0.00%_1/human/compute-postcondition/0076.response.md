Output State: **`k` is now `k - tot`, `pow` is 2, `m` is 0, `tot` is `tot + a`, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, `n` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` adds the value of `a` to `tot`. The other variables (`k`, `pow`, `m`, `n`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `tot` is the original value of `tot` plus the value of `a`.
