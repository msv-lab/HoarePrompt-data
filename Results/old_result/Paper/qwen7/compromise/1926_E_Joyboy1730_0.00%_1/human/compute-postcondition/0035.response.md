Output State: **`L` must have at least one element, `tot` is increased by `a`, `k` is decreased by `tot`, and `pow` is multiplied by 2.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. The other variables (`L`, `tot`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
