The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints either a line with \( k \) occurrences of \( k \) if \( n \) equals \( k \) and \( k \geq 2 \), or a line with numbers from 1 to \( n \) if \( k < 2 \). If \( n \neq k \) and \( k \geq 2 \), it prints `-1`. The total number of lines printed does not exceed 1000.
