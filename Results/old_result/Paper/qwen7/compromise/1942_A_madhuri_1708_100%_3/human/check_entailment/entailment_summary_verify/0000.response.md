### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- We need to find an array \( a \) of length \( n \) such that exactly \( k \) out of the \( n \) cyclic shifts of \( a \) are sorted.
- The program should output the array \( a \) if it exists, or `-1` if no such array exists.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input from standard input and processes each test case.
2. **Case Handling**:
   - If \( k \geq 2 \):
     - If \( n = k \), the program prints \( k \) occurrences of \( k \).
     - Otherwise, the program prints `-1`.
   - If \( k < 2 \), the program prints numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it prints either:
  - A line with \( k \) occurrences of \( k \) if \( n = k \) and \( k \geq 2 \).
  - A line with numbers from 1 to \( n \) if \( k < 2 \).
  - `-1` if \( n \neq k \) and \( k \geq 2 \).

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Test Case: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)**:
   - The program prints `[2, 2]`, which is correct because both cyclic shifts `[2, 2]` are sorted.
   
2. **Test Case: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program prints `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct because only the first cyclic shift `[1, 2, 3]` is sorted.
   
3. **Test Case: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 2 \)**:
   - The program prints `-1`, but according to the problem description, there exists a valid array `[69420, 69, 420]` that has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.
   - The program fails to handle this case correctly.

4. **Test Case: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)**:
   - The program prints `-1`, but according to the problem description, the array `[1, 1, 1]` is valid because all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - The program fails to handle this case correctly.

5. **Test Case: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 0 \)**:
   - The program prints `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct because no cyclic shift is sorted.

From the above analysis, we can see that the program does not handle all cases correctly. It fails to generate arrays that meet the criteria for certain values of \( n \) and \( k \), particularly when \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \).

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and outputs incorrect results for some valid inputs.

**Final: False**
