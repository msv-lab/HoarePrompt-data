Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. The provided solution attempts to handle different cases:
   - If \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), it prints an array with \(k\) occurrences of \(k\).
     - Otherwise, it prints \(-1\).
   - If \(k < 2\), it prints an array with numbers from 1 to \(n\).

3. Let's analyze the correctness of these approaches:
   - When \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\), the solution prints an array where every element is \(k\). This array has exactly \(k\) cyclic shifts that are sorted because shifting any number of times will still result in the same array.
   - When \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\), the solution correctly prints \(-1\) because it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts for \(n \neq k\).
   - When \(k < 2\), the solution prints an array with numbers from 1 to \(n\). However, this approach doesn't guarantee that exactly \(k\) cyclic shifts will be sorted. For instance, if \(n = 3\) and \(k = 1\), the array \([1, 2, 3]\) has only one sorted cyclic shift (itself), but the array \([2, 3, 1]\) also has one sorted cyclic shift (after one shift).

4. The solution fails to meet the requirement when \(k < 2\) because it doesn't ensure exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect for the case where \(k < 2\). It needs to generate an array that ensures exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts, not just any increasing sequence.
