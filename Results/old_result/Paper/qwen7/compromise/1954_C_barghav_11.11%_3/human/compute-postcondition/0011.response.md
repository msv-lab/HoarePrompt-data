Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the strings x and y represent the same integer when their digits are reversed.**

Given that `x` and `y` are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9, the function does not actually take any parameters but rather seems to compare the reversed versions of these strings. However, based on the provided format and the typical structure of such problems, the description focuses on the expected input and output without detailing the internal operations.
