You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5. The string a consists of n characters where each character is from 'A' to 'G'.

    #State: The value of `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in the dictionary `hmp` where the value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the given solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown
- We have `m` rounds to conduct.
- Each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- We start with `n` problems of various difficulty levels.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure we can conduct `m` rounds.

### Given Solution Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of problems in the bank.
     - `m`: Number of rounds to conduct.
     - `s`: String representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `ans`: Variable to store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - `p`: String containing all possible difficulty levels ('ABCDEFG').

3. **Counting Problems:**
   - `hmp`: Counter object that counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `s`.

4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G':
     - If the difficulty level is not present in `hmp`, it means no such problem exists in the bank. Therefore, we need `m` problems of this type.
     - If the difficulty level is present but the count is less than `m`, we need `m - hmp[i]` additional problems of this type.

5. **Output:**
   - Print the total number of additional problems needed for the current test case.

### Reasoning
- The logic correctly identifies the gaps between the required number of problems and the available ones.
- It handles all edge cases, including when certain difficulty levels are missing entirely.
- The approach ensures that the minimum number of additional problems is calculated accurately.

### Example Walkthrough
- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `s = "BGECDCBDED"`
  - Required difficulties: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'
  - Available: 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'C', 'B'
  - Missing: 'A', 'F'
  - Additional problems needed: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `s = "BGECDCBDED"`
  - Required difficulties: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G' for both rounds
  - Available: 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'C', 'B'
  - Missing: 'A', 'F' for each round
  - Additional problems needed: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `s = "BBCDEFFGG"`
  - Required difficulties: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'
  - Available: 'B', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'G'
  - Missing: 'A'
  - Additional problems needed: `1`

### Conclusion
The given solution correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided requirements and constraints.
