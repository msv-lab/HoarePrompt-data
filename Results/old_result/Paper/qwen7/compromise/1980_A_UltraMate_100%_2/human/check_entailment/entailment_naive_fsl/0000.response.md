Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round has at least one problem of each difficulty level. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that once a required difficulty level is met for a round, it does not need to be repeated in subsequent rounds. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
7 2
ABCDEFED
5 2
ABCDE
6 2
ABCDEF
```

- For the first test case, the program calculates that 4 additional problems are needed, but only 2 are actually required since 'A' and 'E' are already present in sufficient quantity for both rounds.
- For the second test case, the program calculates that 3 additional problems are needed, but only 1 is actually required since 'A' is already present in sufficient quantity for both rounds.
- For the third test case, the program calculates that 1 additional problem is needed, which is correct.

The program fails to correctly handle cases where certain difficulty levels are already available in sufficient quantity for all rounds, leading to an overestimation of the number of additional problems needed.
