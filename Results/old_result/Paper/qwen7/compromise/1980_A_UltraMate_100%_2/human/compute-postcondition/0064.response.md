Postcondition: `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`, `hmp` retains its state from the last iteration, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and `m`, `n`, `t`, `s` retain their states from the last iteration. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
