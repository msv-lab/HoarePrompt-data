Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `s` is a string input by the user, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s`**.

The code `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a `Counter` object named `hmp` which counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
