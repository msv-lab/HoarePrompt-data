Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEFG'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The value of `ans` will be `m * len(p)`, assuming all characters in `p` ('ABCDEFG') are not in `hmp`. The variable `p` remains unchanged as 'ABCDEFG', and all other variables (`i`, `m`, `n`, `t`, `s`, `hmp`) maintain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `ans` will hold the total increment it received, which is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for every key `i` in the dictionary `hmp` where the value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. If there are no such keys, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
