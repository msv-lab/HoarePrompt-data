Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in p`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `i` is the next element in `p` (not `'A'`), and `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m`, assuming `i` is not in `hmp`. If `i` is in `hmp`, the postcondition does not change from the precondition.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since `i` is the next element in `p` and it is not `'A'`, `i` will be the next element in `p` after the current one.
   - **Variable `ans`**: `ans` is updated by adding `m` to its previous value if `i` is not in `hmp`.
   - **Variable `p`**: `p` remains unchanged as it is the iterable in the loop.

Given these points, we need to update the state of `i` and `ans` for the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `p` (not `'A'`).
   - `ans` will be the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m`, assuming `i` is not in `hmp`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `p` (not `'A'`), `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m`, assuming `i` is not in `hmp`.**
