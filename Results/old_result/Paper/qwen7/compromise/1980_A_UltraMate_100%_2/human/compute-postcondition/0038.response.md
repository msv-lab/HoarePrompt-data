Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0`, `s` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. This input does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `ans`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `s` is assigned the value of the input string.
