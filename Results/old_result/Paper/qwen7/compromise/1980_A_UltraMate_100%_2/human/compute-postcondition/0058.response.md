Postcondition: **`i` is the first key in `hmp`, `hmp` must have at least one key, `ans` is initialized or updated such that it will be `m * len(p)` after the loop, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `m`, `n`, `t`, `s`, and `hmp` retain their states from the last iteration of the loop, and the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
