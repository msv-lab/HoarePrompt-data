Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This means `n` and `m` now hold specific integer values obtained from the input, while `ans` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions and operations involving `ans` and `t` (like `t` being decremented if `t > 0`) are still valid but have not been altered by the current line of code.
