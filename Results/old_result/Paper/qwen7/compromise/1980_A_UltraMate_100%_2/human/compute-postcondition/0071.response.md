Based on the initial state provided:

- `p` is a string 'ABCDEFG'.
- `hmp` is a hashmap (or dictionary) that does not contain any of the characters in `p` ('ABCDEFG').
- `m` is a value that will be used to calculate `ans`.
- `ans` is calculated as `m * len(p)`, where `len(p)` is the length of the string `p`.

Given that `p` is 'ABCDEFG', the length of `p` is 7. Therefore, `ans` will be `m * 7`.

Since the exact value of `m` is not specified, we will keep it as `m`.

Output: **m * 7**
