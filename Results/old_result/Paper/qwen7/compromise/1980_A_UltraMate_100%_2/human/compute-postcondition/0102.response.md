Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in hmp`. This means the variable `i` is iterating over the elements of `hmp`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `hmp` has at least one element.
   - `i` is the second element of `hmp`.
   - `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` remains the same.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `hmp` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element of `hmp` (which is the third element) will be the value of `i` in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `hmp` must have at least one element. Since `hmp` had at least one element before, it will still have at least one element after the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `hmp` will now have its third element as `i`.
   - `ans` will remain the same unless the third element of `hmp` is less than `m`, in which case it would be updated.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `hmp` has at least one element.
- `i` is the third element of `hmp`.
- `ans` remains the same unless the third element of `hmp` is less than `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`hmp` has at least one element, `i` is the third element of `hmp`, and `ans` remains the same unless the third element of `hmp` is less than `m`**.
