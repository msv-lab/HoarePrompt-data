Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a common placeholder for an unused variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, we only need to focus on `t`.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: The initial state is given as `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. However, we should explicitly state this condition to ensure clarity.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
