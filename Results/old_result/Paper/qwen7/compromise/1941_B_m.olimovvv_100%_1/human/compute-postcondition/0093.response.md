Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and an array a of n integers (where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j). It returns the results based on the specified conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns the appropriate result for each test case.
