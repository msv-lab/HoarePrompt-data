Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it checks if any element in the array is negative or if the operations defined in the loop leave any non-zero elements in the array. If any condition is violated, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function implicitly uses input from standard input and outputs to standard output.**
