Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal if statement we are currently inside. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
