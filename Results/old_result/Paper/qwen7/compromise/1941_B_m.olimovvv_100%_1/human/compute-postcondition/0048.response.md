Output State: **`a` must be at least 3; `i` is incremented by 1; `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of the original `b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by the value of `b[i]`. The other variables (`a` and `i`) are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of the original `b[i]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions and updates only the value of `b[i + 2]` to reflect the subtraction of `b[i]`.
