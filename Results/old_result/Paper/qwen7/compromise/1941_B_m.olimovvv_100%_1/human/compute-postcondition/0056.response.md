Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is incremented by 1, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]` - previously `b[i + 1]` was decreased by twice the value of the original `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by the value of `b[i]`. According to the initial conditions, `b[i + 1]` was decreased by twice the value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` was set to 0. Therefore, after this operation, `b[i + 2]` is further decreased by the value of `b[i]`, which is 0. Hence, the value of `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged from its value after the previous operations.
