Output State: **`b[i + 1]' is decreased by 2 times the value of `b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decrements `b[i + 2]` by the value of `b[i]`. The initial state mentions that `b[i + 1]' is decreased by 2 times the value of `b[i]`, which remains unchanged. The condition that if `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken also remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `b[i + 2]` by `b[i]`.
