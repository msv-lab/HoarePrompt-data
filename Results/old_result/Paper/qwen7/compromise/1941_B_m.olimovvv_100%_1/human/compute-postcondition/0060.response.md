Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is provided as:
   - `a` is less than 3.
   - `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`.
   - `b[i + 2]` is adjusted based on the original values of `b[i]` for all `i`.
   - No 'NO' is printed, hence the final output is 'YES'.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points**:
   - The loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the integer input from the user.
   - The variable `a` is used to control the number of iterations. Each iteration decrements `a` by 1.

4. **Current State Analysis**:
   - Since `a` is less than 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it means `a` was initially set to a value greater than or equal to 3.
   - The loop will continue to run until `a` becomes 0 or negative.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be greater than 0.
   - After this iteration, `a` will be decremented by 1, so it will become `a - 1`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `a`, so we need to adjust its value.
   - Since `a` was less than 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it must have been 2 or 1 (because if it was 0 or negative, the loop would have stopped).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be 2 (if it was 3 initially) or 1 (if it was 2 initially).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is 2**, `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, `b[i + 2]` is adjusted based on the original values of `b[i]` for all `i`, no 'NO' is printed, hence the final output is 'YES'.
