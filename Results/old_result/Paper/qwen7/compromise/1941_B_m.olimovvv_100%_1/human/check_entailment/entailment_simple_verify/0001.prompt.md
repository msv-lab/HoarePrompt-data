You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is less than 3, `b` is a list of integers where all elements are zero, and the final output printed is 'YES'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will be less than 3 because each iteration decrements `a` by 1. All elements in `b` that were accessed and modified will have been processed according to the loop's logic. Since the loop processes all elements and does not encounter a negative value in `b` (which would cause an early break), and given that the operations continue until the end of the list, all elements in `b` will be reduced to 0. As a result, the conditions `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:` will not be met, and the final output will be 'YES'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes a loop to process each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it reads the array `b` into a list.

3. **Checking Negative Values:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `a-3` (since `i` goes up to `a-3`).
   - For each element `b[i]`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative.
     - If `b[i]` is negative, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it's impossible to make all elements zero.
   
4. **Modifying Array Elements:**
   - If `b[i]` is non-negative, it performs the following operations:
     - `b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i+2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (this line is redundant as it sets `b[i]` to 0)
   - These operations mimic the described operation where `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` are updated according to the rules.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are zero.
     - If either is non-zero, it prints 'NO'.
     - If both are zero, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling Negative Values Early:**
   - The program correctly identifies if any value in the array becomes negative during the operations, which would make it impossible to reach all zeros. This part is correct.

2. **Array Modification Logic:**
   - The logic for modifying the array elements seems to follow the problem's constraints. However, we need to ensure that these modifications do not lead to incorrect results.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check ensures that the last two elements are zero, which is necessary but might not be sufficient in some edge cases.

### Edge Cases and Validation

- **Edge Case 1:** If the array can be reduced to all zeros, the program should correctly identify this.
- **Edge Case 2:** If there are initial negative values or the operations cannot reduce the array to all zeros, the program correctly identifies this as well.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, the program appears to handle the problem correctly by ensuring no negative values arise and checking the final state of the array. The logic seems sound and covers the required conditions.
