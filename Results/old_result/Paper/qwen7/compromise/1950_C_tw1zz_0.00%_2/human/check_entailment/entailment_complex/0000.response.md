Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format by mapping each hour to its corresponding 12-hour representation.
2. The function correctly sets the AM/PM indicator based on whether the hour is in the first half (12:00 - 11:59) or the second half (00:00 - 11:59) of the day.
3. The function splits the input string `s` into `h` and `m`, and then processes `h` to convert it to the 12-hour format.
4. The function prints the result in the required format "h1 : m AM/PM".

Given these points, the function appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
