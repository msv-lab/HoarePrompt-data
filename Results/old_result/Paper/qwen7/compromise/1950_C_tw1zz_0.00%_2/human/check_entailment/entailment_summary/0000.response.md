Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. However, there are several issues with the logic used to determine whether the time is in the AM or PM period and how it handles the conversion:

1. **Redundant Code**: The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to handle each possible hour from 00 to 23. This is inefficient and can be simplified.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight**: The program incorrectly handles the hour '00' as '12 PM'. It should be '12 AM'.
3. **Lack of Generalization**: The program does not generalize the logic for converting any hour from 00 to 23. It could be simplified using arithmetic operations.

Here's a more efficient way to implement the conversion:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = int(h) % 12
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        if h1 == 0:
            h1 = 12
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')
```

This version uses modulo arithmetic to determine the 12-hour equivalent and correctly handles the AM/PM switch. It also simplifies the code significantly.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
