Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, and the size of `a` is equal to `mexsize + 1`, `mexsize` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Since `a` must have at least one element and its size was originally equal to `mexsize`, now the size of `a` is equal to `mexsize + 1`.
