Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list with at least one element.
- `mexsize` is incremented by 1 every time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`.
- The final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

Given this information, let's analyze the expression `mexsize % 2 == 0`:

- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- Since `mexsize` is the smallest missing positive integer, it must be a positive integer.
- If `mexsize` is even, the expression `mexsize % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True`.
- If `mexsize` is odd, the expression `mexsize % 2 == 0` evaluates to `False`.

Therefore, the print statement will output either "Alice" or "Bob" based on whether `mexsize` is even or odd.

Output: **Alice if mexsize is even, otherwise Bob**
