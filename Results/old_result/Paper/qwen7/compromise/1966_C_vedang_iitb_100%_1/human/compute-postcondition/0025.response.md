Postcondition: `a` must have at least one element, and `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 every time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. Regardless of whether `mexsize` is greater than or less than or equal to `maxsize`, the overall postcondition remains the same: `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
