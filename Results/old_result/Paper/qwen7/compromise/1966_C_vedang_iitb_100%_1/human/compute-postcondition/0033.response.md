Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for sz in a`. The variables involved here are `sz` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
   - `sz` is the variable used to iterate over each element in the list `a`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `sz` is used to iterate over the elements of `a`, it will take on the values of the elements in `a` during each iteration. However, before the loop starts, we don't know what specific value `sz` will take, but we know it will start iterating from the first element of `a`.
   - The list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must contain at least one element.
- `sz` will take on the value of the first element in `a` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the modified state should be:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `sz` is the first element in the list `a`**.
