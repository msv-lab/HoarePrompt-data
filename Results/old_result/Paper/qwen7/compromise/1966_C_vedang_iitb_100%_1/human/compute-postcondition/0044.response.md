Output State: **`a` is a list containing at least one element (excluding the first element), and `sz` is the third element in the original list `a`; `mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. Since `sz` is the third element in the original list `a`, its value remains unchanged. The value of `a` and the condition that it contains at least one element (excluding the first element) also remain unchanged.
