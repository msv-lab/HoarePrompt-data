Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `mexsize = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `mexsize`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `maxsize`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
