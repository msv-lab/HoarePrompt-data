Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `sz` which iterates over the elements of the list `a`.

2. **Understand the postcondition of the previous iteration**:
   - `mexsize` is incremented by 1.
   - `sz` remains as the second element of the list `a`.
   - `a` is the list `a` excluding its first element.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `sz` is the second element of the list `a` after removing the first element, in the next iteration, `sz` will be the third element of the updated list `a`.
   - The list `a` will now be the list excluding its first two elements (since it was already missing the first element from the previous iteration).

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 again.
   - `sz` will be the third element of the updated list `a`.
   - `a` will be the list `a` excluding its first two elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mexsize` is incremented by 1, `sz` is the third element of the list `a`, `a` is the list `a` excluding its first two elements**.
