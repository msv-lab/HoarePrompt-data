Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `sz` and the variable `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the list `a`.

3. **Postcondition analysis**: The postcondition states that if the size of `a` is equal to `mexsize + 1`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs to `mexsize`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` must have at least one element.
   - If the size of `a` is equal to `mexsize + 1`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, the size of `a` remains the same as it was at the start of the current iteration.
   - Therefore, the size of `a` is still the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - If the size of `a` is equal to `mexsize + 1`, then `mexsize` will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the following:
- The size of `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `mexsize` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` must have at least one element, and `mexsize` is either `mexsize + 1` or remains the same**.
