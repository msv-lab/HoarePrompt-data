Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxsize = max(a)
    a.sort()
    mexsize = 1
    for sz in a:
        if sz == mexsize:
            mexsize = mexsize + 1
    if mexsize > maxsize:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the if-else block executes, `a` must have at least one element, and `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 every time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements processed. `mexsize` is updated to the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. `tc` is incremented by the number of iterations the loop executed, which is equal to the length of the list `a`. `n` remains unchanged, and `t` remains unchanged. `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a` before any elements were potentially incremented within the loop. If the current value of `mexsize` is greater than the current value of `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`; otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements from the list `a` have been iterated over, `sz` is now the last element of the original list `a`, `mexsize` has been incremented for each occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`, `a` is now an empty list, and either `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` or `mexsize` is not incremented for each occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
