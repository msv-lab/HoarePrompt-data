Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The logic in the program does not account for the actual movement of chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros, which does not reflect the actual number of moves needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
```
The program would output `3`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here's how the operations should look:
1. Move the chip in the 4th cell to the 3rd cell.
2. Move the chip in the 7th cell to the 6th cell.

This shows that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
