You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers a (a[i] is either 0 or 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for chip). Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, as it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. `n` will retain its original value since it is not modified within the loop. `a` will be an empty list if all inputs resulted in lists with only zeros or no valid input was provided, otherwise, `a` will contain the remaining non-zero elements from the last input list after removing all leading and trailing zeros. `res` will be the total count of zeros found in all the lists processed during the loop iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the final list `a`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations on all provided inputs.
    #
    #This means that after processing all inputs, `t` will be 0, `n` will be the original input, `a` will be either an empty list or a list of non-zero integers, `res` will be the cumulative count of zeros from all inputs, and `i` will reflect the length of the final list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list `a` of `n` integers (each either 0 or 1). For each test case, it removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. Then, it counts the number of zeros remaining in the list and prints the list followed by the zero count. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final state where `t` is 0, `n` retains its original value, `a` is either empty or contains the remaining non-zero elements, `res` is the total count of zeros from all test cases, and `i` reflects the length of the final list `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The logic in the program does not account for the actual movement of chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros, which does not reflect the actual number of moves needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
```
The program would output `3`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here's how the operations should look:
1. Move the chip in the 4th cell to the 3rd cell.
2. Move the chip in the 7th cell to the 6th cell.

This shows that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
