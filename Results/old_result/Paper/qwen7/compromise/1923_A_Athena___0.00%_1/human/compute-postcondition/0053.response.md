Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`.
   - `a` is a list.
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the last element of `a` is `0` (`a[-1] == 0`).

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list with the last element removed.
   - This means `a` is no longer empty, but we don't know the value of `a[-1]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     1. `a` should not be empty.
     2. The last element of `a` should be `0`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `a` is a list with the last element removed, `a` is not empty, so the first condition is already satisfied.
   - We need to ensure that the last element of `a` is `0` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the last element of `a` is `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list with the last element removed and the last element of `a` must be 0**
