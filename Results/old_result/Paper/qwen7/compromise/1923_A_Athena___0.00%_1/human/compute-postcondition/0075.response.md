Output State: **`res` is equal to the number of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element, `a` is a list containing only the non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial states of `res`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, `res` remains equal to the number of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element, `a` contains only the non-zero elements from the original list starting from the second element, and `t` must be greater than 0. The new variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input by the user.
