Output State: **`res` is 0, `a` does not have its last element as 0 and is one element shorter than before**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given the initial state where `a` must not be empty and its last element must be 0, after executing the code, `a` no longer has its last element as 0 and is one element shorter than before. The value of `res` remains unchanged at 0.
