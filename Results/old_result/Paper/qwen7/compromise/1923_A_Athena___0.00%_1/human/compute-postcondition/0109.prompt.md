Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and it is now set to the integer input received.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    print(a)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `a` has had all its leading zeros removed, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` remains the original input integer, and `res` is the total count of leading zeros in the list `a` before any were removed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is equal to the number of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element, and `a` is a list containing only the non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the first element is not 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is equal to the length of `a`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
