Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, the first element of `a` is removed, `res` is 0, and `a` now has one less element than before.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` must not be empty is still valid, meaning `a` now has at least one element (one less than before).
