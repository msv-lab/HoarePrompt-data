Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, the index `i` is within the bounds of `a`, and the value of `a[i]` is 0; `res` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `a[i]` was 0 and no changes were made to `a` itself or `i`, the only change is that `res` is now 1.
