Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is 0.
- `a` is a list containing only the non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element.

The print statement `print(a)` will output the list `a`.

To determine the contents of `a`, we need to know the original list. Since the original list is not specified, let's assume an example original list to illustrate the process. For instance, if the original list is `[0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 0]`, then `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

However, since the exact original list is not provided, we can describe `a` in a general form. `a` contains all non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element.

Output: **[non-zero elements from the original list starting from the second element]**
