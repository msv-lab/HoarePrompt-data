Output State: **`res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the second last element is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was guaranteed to be 0, removing it does not affect the condition that all leading zeros have been removed (as there were no leading zeros to begin with) and the second last element is now the new last element, which is 0. The values of `res`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.
