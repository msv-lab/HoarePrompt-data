Output State: **`a` is a list with its last element removed and the last element was 0**.

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the initial state specified that the last element of `a` must be 0, after executing the code, the last element of `a` has been removed, and we know that the last element was 0.
