Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is `False`, `i` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be decremented until it reaches 0. The loop breaks when `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]` for all `i` from `m-1` down to 1. Since `ans` is set to `False` and remains `False` even if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is not met (as per the given conditions), `ans` will stay `False` regardless of the number of iterations. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, `ans` will still be `False`, and the other variables will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.
