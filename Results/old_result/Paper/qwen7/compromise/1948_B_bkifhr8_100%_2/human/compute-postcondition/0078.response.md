Output State: **`ans` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `m - 2`, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `m`, and `arr[i - 1]` (which should now be `arr[0]` since `i` is `m - 2`) remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `arr` is now updated to reflect the new list of integers.
