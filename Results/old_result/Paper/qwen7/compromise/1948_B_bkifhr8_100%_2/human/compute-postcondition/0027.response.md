Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs in reverse order from `m-1` to `1` (not including `0`). The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than `0`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`.
   - If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - If `nums` is already sorted, no change occurs to `ans` and the loop or if statement continues as normal.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be decremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `m` remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop body, but since no modification of `m` is mentioned, we assume `m` stays the same.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must be greater than `0`.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- `i` will be `i - 1` from its previous value.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must be greater than `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, where `nums` is a list containing integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `nums` is sorted, `i` is `i - 1`, and `m` remains the same.**
