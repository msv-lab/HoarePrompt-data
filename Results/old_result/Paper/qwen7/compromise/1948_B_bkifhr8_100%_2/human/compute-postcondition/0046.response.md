Output State: **`ans` is True, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by converting each digit of `arr[i - 1]` into integers and appending them to the list, followed by appending `arr[i]`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
