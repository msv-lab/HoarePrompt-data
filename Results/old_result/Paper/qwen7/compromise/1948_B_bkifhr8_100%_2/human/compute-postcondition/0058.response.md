Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `m` must be greater than `1`, `arr[i - 1]` remains `nums[0]`, `nums` is `[nums[0]] + [arr[0]] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the break statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `i`, `m`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
