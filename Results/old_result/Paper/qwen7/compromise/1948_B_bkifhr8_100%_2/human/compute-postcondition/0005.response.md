Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `m`, and the range function parameters. Specifically, the loop is defined as `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to `m - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `m - 1` for the loop to start.

3. **Determine the value of `m`**: Since `i` is set to `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 1 (because `i` starts from `m - 1` and goes down to 0). However, the initial state of `m` is given as an input integer, so we don't need to change its value but ensure it meets the condition for the loop to execute.

4. **Check the range parameters**: The range function parameters are `m - 1`, `0`, and `-1`. These values are derived from the initial state of `m` and do not need to be changed directly. The loop will execute as long as `m - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, which is true if `m` is greater than or equal to 1.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `m - 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`**
