Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `arr[i]` and `ans` remains False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
