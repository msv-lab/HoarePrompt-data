Output State: **`ans` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `m - 2`, `m` is an input integer, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is updated to `m - 2` because `i` was initially defined as `m - 2`. The value of `m` is updated to the integer input value. The value of `arr[i - 1]` remains `nums[0]` as it is not affected by the input operation.
