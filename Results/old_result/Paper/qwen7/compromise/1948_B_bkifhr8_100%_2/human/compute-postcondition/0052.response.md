Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `ans` remains True, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of the list `nums`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` remains True, `i` is still 0, `m` must still be greater than 1, and `nums` is still a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[0]`.
