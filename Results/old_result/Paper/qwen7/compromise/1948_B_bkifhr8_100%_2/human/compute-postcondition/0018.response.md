Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs in reverse order starting from `m - 1` down to `0`. The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `ans` is False.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.

4. **Loop body behavior**:
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `arr[i]` and `ans` remains False.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

5. **Next iteration state**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `m - 2`.
   - The value of `ans` will depend on the comparison in the loop body. If the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` was true, `ans` remains False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `n` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
- `m` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
- `arr` remains the same since it is not modified outside the loop.
- `i` is now `m - 2`.
- `ans` remains either False or True depending on the condition in the loop body.

Since we don't know the exact outcome of the loop body in the previous iteration, we'll keep `ans` as a conditional state.

**State:**
**`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` was not met, otherwise `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 2`**.
