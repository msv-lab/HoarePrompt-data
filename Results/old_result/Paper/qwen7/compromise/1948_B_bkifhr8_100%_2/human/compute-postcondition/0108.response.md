Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 4`, `m` must be at least 3, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the same as `nums[0]`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `nums` is not sorted and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid.
