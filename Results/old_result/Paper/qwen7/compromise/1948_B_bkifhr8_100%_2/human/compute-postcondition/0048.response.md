Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[0]`, and the current value of `nums` is not sorted.**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ans`, while the other variables (`i`, `m`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
