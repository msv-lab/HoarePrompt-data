Output State: **`ans` is `True`, `i` is `m - 2`, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = True` sets the variable `ans` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `m`, `arr`, and `arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
