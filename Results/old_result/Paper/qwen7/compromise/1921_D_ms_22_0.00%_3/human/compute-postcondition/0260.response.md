To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition that controls the loop's continuation, which is `max_heap`.

Here are the key points to consider:

1. The loop continues as long as `max_heap` is not empty.
2. The loop body updates `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `tp1`, and `tp2` based on the current `item` from the heap.

For the loop to continue, `max_heap` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is non-empty at the start of the next iteration.

Given the postcondition and the loop body, no specific adjustments are needed for `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `tp1`, or `tp2` to ensure the loop continues. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `max_heap` itself.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `max_heap` is not empty.
2. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**: Since the loop condition depends on `max_heap`, we need to ensure `max_heap` is non-empty for the next iteration.
3. **Check Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `max_heap` should be checked to ensure it is not empty.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `max_heap` must not be empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`max_heap` is not empty**
