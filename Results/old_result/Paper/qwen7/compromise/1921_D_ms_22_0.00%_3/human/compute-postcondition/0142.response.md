Output State: **`ans` is 0 + diff2, `max_heap` does not contain `item`, `item` is the smallest element from `max_heap` before it was removed, `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is updated to be its original value (which is 0) plus `diff2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, including `max_heap` not containing `item`, `item` being the smallest element from `max_heap` before removal, `item[2]` being less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` being the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` being the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, and `tp2` being decremented by 1.
