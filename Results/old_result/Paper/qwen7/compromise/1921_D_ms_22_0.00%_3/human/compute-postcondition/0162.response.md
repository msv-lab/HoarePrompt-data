Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `tp1` is increased by 1.**

The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `tp1`.
