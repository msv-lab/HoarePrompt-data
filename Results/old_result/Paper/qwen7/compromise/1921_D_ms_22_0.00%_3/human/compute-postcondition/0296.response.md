Output State: `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are the integers entered in the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in the last iteration and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input in the last iteration and converted to integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`, `tp2` is equal to 0, and `ans` is the cumulative sum of the differences calculated during all iterations of the loop as described.

After all iterations of the loop have been executed, `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `n` and `m` will retain the values they had in the last iteration of the loop. Similarly, `a` and `b` will contain the lists of integers from the last iteration's inputs. The `max_heap` will be empty since it is cleared during each iteration. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` will be set to their boundary values (`m - 1` and 0) and will not change further. Finally, `ans` will hold the total sum of the differences calculated over all iterations of the loop.
