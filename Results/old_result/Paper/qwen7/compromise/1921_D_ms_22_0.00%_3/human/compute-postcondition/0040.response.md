Output State: **`diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**

Explanation: The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1. Initially, `tp1` was 0, so after executing `tp1 += 1`, `tp1` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state and the condition `diff1 > diff2` remains true.
