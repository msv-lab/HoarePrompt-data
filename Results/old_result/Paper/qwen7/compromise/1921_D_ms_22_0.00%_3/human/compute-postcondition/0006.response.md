Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variable `b` now holds the integers from the new input.
