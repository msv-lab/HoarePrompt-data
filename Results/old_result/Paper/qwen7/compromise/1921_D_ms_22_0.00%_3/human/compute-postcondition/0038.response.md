Output State: **`diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. Since `tp2` is `m - 1`, `diff2` is specifically `abs(item[1] - b[m - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
