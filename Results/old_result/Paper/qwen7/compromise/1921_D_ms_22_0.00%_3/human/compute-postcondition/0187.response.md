Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0] - 1, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The variable `tp2` is decremented by 1, which means `tp2 -= 1` reduces the value of `tp2` by 1. Since `ans` was previously increased by `-item[0]`, it remains unchanged from its previous state. The condition that `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped also remains valid.
