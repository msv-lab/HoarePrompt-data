Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
