Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` and `m` are the integers entered in the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input in the last iteration and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input in the last iteration and converted to integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`, `tp2` is equal to 0, and `ans` is the cumulative sum of the differences calculated during all iterations of the loop as described.**
