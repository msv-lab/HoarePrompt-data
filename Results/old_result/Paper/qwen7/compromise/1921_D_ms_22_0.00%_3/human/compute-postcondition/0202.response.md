Output State: **`b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0 - 1, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `m - 1` to `tp2`. Since `m` is an input integer, `tp2` is now `m - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
