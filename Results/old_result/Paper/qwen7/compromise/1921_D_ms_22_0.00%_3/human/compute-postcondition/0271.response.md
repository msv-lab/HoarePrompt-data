Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0] - 1, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The variable `tp2` is decremented by 1. Since `tp2` was not directly initialized or given a specific value in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value before this operation. However, we know that `ans` was increased by `-item[0]` previously, and now `tp2` has been decreased by 1 without affecting `ans` directly. The condition about `max_heap` remains unchanged.
