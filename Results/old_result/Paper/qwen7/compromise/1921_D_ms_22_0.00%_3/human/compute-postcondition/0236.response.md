Output State: **`ans` is still 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is now the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`; `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping. The third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff2` to be the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
