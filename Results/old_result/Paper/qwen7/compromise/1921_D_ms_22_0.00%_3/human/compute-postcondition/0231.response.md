To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `max_heap`.

The loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple when the loop starts.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `ans` is still 0
- `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `i` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively
- `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `index` is either 0 or `m-1`

For the loop to execute the first time, `max_heap` must not be empty. Since the problem states that `max_heap` will contain tuples after the loop completes all its iterations, it implies that `max_heap` should contain at least one tuple right before the loop starts.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `max_heap` is not empty.

State: **`ans` is still 0, `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `i` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively, and `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple**
