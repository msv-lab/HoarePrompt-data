Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the condition of `item[2]`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, and the condition `(item[2] == tp1 or item[2] != tp1)` holds true.**
