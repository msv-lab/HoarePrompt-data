Output State: **`tp2` is decremented by 1, `tp1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2` plus the negative of `item[1]`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1] + 1`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff2` increments `ans` by the value of `diff2`. The value of `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `tp2` is decremented by 1, `tp1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `diff2`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1] + 1`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2] - 1`.
