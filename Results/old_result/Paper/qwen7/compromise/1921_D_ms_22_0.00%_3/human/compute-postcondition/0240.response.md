Output State: **`tp1` is 1, `ans` is 0 + diff1, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is now the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `diff1`, which is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`. The values of `tp1`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.
