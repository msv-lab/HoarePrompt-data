Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`, `tp2` is equal to 0, and `ans` is the total sum of the minimum absolute differences calculated for each element in list `a` with respect to the closest elements in list `b`.

After all iterations of the loop have been executed, `t` becomes 0 because the loop continues as long as `t > 0`. The variable `max_heap` remains empty as it is emptied out during each iteration. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are set to their respective boundary values (`m - 1` and 0) and do not change further. The variable `ans` holds the cumulative sum of the minimum absolute differences calculated for each element in list `a` with respect to the closest elements in list `b` according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
