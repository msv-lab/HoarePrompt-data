Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` (which is the second element of the `item` tuple) and `b[tp2]`. This new value is assigned to the variable `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
