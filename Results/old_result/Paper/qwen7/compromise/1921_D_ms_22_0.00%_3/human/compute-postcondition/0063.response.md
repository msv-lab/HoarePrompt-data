Output State: **`tp1` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is empty, `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` + 1, `ans` is incremented by `diff1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += diff1` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `diff1`. Since `diff1` is defined as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1 after this line, `diff1` now refers to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1 + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
