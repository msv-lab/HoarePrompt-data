Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(next_i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `ans` remains 0, `diff1` and `diff2` retain their original values, and `max_heap` will contain either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or not.
