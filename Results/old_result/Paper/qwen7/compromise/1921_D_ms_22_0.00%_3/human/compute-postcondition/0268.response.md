Postcondition: **`diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` respectively. `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1. In both cases, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, and `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` accordingly.**
