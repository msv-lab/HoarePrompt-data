The loop head is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop continues as long as `max_heap` is non-empty.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99.
- `n` is the first integer entered.
- `m` is the second integer entered.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped).
- `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the condition of `item[2]`.
- `ans` is the sum of `diff1` and `diff2` if `item[2]` is not within `[tp1, tp2]`, otherwise `ans` is `-item[0]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must be non-empty again. Since the top item has already been popped, `max_heap` must still contain at least one item.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `max_heap` to ensure it remains non-empty.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty**, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the condition of `item[2]`, `ans` is the sum of `diff1` and `diff2` if `item[2]` is not within `[tp1, tp2]`, otherwise `ans` is `-item[0]`.
