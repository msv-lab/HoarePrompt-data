Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]; `tp1` is incremented by 1.**

The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
