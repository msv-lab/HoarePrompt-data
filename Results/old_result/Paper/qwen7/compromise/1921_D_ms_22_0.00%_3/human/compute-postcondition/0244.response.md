Output State: **`ans` is 0 + diff2, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is now the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`; `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated to be its original value (which is 0) plus `diff2`. The values of `diff1`, `diff2`, `item`, and `tp2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
