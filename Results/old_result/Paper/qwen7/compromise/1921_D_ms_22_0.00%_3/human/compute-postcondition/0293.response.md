Output State: **`ans` will be the sum of its initial value (0) and all the maximum differences found during the iterations, `diff1` and `diff2` will be the final absolute differences calculated in the last iteration, and `max_heap` will be empty.** 

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will be the total sum of the maximum differences found in each iteration, `diff1` and `diff2` will store the final absolute differences calculated in the last iteration, and `max_heap` will no longer contain any items since they have all been processed.
