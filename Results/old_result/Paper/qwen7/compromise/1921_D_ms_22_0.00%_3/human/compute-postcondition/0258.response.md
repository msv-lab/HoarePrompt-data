Postcondition: `ans` is either the sum of its original value (0) and the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`, or `-item[0]`. `diff1` and `diff2` remain as the absolute differences between the second element of `item` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively. `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the following rules: if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + max(diff1, diff2)`, and if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is set to `item[2] + 1`; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
