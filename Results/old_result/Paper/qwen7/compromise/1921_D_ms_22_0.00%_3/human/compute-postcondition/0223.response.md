Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff1` to be `abs(i - b[0])`. The other variables (`ans`, `diff2`, `max_heap`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
