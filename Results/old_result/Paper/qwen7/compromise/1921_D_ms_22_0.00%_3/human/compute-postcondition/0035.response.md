Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0**

The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` pops the smallest element from the max heap (which is implemented as a min heap in Python) and assigns it to `item`. Since the heap was non-empty before the operation, it is now empty, but the other variables remain unchanged.
