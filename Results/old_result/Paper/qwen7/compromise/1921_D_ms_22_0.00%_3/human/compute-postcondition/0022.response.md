Output State: **`diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` is true or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 > diff2` is false, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between the next element in list `a` (denoted as `i`) and the last element in list `b` (denoted as `b[m - 1]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
