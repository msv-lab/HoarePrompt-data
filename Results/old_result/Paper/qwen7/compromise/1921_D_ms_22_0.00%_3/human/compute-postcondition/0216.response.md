Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(next_i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(next_i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, next_i, m - 1)` where `next_i` is the next value of `i` in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff1` to be the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`. Since `i` was previously referred to as `next_i`, we keep `next_i` in the description. The values of `ans`, `diff2`, and `max_heap` remain unchanged from their initial states.
