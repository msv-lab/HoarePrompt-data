Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, and `(item[2] >= tp1 and item[2] <= tp2)`**

Explanation: The code `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. Since `ans` was initially 0, it now becomes `-item[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
