Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1 > diff2` and `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`) or `diff2` (if `diff1 <= diff2` and `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`). Additionally, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if the condition `diff1 > diff2` is true; otherwise, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by -item[0] - 1. `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.
