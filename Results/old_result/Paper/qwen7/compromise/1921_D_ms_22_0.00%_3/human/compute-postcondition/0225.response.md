Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains either `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`**

Explanation: The code pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap`. The values of `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `max_heap` (initially containing `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`) are updated accordingly. Therefore, `ans` remains 0, `diff1` remains `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` remains `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` now contains both `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`.
