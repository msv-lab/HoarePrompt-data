Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` are as follows: if `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly, `ans` is updated based on the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2` plus the negative of `item[1]` or just `diff1`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1 or 2. If the condition is not met, `ans` is increased by the negative of `item[1]`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1, `tp2` is decremented by 2 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1.**
