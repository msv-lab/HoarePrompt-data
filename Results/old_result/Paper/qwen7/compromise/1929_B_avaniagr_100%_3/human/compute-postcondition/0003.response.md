Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are integers with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. It returns a value based on the conditions provided for n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k` with specified constraints and returns a value determined by the relationship between `n` and `k`.
