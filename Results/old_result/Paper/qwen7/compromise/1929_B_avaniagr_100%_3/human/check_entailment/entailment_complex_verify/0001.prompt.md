You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing an integer result based on the value of `k` relative to `n`. For each test case, if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the output is `math.ceil(k / 2)`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n - 1`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`. The number of lines in the output state is equal to the number of test cases provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between \( k \) and \( 4n - 2 \). If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). If \( k = 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n - 1 \). If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \). The function reads these values from standard input and outputs the results to standard output, with one line per test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks different conditions based on the value of \( k \):
     - If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
     - If \( k = 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n - 1 \).
     - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \).

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** \( k \leq 4n - 4 \)
     - This condition covers most cases where \( k \) is not too high.
     - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) seems reasonable because each cell can contribute to up to 2 diagonals.
   - **Condition 2:** \( k = 4n - 3 \)
     - This condition is specific and ensures that one more diagonal is covered than the previous condition.
     - The formula \( 2n - 1 \) is derived from the fact that coloring \( 2n - 1 \) cells can cover \( 4n - 3 \) diagonals.
   - **Condition 3:** \( k = 4n - 2 \)
     - This condition ensures that all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals are covered.
     - The formula \( 2n \) is derived from the fact that coloring \( 2n \) cells can cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.

4. **Edge Cases and Validation:**
   - The code handles the edge cases correctly for the given constraints.
   - The logic seems to cover all possible values of \( k \) within the given range.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to handle the problem correctly based on the provided conditions and examples. The logic for each condition is sound and covers all necessary cases.
