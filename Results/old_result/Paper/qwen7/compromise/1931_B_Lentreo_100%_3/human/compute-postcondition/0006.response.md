Output State: **`curr` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`.**

Explanation: The line `curr = 0` initializes the variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect the values of `nums`, `n`, `total`, or `mean`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
