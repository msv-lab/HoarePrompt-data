Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the mean (average) of the list `nums` by performing integer division of the total sum of the elements in `nums` by the length of `nums`. The variable `mean` is assigned this value, while the other variables (`nums`, `n`, and `total`) retain their original values and conditions.
