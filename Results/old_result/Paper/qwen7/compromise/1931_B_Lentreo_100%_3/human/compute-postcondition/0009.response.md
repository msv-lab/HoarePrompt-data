Output State: curr is -n, nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of all elements in nums, and mean is the integer division of total by n.

Explanation: After iterating through all elements in `nums`, `curr` accumulates the difference between each element and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without returning, `curr` will be the sum of all differences from the mean, which is equivalent to `-n` because each element in `nums` contributes to making `curr` less than 0 exactly once before the loop ends.
