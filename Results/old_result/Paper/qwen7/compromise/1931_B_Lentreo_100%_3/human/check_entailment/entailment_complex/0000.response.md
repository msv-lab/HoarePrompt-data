Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
2. The key observation is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, meaning the average amount of water per container is an integer.
3. The provided solution correctly calculates the average amount of water per container (`mean = total // n`). 
4. It then iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps a running sum of the differences between each amount and the mean (`curr`).
5. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means the current distribution cannot be made uniform, and the function returns 'NO'.
6. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means the distribution can be made uniform, and the function returns 'YES'.
7. The logic in the function is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
