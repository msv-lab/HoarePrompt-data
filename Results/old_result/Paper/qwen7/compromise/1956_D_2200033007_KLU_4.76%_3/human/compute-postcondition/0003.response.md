Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is a list of integers with a length `n` that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
- Each element `a_i` of the list `c` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `m` is 0.
- The list `c` equals 2.

However, the value of `c` being "2" suggests that `c` could be either a single-element list `[2]` or a list with multiple elements all being 2. Given the constraints, the most precise description of `c` is that it is a list where every element is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'4 1')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'4 1'` without any reference to the variables `c` or `m`.

Output: **4 1**
