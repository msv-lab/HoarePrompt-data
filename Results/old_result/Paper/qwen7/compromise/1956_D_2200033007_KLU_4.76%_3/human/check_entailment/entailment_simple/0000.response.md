Reasoning:
- The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, where each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
- The provided code does not actually implement the logic to find the MEX values and update the array. Instead, it has hardcoded outputs for specific conditions (when the length of the array is 2 or not).
- For an array of length 2, the provided solution correctly sets both elements to 2, achieving a sum of 4 and performing one operation.
- For other lengths, the solution incorrectly prints a fixed sum of 13 and 0 operations, which does not necessarily maximize the sum for arbitrary input arrays.
- Given the constraints and the need to handle any valid input array, the current implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
