Reasoning:
- The problem requires a program that maximizes the sum of an array by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times. The operation involves setting all elements in a subarray to the smallest non-negative integer not present in that subarray.
- The provided code does not implement the required logic for finding the optimal operations to maximize the sum of the array. Instead, it has hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array.
- For arrays of length 2, it correctly calculates the maximum sum as 4 and provides one operation to achieve this. However, for other lengths, it incorrectly hardcodes the sum as 13 without any operations, which is not generally the optimal solution.
- The execution summary indicates that the function does not dynamically calculate the MEX value or perform any operations on the array to maximize its sum. Therefore, the provided solution does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
