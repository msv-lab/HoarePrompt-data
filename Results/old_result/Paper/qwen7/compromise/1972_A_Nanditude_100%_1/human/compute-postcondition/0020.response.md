Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `j` will increment by 1.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j] < a[i]`.
   - `i` is increased by 1 otherwise.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The condition for increasing `cnt` or `i` does not affect the value of `j` directly; it affects other variables like `cnt` and `i`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - The condition for increasing `cnt` or `i` does not change the value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0.**
