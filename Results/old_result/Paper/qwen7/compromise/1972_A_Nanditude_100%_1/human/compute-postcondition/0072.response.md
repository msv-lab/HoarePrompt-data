Postcondition: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is a value within the range [0, n - 1), `cnt` is 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and `cnt` is 1 otherwise. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` becomes 2. If not, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, and `cnt` is updated accordingly to 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` and 0 otherwise. `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.**
