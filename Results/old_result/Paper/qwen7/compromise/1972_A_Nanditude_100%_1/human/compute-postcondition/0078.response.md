Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be either 0, 1, or 2, `j` will be a value within the range `[0, n - 1)`, and `cnt` will be equal to the total number of times `b[j]` was found to be less than `a[i]` during the entire execution of the loop. The variable `b` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
