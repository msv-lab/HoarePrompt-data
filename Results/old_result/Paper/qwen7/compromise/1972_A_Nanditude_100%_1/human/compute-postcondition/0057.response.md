Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is either 0 or `n + 1` (depending on the values in lists `a` and `b`), `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
