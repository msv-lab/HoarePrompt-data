Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is a value within the range [0, n), `cnt` is 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, and the current value of `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 0, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
