Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is a value within the range `[0, n - 1)`, `cnt` is 3 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and 2 otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and 1 otherwise, after executing the code, `cnt` will be 3 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and 2 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
