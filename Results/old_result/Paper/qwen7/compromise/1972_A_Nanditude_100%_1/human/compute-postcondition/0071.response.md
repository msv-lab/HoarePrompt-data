Output State: **`i` is 1 if it was 0, and 0 if it was 1, `j` is a value within the range [0, n - 1), `cnt` is 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and `cnt` is 0 otherwise, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1, after incrementing, `i` will now be 1 if it was initially 0, and 0 if it was initially 1. The values of `j`, `cnt`, and the list `b` remain unchanged.
