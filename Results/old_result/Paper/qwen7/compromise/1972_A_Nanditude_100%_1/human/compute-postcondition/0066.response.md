Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is a value within the range [0, n), `cnt` is 0, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, and b[j] is greater than or equal to a[i]**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `j`, `cnt`, and the list `b` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
