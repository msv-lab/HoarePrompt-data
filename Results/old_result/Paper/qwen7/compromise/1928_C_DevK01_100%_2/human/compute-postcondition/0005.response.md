Postcondition: **`q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, both `q` and `x` satisfy 1 ≤ `x` < `q` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a list containing the value of `w`, where `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer; if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `w` is added to the list `M`; otherwise, the list `M` remains unchanged.**
