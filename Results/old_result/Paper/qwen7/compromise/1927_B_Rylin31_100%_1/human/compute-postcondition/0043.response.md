Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'b', `s[j+1]` is `s[j+1] + 1`, `s` retains its original values, and `j` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans`. Given that `s[j]` is the character at position `j` in the string `s`, which is represented as an index into the string (where each character corresponds to an ASCII value), adding 97 to `s[j]` and converting it back to a character using `chr()` results in the next character in the alphabet. Since the last character of `ans` is 'a', and assuming `s[j]` is the character before 'a' in the string `s`, appending 'b' to `ans` changes the last character of `ans` to 'b'. The value of `s[j+1]` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values.
