Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in array:`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `array`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 98`.
   - `j` is the second element of `array`.
   - `array` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `s[j]` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand what happens in the loop**:
   - In each iteration, `j` takes the next value from the list `array`.
   - `s[j]` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the second element of `array` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will be the third element of `array`.
   - `s[j]` will be increased by 1 again.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it is based on the current value of `s[j]`, which will be updated in the next iteration.
   - `j` will be the third element of `array`.
   - `array` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `s[j]` will be increased by 1, but since we are only asked to state the conditions for the next iteration, we don't need to explicitly mention the new value of `s[j]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 98`, `j` is the third element of `array`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s[j]` is increased by 1**.
