Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The variables involved here are `x`, `len(nums)`, and implicitly `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is the loop variable, which starts at 0.
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be at least 1 because the range function generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `len(nums)`. If `len(nums)` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `x` starts at 0, no adjustment is needed for `x`.
   - We need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - No adjustment is needed for `nums` as its content is derived from the input string and is not directly modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`. Specifically, `num_tests` and `n` are not directly related to the loop execution, but `nums` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element**
