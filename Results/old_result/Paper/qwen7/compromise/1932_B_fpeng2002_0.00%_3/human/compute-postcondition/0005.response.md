Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `start_year` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `start_year`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged, and `start_year` is set to `0`.
