Output State: **`num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `start_year` is 0**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `start_year`. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, and `start_year` is now 0.
