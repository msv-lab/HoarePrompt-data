Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to (((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` to the result of the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since the initial values of `start_year` and `nums[x]` are not specified, they remain as part of the expression. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`) are not affected by this operation.
