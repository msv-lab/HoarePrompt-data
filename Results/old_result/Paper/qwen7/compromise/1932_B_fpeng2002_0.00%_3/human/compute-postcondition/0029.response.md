Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `num_tests` is greater than -1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
   - `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Since `num_tests` is initially greater than -1, we need to ensure that it remains greater than 0 for the next iteration.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num_tests` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`**.
