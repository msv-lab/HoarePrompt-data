Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, 1 â‰¤ `num_tests` â‰¤ 1000.**

The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial conditions for `t` and the list of integers for each test case remain unchanged and are only processed later when the corresponding test cases are handled.
