Output State: `start_year` is (((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `x` is 2, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `start_year` will be the result of applying the operation `(start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` successively for each index `x` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. This means `start_year` is updated in each iteration based on the current value of `start_year` and the current element in the `nums` list. The final value of `start_year` will be the result of these successive updates.
