Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `start_year` is (((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `x` is 2, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `start_year` will be the result of applying the operation `(start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` successively for each index `x` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. This means `start_year` is updated in each iteration based on the current value of `start_year` and the current element in the `nums` list. The final value of `start_year` will be the result of these successive updates.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list minus one (i.e., `len(nums) - 1`). Therefore, the final update to `start_year` will be based on the last element of the `nums` list. The `start_year` will be updated to `(((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1])`. All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list; `start_year` is the result of applying the formula (((((...((start_year + 1) // nums[x-1]) + 1) * nums[x-1]) + 1) // nums[x-2] + 1) * nums[x-2]) + ... + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] to the initial value of `start_year`, which is 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` will be the final computed value after repeatedly applying the given formula to each element in the `nums` list from the last element to the first element, starting with `start_year` initialized to 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
