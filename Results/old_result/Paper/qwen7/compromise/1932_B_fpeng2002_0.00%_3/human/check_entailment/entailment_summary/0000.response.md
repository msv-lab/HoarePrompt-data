Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse occurs, given the periodicity of each sign.
- The provided code attempts to solve this by iterating through the list of periodicities in reverse order and updating the `start_year` based on the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- However, the logic in the loop is flawed. The formula used does not correctly simulate the sequential waiting for each sign to occur.
- Instead, the correct approach would be to iteratively update the `start_year` by adding the maximum periodicity encountered so far, ensuring that all previous signs have occurred before moving to the next one.

Given the flaws in the logic, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
