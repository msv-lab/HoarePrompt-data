The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of size n x m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. It reads the grid and checks specific conditions related to the first and last rows of the grid. If the first row consists of the same character repeated and is different from the last row, or if the first row does not consist of a single character repeated and is not equal to the last row, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
