### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem asks whether it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the given operations. An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two squares to the same color.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), and the grid itself.
   - It then creates two strings: `first_row` (the first row of the grid) and `last_row` (the last row of the grid).
   - The function checks two conditions:
     - If the first row is uniform but different from the last row.
     - If the first row and the last row are uniform but different from each other.
   
3. **Conditions Check**:
   - The condition `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]` checks if the first row is uniform (all elements are the same) but different from the last row. This would mean it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first and last rows are different.
   - The condition `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row` checks if both the first and last rows are uniform but different from each other. This also means it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first and last rows are different.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, the function prints "YES", indicating it's possible to make all squares the same color.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles cases where the grid is already uniform.
   - However, the solution incorrectly handles cases where the grid can be made uniform by considering only the first and last rows and columns. The given solution only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider a grid where the first and last rows and columns are different, but the rest of the grid can be made uniform. For example:
     ```
     W B W
     B W B
     W B W
     ```
   - In this case, the first and last rows and columns are different, so the conditions in the given solution will trigger a "NO". However, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform by performing operations that change the middle parts of the grid.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given solution is flawed because it only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.
   - The solution fails to consider other possible configurations of the grid that can still be made uniform.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The given program incorrectly determines whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the provided problem description.

### Final:
Final: **False**
