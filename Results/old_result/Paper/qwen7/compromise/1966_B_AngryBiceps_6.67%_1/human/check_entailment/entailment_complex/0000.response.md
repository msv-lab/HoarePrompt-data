Reasoning:
The given solution does not correctly implement the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Conditions Check**: The solution checks if the first row is different from the last row and whether they contain the same character repeated. This condition alone is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are identical but contain mixed colors. The solution would incorrectly print 'YES' in such cases.

2. **Grid Consistency**: The solution only checks the first and last rows. However, the problem requires checking the entire grid. There might be cases where the first and last rows are the same, but other rows or columns prevent making all squares the same color.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem correctly, one should check if there exists a consistent color across the entire grid. Specifically, for each row and each column, ensure that all cells are the same color. If any row or column has mixed colors, it is impossible to make all squares the same color.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
