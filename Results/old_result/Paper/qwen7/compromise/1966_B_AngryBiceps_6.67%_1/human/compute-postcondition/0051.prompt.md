Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed plus 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `n` is updated to the value of `n, m = map(int, input().split())`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is the new value of `n`, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the input string from the user and the second element is the new input string, `first_row` is the concatenation of its previous value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is updated to include the last element of the last string in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is \(i_{prev} + 1\), `n` is \(n_{prev} + 1\), `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the input string from the user, the second element is the new input string, and the third element is the latest input string, `first_row` is the concatenation of its previous value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is updated to include the last character of the last element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
