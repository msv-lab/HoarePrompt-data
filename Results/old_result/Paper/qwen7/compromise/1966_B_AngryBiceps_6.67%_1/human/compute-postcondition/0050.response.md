Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is the final value of `n`, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `a` is a list containing all the input strings provided during the loop's execution, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string concatenated in order, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string concatenated in reverse order.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `t` will still be within the given range, `m` will be the integer obtained from the third input, `i` will be the final value of `n`, and `n` will be the total number of times the loop was executed. The list `a` will contain every string input during the loop's execution. The string `first_row` will consist of the first character of each input string in the order they were entered, and `last_row` will consist of the last character of each input string, but in reverse order (from the last string to the first).
