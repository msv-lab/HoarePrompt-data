Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations, `a` is a list containing all the input strings provided during the loop's iterations, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in the list `a`, and `last_row` is the last character of each element in the list `a` concatenated together. If the first string in the list `a` consists of the same character repeated and is different from the last string in the list `a`, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, the output will be 'NO'. In all other cases, the output will be 'YES'.

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop where all inputs have been processed, and the decision ('YES' or 'NO') is based on the conditions specified within the loop.
