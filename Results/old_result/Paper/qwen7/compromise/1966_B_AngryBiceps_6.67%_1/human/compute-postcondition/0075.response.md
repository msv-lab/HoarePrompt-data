Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original element plus the new input), `first_row` is the concatenation of its original last character and the first character of the last element in list `a`, `last_row` is equal to the last character of the second element in list `a`, `last_row` is updated by adding the last character of the last element in list `a` to itself.**

In more detail:
- `t` remains unchanged as it was initially a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `m` retains the value it had after the first input.
- `i` remains equal to `n`, which is at least 1.
- `a` is a list containing two elements, where the second element is updated by appending the last character of the last element in `a` to `last_row`.
- `first_row` remains the concatenation of its original last character and the first character of the last element in list `a`.
- `last_row` is updated by adding the last character of the second element in list `a` to itself.
