Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part. This means the loop will iterate based on the integer input provided.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed.
   - `i` is \(n-1\).
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the second input.
   - `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each being the input provided in each iteration).
   - `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in the list `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last character of each element in the list `a` concatenated together.

3. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, the next value of `n` will be the current `n` plus 1.
   - `i` will be `n-1`, so it will be `n` in the next iteration.
   - `m` will be the integer obtained from the third input.
   - `a` will have one additional element, making it `n+1` elements long.
   - `first_row` will include the first character of the new element.
   - `last_row` will include the last character of the new element.

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `n` will be incremented by 1.
- `i` will be `n-1`, which is `n` in the next iteration.
- `m` will be the integer obtained from the third input.
- `a` will have one additional element.
- `first_row` will be updated to include the first character of the new element.
- `last_row` will be updated to include the last character of the new element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed plus 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `a` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of each element in the list `a` concatenated together.**
