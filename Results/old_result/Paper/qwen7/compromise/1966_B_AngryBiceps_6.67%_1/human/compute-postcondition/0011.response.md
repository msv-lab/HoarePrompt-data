Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original element and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`. The other variables remain unchanged.
