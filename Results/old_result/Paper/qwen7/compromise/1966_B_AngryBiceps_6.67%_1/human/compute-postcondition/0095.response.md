Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. Additionally, it accepts a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns information about the grid based on certain conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a grid of specified dimensions filled with 'W' and 'B', and a count of how many such grids to process. The exact nature of the return value isn't specified here, but it implies the function will analyze each grid according to some criteria and provide a result for each test case.
