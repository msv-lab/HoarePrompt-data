Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the input string from the user and the second element is the new input string, `first_row` is the concatenation of its previous value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is updated to include the last element of the last string in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of the last string in the list `a` to `last_row`. The values of `t`, `m`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `first_row` remain unchanged except for `last_row`, which now includes the last character of the last string in `a`.
