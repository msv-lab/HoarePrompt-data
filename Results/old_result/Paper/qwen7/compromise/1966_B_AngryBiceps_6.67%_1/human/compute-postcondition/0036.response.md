Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed plus 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `n` is updated to the value of `n, m = map(int, input().split())**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`) remain unchanged, and `first_row` and `last_row` are both set to empty strings initially.
