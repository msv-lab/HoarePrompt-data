Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `i` is \(n-1\), `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each being the input provided in each iteration), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of each element in the list `a` concatenated together.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the specified range, `n` will be the total number of inputs provided, `i` will be \(n-1\) since the loop increments `i` from 0 to \(n-1\). The list `a` will contain all the inputs provided during the loop's execution. `first_row` will be a string made up of the first character from each input, and `last_row` will be a string made up of the last character from each input.
