Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided, `first_row` is the last character of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is equal to an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one element, `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `[0]` accesses its first character. The value of `first_row` is updated accordingly, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
