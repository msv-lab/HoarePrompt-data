Output State: **`i` is 0, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` starts at 0 and the condition `i` must be less than or equal to `len(a) // 2` is initially true. The line `kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` updates `kq` by adding the difference between the last element of `a` (since `len(a) - i - 1` would be `len(a) - 1` when `i` is 0) and the first element of `a` (since `a[i]` is `a[0]` when `i` is 0). After this operation, `i` remains 0 because the loop or further increment/decrement of `i` is not shown in the given code snippet.
