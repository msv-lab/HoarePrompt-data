Output State: **`i` is 3, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The variable `kq` is updated by adding the value of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, this translates to `a[len(a) - 3 - 1] - a[3]` or `a[len(a) - 4] - a[3]`. Therefore, `kq` now includes this additional term.
