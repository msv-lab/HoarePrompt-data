Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`). It then sorts the array in non-decreasing order.
3. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the array is calculated by summing the differences between the elements at the end of the array and the beginning of the array. Specifically, it sums up `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for the first half of the sorted array.
4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the calculated beauty for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements. The program correctly handles the constraints and performs the necessary operations to achieve the desired result.

Correctness: **True**
