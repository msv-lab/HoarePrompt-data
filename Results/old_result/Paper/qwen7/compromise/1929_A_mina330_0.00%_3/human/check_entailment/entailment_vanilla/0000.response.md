### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to have the largest possible values in positions where they can contribute positively to the sum, and the smallest possible values in positions where they can contribute negatively.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by pairing the smallest half of the sorted array with the largest half and summing the differences.
   - Specifically, for each pair \((a[i], a[len(a) - i - 1])\), it computes \(a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements.
   - By subtracting the smaller element from the larger one, we ensure that the differences are maximized.
   - This approach works because the beauty is maximized when the positive contributions (larger elements) are maximized and the negative contributions (smaller elements) are minimized.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.
   - It correctly processes the input and outputs the maximum beauty as required.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the solution.
   - For instance, in the first example, sorting \([2, 1, 3]\) gives \([1, 2, 3]\), and the beauty is calculated as \((3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 2\).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
