You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `c`, `c` is a list of integers where integers greater than 10 have been processed according to the conditions in the loop, and `n` is the number of elements in `c`.

    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in the list `c`, `c` is a list of integers where integers greater than 10 have been processed according to the conditions in the loop, `d` is a sorted version of the list `c`, and `b` is either a list with the value 1 appended to it or a list containing 0, depending on whether `c` is equal to the sorted version `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99). For each integer greater than 10 in the input list, it extracts the last digit and the remaining part, then appends these parts to a new list c based on certain conditions. After processing all test cases, it checks if the list c is sorted. If c is sorted, it appends 1 to a list b; otherwise, it appends 0 to b. The function does not return any value but modifies the list b according to the sorting condition of the processed list c.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not pass any arguments to it.
   - This means `func_1()` will be called `m` times without any input, which is incorrect because `func_1()` expects input parameters.

3. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - Reads the size of the array `k`.
   - Reads the array elements as a string and converts them to integers.
   - Initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` to manage the transformation process.
   - Iterates through the array elements and performs the transformation logic:
     - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and checks if the new digit can be added to the list `c` while maintaining the non-decreasing order.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it simply adds it to the list `c`.
   - Sorts the list `c` and checks if it is sorted.
   - Appends `1` to `b` if the transformed list `c` is sorted, otherwise appends `0`.

4. **Printing Results:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

### Issues Identified:
- The main loop `for i in range(m): func_1()` should pass the test case index `i` to `func_1()`, but it does not.
- The function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, which leads to incorrect behavior.
- The logic in `func_1()` seems correct for transforming the array and checking if it can be sorted, but it needs to be called correctly with the appropriate test case data.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to modify the main loop to pass the test case index to `func_1()` and ensure it processes the correct input for each test case.

```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1(i)

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1(test_case_index):
    k = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)
```

### Conclusion:
After making the necessary corrections, the program should now work correctly. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the lack of proper parameter passing to `func_1()`. The corrected version would be correct.

Correctness: **False**
