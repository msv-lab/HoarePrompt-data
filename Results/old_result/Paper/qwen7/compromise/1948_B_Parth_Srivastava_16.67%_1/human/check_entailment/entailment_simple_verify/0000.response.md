### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted using the operation of splitting numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits.
- The program should handle arrays with both single-digit and multi-digit numbers.
- The program should only split numbers greater than or equal to 10.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - It reads the size of the array `k` and the array itself from the input.
   - It processes each element of the array:
     - If the element is greater than 10, it splits the number into its digits.
     - It checks if the split digits can be added to the list `c` in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order.
   - After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c` and checks if it is sorted.
   - Based on the result, it appends either 1 or 0 to the list `b`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Handling Single-Digit Numbers:**
   - The program incorrectly attempts to process single-digit numbers (less than 10) as if they were multi-digit numbers.
   - This leads to incorrect results because the operation can only be applied to numbers greater than or equal to 10.

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The sorting logic in the program is flawed. It checks if the processed list `c` is sorted, but it does not ensure that the original array can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input: `3\n2\n9 10`
     - The program will attempt to split the number 9, which is incorrect.
     - The correct output should be "NO", but the program will produce an incorrect result due to the attempted split of 9.

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle single-digit numbers and does not correctly implement the sorting logic required by the problem.
