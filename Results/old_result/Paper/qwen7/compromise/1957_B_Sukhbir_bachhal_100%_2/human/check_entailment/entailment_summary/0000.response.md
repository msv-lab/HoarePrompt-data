Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the bitwise OR of these integers has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and processing each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n > 1 \), it constructs a sequence where:
     - One element is set to \( 2^{\text{func\_1}(k)} - 1 \), which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the bit length of \( k \).
     - Another element is set to \( k - (2^{\text{func\_1}(k)} - 1) \), ensuring the sum is \( k \).
     - The remaining elements are set to 0.
   - If \( n = 1 \), it simply prints \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the highest bit position of \( n \) (excluding the case when \( n = 0 \)).
   - It works correctly by repeatedly right-shifting \( n \) until it becomes 0, counting the shifts.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( n = 1 \), the program correctly outputs \( k \).
   - When \( n > 1 \), the constructed sequence ensures the sum is \( k \) and the bitwise OR operation will have the maximum number of 1s possible given the constraints.

5. **Validation**:
   - The provided examples in the execution summary match the expected behavior of the program.
   - The logic for constructing the sequence is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement and the provided execution summary. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
