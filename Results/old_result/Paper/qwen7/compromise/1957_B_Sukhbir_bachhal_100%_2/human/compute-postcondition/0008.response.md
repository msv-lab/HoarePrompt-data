Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is 1, `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1.**

The code `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `n` by 1 bit. This means that each bit in the binary representation of `n` is shifted one position to the right, and the least significant bit is discarded. The value of `n` is effectively divided by 2, but as an integer division. The other variables `t` and `position` remain unchanged.
