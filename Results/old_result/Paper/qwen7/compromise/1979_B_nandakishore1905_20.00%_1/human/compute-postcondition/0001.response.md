Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `k`, `1`, `2`, or `k - q`, where `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` for each iteration of the loop. The specific value printed depends on the conditions met by `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints `1`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it calculates `q` as the highest power of 2 less than `k` and prints `k - q`.
