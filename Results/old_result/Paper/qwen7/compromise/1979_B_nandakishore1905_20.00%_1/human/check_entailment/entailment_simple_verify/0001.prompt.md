You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

        k = abs(n - m)

    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = abs(n - m)
        
        if k & k - 1 == 0:

            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:

            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `k`, `1`, `2`, or `k - q`, where `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` for each iteration of the loop. The specific value printed depends on the conditions met by `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints `1`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it calculates `q` as the highest power of 2 less than `k` and prints `k - q`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent `x` and `y` from the problem statement.

2. **Key Logic:**
   - The program calculates `k = abs(n - m)`.
   - It then checks if `k & (k - 1) == 0`. This condition checks if `k` is a power of 2.
     - If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`.
     - If not, it further checks specific conditions involving `n` and `m`:
       - If `n == 0` and `m` is odd, it prints `1`.
       - If `n == 0` and `m` is even, it prints `2`.
       - Otherwise, it converts `k` to binary, counts the number of leading zeros, and prints `k - 2^(leading_zeros)`.

3. **Analysis of Conditions:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically:
     - The program incorrectly assumes that the length of the longest common subsegment is directly related to the absolute difference between `x` and `y`.
     - The program does not correctly compute the longest common subsegment of the sequences `a` and `b`.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the example inputs:
     - Test case 1: `x = 0`, `y = 1`
       - `k = 1`, which is a power of 2, so the program prints `1`. This is correct.
     - Test case 2: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
       - `k = 8`, which is a power of 2, so the program prints `8`. This is correct.
     - Test case 3: `x = 57`, `y = 37`
       - `k = 20`, which is not a power of 2, and the program incorrectly prints `20 - 16 = 4`. The correct answer should be 4, but the program logic is flawed.
     - Test case 4: `x = 316560849`, `y = 14570961`
       - `k = 301989888`, which is not a power of 2, and the program incorrectly prints `301989888 - 2^25 = 33554432`. The correct answer should be 33554432, but the program logic is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to accurately determine the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences `a` and `b`.

### Correctness:
**False**
