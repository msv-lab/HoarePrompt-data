Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is the final value after processing all elements in the list `a` and appending it to `results`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`.**

Explanation: The given code snippet writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, each element separated by a newline. Since the `results` list contains the string representation of `last_year` for each iteration, after writing these values, the list `results` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` is still equal to `n`, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed. The variable `last_year` holds the final computed value after processing the last element in the list `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state described.
