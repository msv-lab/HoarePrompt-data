Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` must be 1 or greater.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue, if `i` was at its maximum value (which is `n-1`), it would increment to `n` in the next iteration. However, since `i` must be less than `n`, `i` must be less than `n-1` in the current iteration.
   - Given that `n` is greater than 3, the smallest possible value for `n` is 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` (which is at least 4).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be less than `n`, and since `n` is at least 4, `i` must be less than 4.
   - `n` remains greater than 3.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` must be less than 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` must be less than 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`**.
