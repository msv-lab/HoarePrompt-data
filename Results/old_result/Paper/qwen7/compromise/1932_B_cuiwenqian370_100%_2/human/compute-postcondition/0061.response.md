Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is the final value after processing all elements in the list `a` and appending it to `results`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` for each iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed. The variable `last_year` will hold the final computed value after processing the last element in the list `a` through the inner loop. The `results` list will contain the final `last_year` value as a string for each iteration that was executed, which in this case would be the final value of `last_year` after all iterations.
