Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start when `i` is 1 and continue as long as `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop requirements**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is 1 initially.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 so that the loop can execute at least once.

4. **Consider the given initial states**:
   - `index` is incremented by `n`.
   - `n` is assigned the value of `data[index-1]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` starting from `index-1` and continuing for `n` elements.
   - `last_year` is the first element of list `a`.

Given these points, the key variables to adjust are `i` and `n`. Since `i` is incremented by `n` and `n` is assigned the value of `data[index-1]`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 so that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
