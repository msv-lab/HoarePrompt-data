Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `last_year` equals `next_year`
   - `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The condition `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged since it is a constraint on `n` and not directly modified by the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains the same as it must still be at least 1.
   - `last_year` and `next_year` are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly modified by the loop, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, `last_year` equals `next_year`, `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]`**
