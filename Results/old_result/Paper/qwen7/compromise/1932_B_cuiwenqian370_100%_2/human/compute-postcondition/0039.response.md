Output State: `i` is 3, `last_year` is 4.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`. Since `a[i]` is 3 after the third iteration, it implies that `n` is at least 4. The loop stops when `i` equals `n`, so after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. Given that `last_year` remains 4 even after the third iteration, and there's no indication that it changes further within the loop, `last_year` will still be 4 after all iterations.
