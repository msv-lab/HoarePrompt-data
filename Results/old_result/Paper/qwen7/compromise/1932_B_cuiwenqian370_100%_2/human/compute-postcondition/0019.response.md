Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, `last_year` equals `next_year`, `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, the formula simplifies to `(last_year + a[3] - 1) // a[3] * a[3]`. However, since `a[3]` is not provided, we keep it in the form given. The initial value of `next_year` was equal to `last_year`, so after the update, `next_year` is now `(last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
