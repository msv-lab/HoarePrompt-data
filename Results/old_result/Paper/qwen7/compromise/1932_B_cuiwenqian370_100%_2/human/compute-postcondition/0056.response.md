Output State: **`i` is 4, `next_year` is (last_year + 1 + a[4] - 1) // a[4] * a[4], `last_year` is next_year**

Explanation: The code `last_year = next_year` updates the value of `last_year` to be the same as `next_year`. The value of `next_year` is defined as `(last_year + 1 + a[4] - 1) // a[4] * a[4]`. Since `last_year` is updated to `next_year`, the expression for `next_year` remains unchanged. The variable `i` and the condition for `n` are not affected.
