The only object in the loop head is the variable `T`, which is used in the range function. However, since `T` is not explicitly mentioned in the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to infer its value based on the information given.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `last_year` is 4
- `results` is ['4']

The loop condition is `for _ in range(T)`, which means the loop will run `T` times. Since `i` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it implies that the loop has already executed once (as `i` starts from 0). Therefore, `T` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `T` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 4, `results` is ['4'], `T` must be greater than or equal to 4**
