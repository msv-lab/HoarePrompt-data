Output State: **`i` is 4, `next_year` is (last_year + 1 + a[4] - 1) // a[4] * a[4], `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code calculates `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `next_year` is computed based on `last_year`, `a[4]`, and the operations specified in the formula. The value of `n` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 3.
