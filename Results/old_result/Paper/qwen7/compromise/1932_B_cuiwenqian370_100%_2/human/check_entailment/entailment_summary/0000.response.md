Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input data using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. It iterates over each test case, extracting the necessary values for `n` and the list `a`.
3. For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the first element of `a`.
4. It then iterates through the remaining elements of `a`, calculating the next year in which the sign would occur based on the current `last_year`. This calculation is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and strictly greater than `last_year`.
5. The program appends the final `last_year` value to the `results` list for each test case.
6. Finally, it writes the results to the standard output, formatted as a list of strings.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
