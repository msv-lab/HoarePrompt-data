### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes variables and processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity value `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining periodicities and calculates the next year when the next sign will occur. This calculation ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic to calculate the next year (`next_year`) is correct. It uses the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all periodicities for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` value to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it joins the results and writes them to the standard output.

Given the provided code, the logic appears to be correct and matches the problem description. The code handles the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct result.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.

### Correctness:
**True**
