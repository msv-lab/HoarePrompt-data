Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
