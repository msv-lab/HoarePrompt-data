Output State: **The program returns a list of integers which is the reversed version of 'ans', where each element is the result of the product of all elements in 'b' (in reverse order) modulo 'm'.**

This means that the program will return a list where each element is calculated as follows: starting from the last element of the original 'ans' list and moving towards the first, it computes the product of all elements in 'b' (in reverse order) and takes the result modulo 'm'. The final output is this reversed list.
