Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly processes the commands according to the problem statement.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and iterates through the commands, appending the appropriate elements from the array `a` to the list `b`.
3. After constructing the list `b`, it calculates the product of its elements modulo `m` in reverse order and appends these results to the list `ans`.
4. Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality without any logical errors or discrepancies.

Correctness: **True**
