Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and performs a series of operations based on the values of `n` and `k`. It prints queries and updates variables `v` and `l` through function calls. If certain conditions are met, it prints a final result and returns `l + 3`. In other cases, it either returns `None` or does not return any value.**
