Output State: **`cnt` is `k - 2` and `l` is `func_2() + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is decremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is `k - 1`. After decrementing, `cnt` becomes `k - 2`. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it is defined as `func_2() + 1` and no operation affects it. Therefore, `l` is still `func_2() + 1`.
