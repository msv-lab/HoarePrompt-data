Output State: **n is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), i is 1, and v is \(n - 3\).**

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` equal to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1. After the third iteration, `i` becomes `n - 3`. According to the provided conditions, if `v` equals `n` at any point, the loop breaks and sets `v` to the current value of `i`. Since the loop breaks after the third iteration with `v` being `n - 2`, the value of `v` remains `n - 2` after the loop completes. However, since the loop has finished and `i` continues to decrement, by the final iteration, `i` will be 1 and `v` will retain its last known value before the break, which is `n - 2`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` is 1 and `v` is `n - 2`.
