Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 2`, `v` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned, the `break` statement implies that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `n`, `i`, and `v` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
