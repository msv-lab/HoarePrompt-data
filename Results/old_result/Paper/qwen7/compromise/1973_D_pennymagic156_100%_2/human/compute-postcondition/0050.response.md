Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

2. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `cnt` is equal to `k`.
   - `l` is equal to `1`.
   - `i` is equal to `k - 2`.

3. **Determine which parts of the loop condition need adjustment**:
   - The loop will execute if both `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l < n + 1` is true.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `cnt` is `k`, which is non-zero (assuming `k` is not zero).
   - `l` is `1`, and we need to check if `1 < n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `cnt` is already non-zero (`k` is assumed to be non-zero), no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.
   - For `l < n + 1` to be true, `l` (which is `1`) must be less than `n + 1`. This means `n` must be at least `0`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure `l < n + 1` is true.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
