Output State: `cnt` is `0` and `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`. Given that the loop executes until `cnt` becomes `0`, it means `cnt` was initially `k` and after 3 iterations, it became `k - 3`. Therefore, if we assume `k` was 3 (since it went down by 3 after 3 iterations), then after all iterations, `cnt` would be `0`. The value of `l` is set to `func_2() + 1` right before the condition check in the loop, and since the loop terminates when `cnt` becomes `0`, `l` remains as `func_2() + 1`.
