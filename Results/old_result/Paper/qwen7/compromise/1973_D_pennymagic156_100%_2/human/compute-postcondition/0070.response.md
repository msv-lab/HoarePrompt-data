Output State: **`cnt` is `k`, `i` is `2`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`.**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` to the value of `k` and sets `l` to `1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The precondition that `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` still holds true, but since `n` is not mentioned in the initial state and no new value for `n` is provided, we do not include it in the output state.
