Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n // k + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is `k - 3`
   - `l` is `func_2() + 3`
   - Either `cnt` is not equal to 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs based on `i < n // k + 1`, we need to check if `i` can be incremented by 1 and still satisfy the loop condition.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k - 3`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 2`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `k - 2 < n // k + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `cnt` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes from `k - 3` to `k - 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`, `i` is `k - 2`, and either `cnt` is not equal to 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
