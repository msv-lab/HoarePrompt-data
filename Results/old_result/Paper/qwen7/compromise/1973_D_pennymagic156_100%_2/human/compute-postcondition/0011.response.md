Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `v` is `n`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `i` is defined as `n - 1`.
2. The value of `i * n` is therefore `(n - 1) * n`.
3. The `print` statement formats and prints the string `'? 1 {i * n}'`, where `{i * n}` is replaced with the value of `i * n`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? 1 (n - 1) * n'**
