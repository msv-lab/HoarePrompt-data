Output State: `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. After each iteration, `cnt` is decremented by 1, and `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`. Given that the loop executes 3 times, `cnt` will be reduced from `k - 3` (after 3 iterations) to `0`. Additionally, since `l` starts at `1` and increases by `1` with each iteration (`func_2() + 1` from the previous state plus `1`), after 3 iterations, `l` will be `func_2() + 3`.
