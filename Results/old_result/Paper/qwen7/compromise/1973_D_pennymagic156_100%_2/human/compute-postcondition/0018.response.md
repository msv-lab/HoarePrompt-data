Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `v` is the return value of `func_2()` (though `v` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Let's break it down:
1. `i` is defined as `n - 2`. So, `i` will be a positive integer where \(1 \leq i \leq n - 2 \leq 10^4 - 2 = 9998\).
2. The expression `i * n` will be the product of `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string that includes the value of `i * n`:

Output: **'? 1 [i * n]** (where `i` is `n - 2`)
