Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is `k - 1` and `cnt` must be non-zero.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 2` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, both `cnt` must be non-zero (`cnt > 0`) and `l < n + 1` must hold true.

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `cnt` is `k - 1` and `cnt` must be non-zero, meaning `k - 1 > 0` or `k > 1`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 2` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`, meaning `func_2() + 2 < n + 1` or `func_2() < n - 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `cnt` is already `k - 1` and `k > 1`, `cnt` is non-zero, no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.
   - For `l` to be less than `n + 1`, `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 2 < n + 1`. This means `func_2()` must return a value less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are those related to `l` to ensure `l < n + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` is `k - 1` and `cnt` must be non-zero; `l` is `func_2() + 2` and `l` must be less than `n + 1` and `func_2()` must return a value less than `n - 1`**
