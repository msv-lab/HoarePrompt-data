Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `cnt` and `l`.
3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `cnt` is `cnt - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied:
- `cnt` must be truthy (non-zero).
- `l < n + 1` must be true.

Given that `cnt` is `cnt - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` must be non-zero for the loop to execute again. This means `cnt` must be greater than 0.

Since `l` is `func_2() + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `cnt` and `l`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `n + 1`**
