Output State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0, `l` is equal to `func_2()` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `func_2()` plus 1 to the variable `l`. Since the exact return value of `func_2()` is not specified, we represent it as `func_2() + 1`. The precondition that `cnt` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the new condition for `l` is that it is equal to `func_2()` plus 1.
