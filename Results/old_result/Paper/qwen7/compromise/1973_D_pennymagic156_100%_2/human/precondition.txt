None of the input variables are provided in the function definition. However, based on the problem description, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers n and k, representing the length of the hidden array and the number of subarrays in the desired split, respectively. Additionally, the function should be able to make queries to determine the value of f(l, r) for given l and x, and provide the answer when requested.
