### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input and Function Definitions**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) using `func_1()`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - Functions `func_2()` and `func_4()` are defined but not used in the main logic of `func_5()`.

2. **Function `func_5()`**:
   - It reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes `v` to 1 and performs a series of queries to determine the value of `v`.
     - It queries the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `n` down to 1.
     - If `v` becomes `n`, it breaks out of the loop and sets `v` to `i`.
   - It then enters a loop where it tries to split the array into `k` subarrays with the same value `m`.
     - For each segment, it queries the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` for increasing values of `l` starting from 1 up to `n`.
     - If it successfully finds a valid split for all segments, it prints the value of `m` and exits.
   - If no valid split is found, it prints `-1`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The program uses `print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)` to send queries to the judge.
   - It uses `func_2()` to receive the response from the judge, which is the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The program uses `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)` to send the final answer to the judge.
   - It uses `func_2()` to check if the answer is correct.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
- It performs the necessary queries to determine the value of `v` and then attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the same value `m`.
- The logic for determining the value of `v` and checking the splits is consistent with the problem requirements.
- The program flushes the output after each query and answer, ensuring proper interaction with the judge.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
