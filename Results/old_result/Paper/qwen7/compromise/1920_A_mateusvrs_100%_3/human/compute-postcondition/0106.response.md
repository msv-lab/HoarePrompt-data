Output State: **`r` is a list, `t` is at least 0 and does not change during the loop, `_` is `n`, `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique integers `x` that were input during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of the smallest `x` entered and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` entered, `a` is the last value read from input during the loop, `x` is the last value read from input during the loop, and `tmp` is 0.**

The code initializes `tmp` to 0, which is a new variable introduced in the current scope. All other variables retain their initial states.
