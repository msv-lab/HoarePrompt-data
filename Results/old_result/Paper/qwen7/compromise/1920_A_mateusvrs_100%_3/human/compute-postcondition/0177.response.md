Output State: **`cx` is a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used, `i` is the next value from the updated `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. The values of `cx` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `cx` still contains all the values from the original set except the one that was just used, `i` is still the next value from the updated `cx`, and `tmp` is now increased by 1.
