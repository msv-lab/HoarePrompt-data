Postcondition: `_` is 2, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Otherwise, `cx` becomes a set containing `x`, and `ax` is set to 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000007.
