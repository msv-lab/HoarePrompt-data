Output State: **`cx` is a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used and the next value, `i` is the next value from the updated `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1.**

In this case, the code simply increments the value of `tmp` by 1. The sets `cx` and the variable `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the same description as the initial state, with the only change being that `tmp` has been incremented by 1.
