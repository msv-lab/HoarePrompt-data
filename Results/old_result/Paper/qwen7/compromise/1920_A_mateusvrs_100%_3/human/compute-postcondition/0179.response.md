Postcondition: **`cx` is a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used, `i` is the next value from the updated `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1. This holds true whether `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, or if it does not meet these conditions.**
