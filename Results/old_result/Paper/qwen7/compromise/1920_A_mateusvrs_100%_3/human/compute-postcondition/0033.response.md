Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000007 (or 1000000007 if `x` is greater than 1000007), `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially either an empty set or a set containing `x`, after adding `x` to it, `cx` now contains `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
