Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `i`, which is taken from the set `cx`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is taken from the set `cx` in each iteration, we need to ensure that `cx` is non-empty for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `cx` contains at least one element for the loop to start executing. The other variables (`tmp`, `_`, `t`, `ax`, `bx`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's execution conditions.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cx` to ensure it is non-empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one `x` value**
