Postcondition: `_` is `n`, `t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer provided initially, `cx` is a set containing all the `x` values that were added during the loop iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 2`), and `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 1`). Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.
