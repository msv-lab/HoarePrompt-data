Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `a` is 1, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `-1`. Since `x` is an input integer, the new value of `bx` depends on whether `x` is greater than `-1` or not. The other variables remain unchanged.
