Output State: **`cx` must contain at least one element, `i` will be the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `cx` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `cx`, the condition for checking whether `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]` is not relevant here because the value of `tmp` is updated regardless of the condition. Therefore, `tmp` is increased by 1.
