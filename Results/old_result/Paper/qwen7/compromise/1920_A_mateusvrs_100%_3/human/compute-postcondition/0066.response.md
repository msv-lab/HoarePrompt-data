Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `_` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a dummy variable used to iterate over the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current States**:
   - `r` is a list.
   - `t` is at least 1 (decreased by 1).
   - `_` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `cx` is an empty set.
   - `ax` is 1000000007.
   - `bx` is -1.
   - `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not affect the loop condition directly, but it is initialized to `n-1` before the loop starts. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 to allow the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and the initial value of `_`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`r` is a list, `t` is at least 1 (decreased by 1), `_` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `tmp` remains unchanged.**
