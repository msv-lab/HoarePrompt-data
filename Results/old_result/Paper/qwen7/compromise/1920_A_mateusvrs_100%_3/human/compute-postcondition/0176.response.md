Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in cx:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the set `cx` and the value of `i` is within the range defined by `bx` and `ax`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cx` is a set containing at least one `x` value.
   - `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.
   - `tmp` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from `cx` in each iteration, and `cx` is a set, each element in `cx` will be processed once.
   - After one iteration, `i` will be one of the values in `cx`. For the next iteration, `i` will take the next value from `cx`.
   - `cx` will lose the value of `i` that was just processed, meaning `cx` will now contain all the remaining values from the original set except for the one that was just used.

5. **New State**:
   - `cx` will now be a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used.
   - `i` will be the next value from the updated `cx`.
   - `tmp` will remain unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cx` is a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used, `i` is the next value from the updated `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1.**
