Postcondition: `r` is a list, `t` is at least 0, `_` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer (either 1 or not 1), `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of the original `ax` and `x`; otherwise, `cx` remains as a set containing `x`.
