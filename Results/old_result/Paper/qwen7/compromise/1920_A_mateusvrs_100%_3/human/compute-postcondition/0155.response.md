Output State: **`_` is 3, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `x` is assigned the value of the second integer input.**

In this output state, the values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variables `a` and `x` are updated to the values of the integers entered as input.
