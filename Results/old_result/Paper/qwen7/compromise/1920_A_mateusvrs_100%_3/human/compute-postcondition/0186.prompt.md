Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` remains undefined, `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is a list, `t` is at least 1, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values provided as input (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` is provided), `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (-1 if no valid `x` is provided). If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` contains 0. Otherwise, `r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their states after the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is a list containing either 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `t` is at least 0 and does not change during the loop, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique integers `x` entered during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of the smallest `x` entered and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all integers `x` entered, `a` is the last value read from input during the loop, `x` is the last value read from input during the loop, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` if `bx > ax`, otherwise `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is added to `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is `n`, `t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer provided initially, `cx` is a set containing all the `x` values that were added during the loop iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 2`), `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 1`), and either `r` is a list containing the value 0, or `r` has the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `cx` has been processed, `tmp` is equal to the size of the original `cx`, and `i` is the last value from `cx` that met the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
