Output State: **`r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `i` remains the same as after the third iteration, `ax` remains the same as after the third iteration, `bx` remains the same as after the third iteration, `tmp` remains the same as after all iterations of the loop.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. The values of `i`, `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their states after the third iteration of the loop.
