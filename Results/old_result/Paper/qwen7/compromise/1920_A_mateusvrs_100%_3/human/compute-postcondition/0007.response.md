Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `_` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `_` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `_` is 0, it does not affect the loop's execution directly (it will be incremented within the loop).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1**
