Output State: **`_` is `n`, `t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer provided initially, `cx` is a set containing all the `x` values that were added during the loop iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 2`), `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 1`), and `r` is a list containing the value 0.**

The code `r.append(0)` appends the value 0 to the list `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
