Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes variables to store the constraints and process them.
2. It handles the constraints of type 1, 2, and 3 appropriately:
   - For type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` (maximum lower bound).
   - For type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` (minimum upper bound).
   - For type 3 (`k != x`), it adds the value to a set `cx`.
3. After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If so, it calculates the number of valid `k` values as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. Otherwise, it returns 0.
4. The logic ensures that the constraints are handled correctly and the output matches the expected results from the examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
