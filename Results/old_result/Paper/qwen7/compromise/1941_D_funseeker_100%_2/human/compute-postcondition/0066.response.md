Output State: **`ans` is equal to (`q - r`) % `n`, `temp` is an empty set, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`**

Explanation: The line `temp = set()` changes the value of `temp` from a list containing three elements, which are (`q - r`) % `n`, to an empty set. The other variables remain unchanged.
