Postcondition: `ans` is not an empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing one element which is `(q + r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`, and if `c` is either '0' or '?', then `c` remains unchanged; otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.
