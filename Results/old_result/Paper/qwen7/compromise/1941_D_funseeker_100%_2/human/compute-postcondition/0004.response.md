Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first element returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second element returned by `func_1().split()`**.

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts the first element returned by `func_1().split()` from a string to an integer and assigns it back to `r`. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
