Postcondition: `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws. If `0` is in `ans`, then after the execution of the if statement, `ans` will include the position `n`. If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged and still contains all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws.
