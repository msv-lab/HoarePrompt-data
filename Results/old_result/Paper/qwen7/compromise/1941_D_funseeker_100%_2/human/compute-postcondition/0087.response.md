Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, `q` is the third element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q - r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` previously contained the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, adding `(q - r) % n` again does not change the set because sets do not allow duplicate elements. Therefore, `temp` now contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
