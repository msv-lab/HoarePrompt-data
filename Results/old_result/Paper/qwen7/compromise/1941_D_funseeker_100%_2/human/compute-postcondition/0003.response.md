Output State: **`r` is the first element returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second element returned by `func_1().split()`**.

Explanation: The code splits the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts using the default delimiter (which is usually a whitespace). The first part is assigned to `r` and the second part is assigned to `c`. The exact values of `r` and `c` depend on what `func_1()` returns, but they are now the first and second elements of the resulting list from the split operation.
