Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` is a non-empty set, `temp` contains a series of elements based on the operations performed within the loop, `r` is an integer, and `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` with possible values of '0', '1', or '?'.

Explanation:**
- The variable `ans` starts as a non-empty set and remains so throughout the loop's execution because the loop continues to iterate over the elements of `ans`.
- The variable `temp` accumulates elements based on the conditions inside the loop. For each iteration, if `c` is '1' or '?', both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` are added to `temp`. If `c` is '0', only `(q + r) % n` is added. Since the loop iterates through all elements of `ans`, `temp` will contain a comprehensive set of these computed values.
- The variable `r` remains an integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `c` is determined by the result of `func_1()`, which can return '0', '1', or '?'. The exact value depends on the function's implementation and input.**

This output state reflects the final condition of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
