Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` initially contained either one or two elements, it now contains one additional element, which is `(q + r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
