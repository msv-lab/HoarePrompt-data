Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element; `temp` contains an element which is `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the `temp` set, which is the result of `(q + r) % n`. Since `ans` must contain at least one element before the code execution, its state remains unchanged. The `temp` set now includes the new element calculated from the given expression.
