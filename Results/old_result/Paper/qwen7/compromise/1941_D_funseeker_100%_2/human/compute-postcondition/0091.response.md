Output State: **`ans` is equal to `temp`, `temp` contains a series of elements based on the operations performed within the loop, `r` is an integer, and `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` with possible values of '0', '1', or '?'.**

In this case, the line of code `ans = temp` simply assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. This means that whatever elements `temp` contained after the loop, `ans` now holds those same elements. The values of `r` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
