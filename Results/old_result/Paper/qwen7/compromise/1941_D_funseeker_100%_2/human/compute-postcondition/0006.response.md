Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `q` and the iterable `ans`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `r` is an integer value of the first element returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `c` is the second element returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `temp` is an empty set.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `ans`. The variable `q` will take each element from `ans` one by one during each iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `q` is the variable that iterates over `ans`, `ans` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - There are no direct adjustments needed for `r` and `c` since they are not used within the loop head.
   - `temp` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so its state does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `ans` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` must contain at least one element**
