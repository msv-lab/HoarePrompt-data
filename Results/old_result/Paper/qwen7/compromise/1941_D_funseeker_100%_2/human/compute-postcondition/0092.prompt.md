Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, and `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` contains all elements it was initialized with, `temp` is equal to `ans`, and `c` is either '1' or '?' for all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is equal to (`q - r`) % `n`, and `temp` contains three elements which are (`q - r`) % `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is equal to `temp`, `temp` contains a series of elements based on the operations performed within the loop, `r` is an integer, and `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` with possible values of '0', '1', or '?'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
