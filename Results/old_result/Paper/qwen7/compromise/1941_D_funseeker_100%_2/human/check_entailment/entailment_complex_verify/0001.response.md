### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) are correctly implemented and do not affect the correctness of the main logic. This part of the original assessment is accurate.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If the direction is '0' or '?', it calculates the new position by adding `r` to the current player's position modulo `n`.
   - If the direction is '1' or '?', it calculates the new position by subtracting `r` from the current player's position modulo `n`.
   - The set `ans` is updated with these new positions.
   - After processing all throws, it handles the special case where the player number could wrap around to 0 by adding `n` to the set if 0 is present.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and lists them in sorted order.

   The original assessment accurately describes the main logic and its correctness.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the ball could wrap around to the last player (when 0 is in the set).
   - The use of sets ensures that all players are unique.
   - The logic for updating the set `ans` correctly accounts for both clockwise and counterclockwise directions, including the '?' case which allows for both possibilities.

   The original assessment correctly identifies these edge cases and how they are handled.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the number of players who could have the ball followed by their numbers in sorted order, which matches the required format.

   The original assessment correctly notes this aspect of the program.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the program's logic, edge cases, and output format. There are no inaccuracies in the original assessment.

### Final:
**True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the original assessment.
