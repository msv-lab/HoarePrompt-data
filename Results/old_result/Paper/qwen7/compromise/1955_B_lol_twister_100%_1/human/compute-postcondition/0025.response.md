Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `h` and the range `range(0, n)`. Therefore, the variables involved are `h` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `li` is a list with two elements: `a + k * c` and `a + k * c + d`.
   - `h` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `h` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `h` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `h` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1 (as it was initially).

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - The list `li` remains unchanged.
   - `h` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`li` is a list with two elements: `a + k * c` and `a + k * c + d`, `h` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
