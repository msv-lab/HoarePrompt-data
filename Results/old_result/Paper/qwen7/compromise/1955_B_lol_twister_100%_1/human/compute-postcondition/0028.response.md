Output State: `li` is a list with `n` elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, `a + k * c + d * 2`, ..., `a + k * c + d * (n-1)`. The value of `n` must be greater than 0.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `li` will contain `n` elements where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The initial conditions require that `n` must be greater than 0.
