Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `h` is 2, `li` is a list containing the values [a, a + d, a + 2d], `li` is now [a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 2d].**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `k` is 0 and `h` is 2, the value being appended is `a + 0 * c + d * 2`, which simplifies to `a + 2d`. Therefore, the list `li` is updated to include this new value.
