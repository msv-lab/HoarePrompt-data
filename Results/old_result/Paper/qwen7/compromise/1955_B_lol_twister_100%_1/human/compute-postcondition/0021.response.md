Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `h` and the expression `range(0, n)`.
   - `h` is the loop variable.
   - `n` is used as the upper limit of the range.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Loop Variable**: The loop variable `h` starts from 0 (as specified in `range(0, n)`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `h` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `li` is a list of `n` elements, but since it is not directly involved in the loop condition or loop variable, it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `a`, `c`, and `d` retain their values, so they don't need to be adjusted either.
   - `k` is set to `n`, which is consistent with the upper limit of the range in the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `h` should start from 0.
- `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`h` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
