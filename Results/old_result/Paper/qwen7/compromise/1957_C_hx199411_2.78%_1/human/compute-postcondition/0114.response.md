Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is False
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `num` is either 1 or 2
   - `i` is 0
   - `c` is an input integer
   - `r` is an input integer
   - `num` is set to 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is set to 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains False (since the loop condition does not affect `t`).
   - `n` remains an input integer (unchanged).
   - `k` remains an input integer (unchanged).
   - `num` remains either 1 or 2 (unchanged).
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `c` remains an input integer (unchanged).
   - `r` remains an input integer (unchanged).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
