Based on the initial state and the provided calculations, we know the following:

- `i` is 6.
- `k` is 1.
- `c` and `r` are input integers but their values are not relevant to the print statement.
- `num` is the total number of inputs processed but its value is not needed for the print statement.
- `m` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, so `m` must be 6 since `i` is 6 and the loop has completed.
- `dp` is a list with the following values: `[1, 3, 8, 26, 114, 514]`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(dp[m])
```

Given that `m` is 6, we need to access the 6th element of the `dp` list. Since list indices start at 0, the 6th element corresponds to `dp[5]`.

From the initial state, we know that `dp[5] = 114`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **114**
