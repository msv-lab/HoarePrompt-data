Output State: `t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains False as it was never modified within the loop. The variable `n` and `k` also remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop. The variable `num` will have been incremented in each iteration of the loop, starting from 0 and ending at a value between `k` and `2*k` (inclusive), depending on the values of `c` and `r` in each iteration. The variable `i` will be `k-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `k-1`. The variables `c` and `r` will hold the last pair of integers read from the input during the last iteration of the loop.
