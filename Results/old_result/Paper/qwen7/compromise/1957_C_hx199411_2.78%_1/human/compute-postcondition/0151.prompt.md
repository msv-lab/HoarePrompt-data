You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each of the k moves you made are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two rooks (either yours or the computer's) share the same row or column after each of your k moves and their mirrored moves.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: t is False, n is an input integer, k is an input integer, num is an integer between 0 and 2*k, m is either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to 10000, c and r are input integers, dp is a list of m + 1 elements where each element is an integer, starting from 0 up to dp[m], with dp[1] being 1, dp[2] being 3, and each subsequent dp[i] for i from 3 to m calculated as (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where for each test case, it takes integers t, n, k, and lists of coordinates (r_i, c_i). It verifies that the conditions 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and that no two rooks share the same row or column after each move are met. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
