Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(3, m + 1):`
   - The relevant variables here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % 1000000007`, and `i` is 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 3` and goes up to `i = m`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, the loop will continue if `i < m`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must be greater than 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % 1000000007`, `i` is 5, `m` must be greater than 5**
