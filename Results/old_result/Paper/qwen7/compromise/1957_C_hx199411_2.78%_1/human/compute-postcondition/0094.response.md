Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(3, m + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `k` is 1 (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `c` and `r` are input integers (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `num` is the total number of inputs processed (not directly relevant to the loop head)
   - `m` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1 (relevant to the loop head)
   - `dp` is a list of 3 zeros with specific values (not directly relevant to the loop head)

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `m + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 5.
   - The value of `m` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition depends on `m` being greater than or equal to `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 5.
- `m` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `m` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, and it hasn't been explicitly changed in the previous iteration, we can assume its value remains unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 5, `k` is 1, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of 3 zeros with `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[3] = 8, `dp[4] = 26**
