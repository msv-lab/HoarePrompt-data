Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), inclusive.
   - `n` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant for the loop to execute).
   - `k` is an input integer (though its value is not directly relevant for the loop to execute, but it determines how many times the loop will run).
   - `num` is 0.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. Therefore, `i` must start from 0 and be incremented until it reaches `k`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should start from 0.
   - `k` must be a positive integer (since if `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), inclusive, `i` is 0, `k` must be a positive integer**.
