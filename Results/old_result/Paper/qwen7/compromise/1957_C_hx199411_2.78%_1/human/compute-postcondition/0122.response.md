Output State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 1, `num` is 4, `i` is 2, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2, so if `num` was initially either 2 or 3, after executing `num += 2`, `num` will be 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
