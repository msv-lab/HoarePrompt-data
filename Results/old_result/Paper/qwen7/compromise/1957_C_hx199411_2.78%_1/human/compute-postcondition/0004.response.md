Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, inclusive; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `num` is 0.**

The code initializes `num` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `num` is explicitly set to 0.
