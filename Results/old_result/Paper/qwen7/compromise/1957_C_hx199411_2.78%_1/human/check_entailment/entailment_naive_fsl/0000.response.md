Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic for calculating `num` is flawed. The variable `num` is supposed to count the number of unique positions (rows and columns) that have been occupied by rooks so far. However, the current implementation does not properly account for the fact that the computer's mirrored moves do not add new unique positions.

For example, consider the following input:
```
8 1
7 6
```
The program calculates `num` as follows:
- For the first move `(7, 6)`, `c != r`, so `num` is incremented by 2.
- The computer mirrors this move to `(6, 7)`, but this does not change `num`.

Thus, `num` is set to 2, which is incorrect because the computer's move should not increment `num` since it is just a mirrored move.

To fix this, the program should only increment `num` by 1 when `c != r`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c != r:
                num += 1
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
```

This corrected version ensures that `num` accurately counts the number of unique positions, and thus the calculation of the number of possible final configurations is correct.
