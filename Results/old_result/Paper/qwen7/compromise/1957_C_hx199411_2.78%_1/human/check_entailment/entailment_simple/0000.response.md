Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`. It also correctly processes the coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` for each of the `k` moves.

2. **Handling Symmetric Moves**: The program correctly identifies whether the move was symmetric (`c == r`) or not. If the move was symmetric, it increments `num` by 1; otherwise, it increments `num` by 2. This ensures that `num` counts the number of unique positions (considering symmetry).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**: The variable `m` is correctly calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining positions on the board that can still be occupied by rooks.

4. **Base Cases Handling**: The program handles the base cases correctly:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no positions left to place rooks, so the number of configurations is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one position left, and it can be occupied by either a white or black rook, resulting in 1 configuration.

5. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations. The array `dp` is initialized with base values and iteratively computed using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions without violating the constraints.

6. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that all calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
