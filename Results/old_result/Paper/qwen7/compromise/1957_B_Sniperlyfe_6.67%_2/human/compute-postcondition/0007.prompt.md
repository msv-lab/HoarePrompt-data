You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` test cases, `n` and `k` as specified, `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `2^k.bit_length() - 1`. After the loop executes, `k` is reduced by the value of `2^k.bit_length() - 1` for each iteration, but since `nums[i]` is assigned the same value in each iteration, `k` will eventually become less than `2^k.bit_length() - 1`, and the loop will stop when `k` is no longer positive. The final state of `nums` will be a list of `n` elements, each being the maximum possible value for the bit length of `k` before it became too small.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where each element is `2^k - 1`, except for the last element which is `2^k - 1 + k
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4 inclusive, and `k` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^9 inclusive. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where each element is `2^k - 1`, except for the last element which is `2^k - 1 + k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where each element is `2^k - 1`, except for the last element which is `2^k - 1 + k


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
