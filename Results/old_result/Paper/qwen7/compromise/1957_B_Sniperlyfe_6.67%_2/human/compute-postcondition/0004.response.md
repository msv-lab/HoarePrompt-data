Output State: **`t` test cases, `n` and `k` as specified, `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `2^k.bit_length() - 1`, and the last element of `nums` is increased by `k`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nums[-1] += k` increments the last element of the list `nums` by the value of `k`. All other elements of `nums` remain unchanged, and the values of `t` and `n` also remain unchanged. The bit length calculation and the loop condition described in the initial state are not directly impacted by this single line of code.
