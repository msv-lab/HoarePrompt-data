You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is set to the maximum possible value for the bit length of `k` (i.e., `2^k - 1`). In the last iteration, if `k` is still positive, it adds the remaining value of `k` to the last element of `nums`. The function then returns this list `nums`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the bitwise OR of the sequence can be maximized with a different distribution of values. Specifically, the current implementation sets each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest possible value with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits. This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The correct output should be `[1, 2]` because `1 | 2 = 3` and the binary representation of 3 is `11` (two 1s), which is the maximum possible. However, the current implementation would output `[3, 0]` because it sets each element to the largest possible value that fits within the bit length of `k`, which is `3` in this case. This results in a bitwise OR of `3 | 0 = 3`, but the binary representation of `3` is still `11` (two 1s), which is correct but not the optimal solution in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR across the entire sequence.

To fix this, the program needs to distribute the sum `k` among the elements in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence. One possible approach is to set most elements to 0 and one element to `k-1`, which will ensure that the bitwise OR includes all the 1s from the binary representation of `k-1`.
