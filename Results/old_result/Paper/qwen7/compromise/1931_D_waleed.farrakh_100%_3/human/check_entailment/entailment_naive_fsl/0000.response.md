Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Modulo Operations**: The solution uses modulo operations to check the conditions for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) being beautiful. Specifically, it checks if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Frequency Counting**: The solution maintains a frequency dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\). This helps in counting the number of valid pairs efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles the edge cases where the array might be empty or contain elements that do not form beautiful pairs. It correctly counts and returns the number of such pairs.

Given the examples provided and the logic implemented, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The `func_2` function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` appropriately.

Since the solution correctly implements the required logic and handles all the provided examples without any issues, the program is correct.
