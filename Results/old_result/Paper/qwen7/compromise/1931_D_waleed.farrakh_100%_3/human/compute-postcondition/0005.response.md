Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains `_` and `t`.
   - `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable and does not need to be explicitly adjusted.
   - `t` is the variable that determines how many times the loop will execute.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given state before the loop starts, `t` is the first integer from the list `data[0]`.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 (since `range(t)` will run from 0 to `t-1`). 

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and that `test_cases` remains an empty list since it is not used in the loop head.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `test_cases` remains an empty list.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `t` must be at least 1**
