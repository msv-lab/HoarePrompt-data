Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `t` is the first integer from the list `data[0]`, `idx` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `idx = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `idx`. The initial values of `test_cases` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, `test_cases` is still an empty list, `t` is still the first integer from the list `data[0]`, and `idx` is now 1.
