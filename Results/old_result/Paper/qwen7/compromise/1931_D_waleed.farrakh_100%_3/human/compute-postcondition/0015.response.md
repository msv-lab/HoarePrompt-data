Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The key variables here are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `test_cases` is a list containing two tuples [(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)]
   - `idx` is `idx + 4`
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `arr` is a list of integers converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and it was `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1 - 1 = t - 2`.

5. **Other states remain unchanged**: The other states (`test_cases`, `idx`, and `arr`) do not change based on the loop itself but rather on the loop body or external conditions.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples [(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)], `idx` is `idx + 4`, `t` is `t - 2`, `arr` is a list of integers converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`**
