Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with one fewer tuple), `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `count` is incremented by 1 if `(rx, ry)` (which is `(a % x, a % y)`) is already in `freq`, otherwise `count` is set to 1. `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third elements of the new first tuple in `test_cases` respectively. `arr` is a list with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where the key `(a % x, a % y)` is set to either `freq[rx, ry] + 1` or 1, and `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `ry` is `a % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list with at least two elements, `count` is incremented by 1 if `current_pair` is not in `freq`, otherwise `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[current_pair]` and then 1. `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `a % x, a % y`, `freq` is a dictionary where the key `(-a % x + x) % x` is set to either `freq[(-a % x + x) % x] + 1` or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` + 1 if `current_pair` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. `arr` is a list with at least one element, `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `a % x, a % y`, `freq` is a dictionary where the key `(-a % x + x) % x` is set to either `freq[(-a % x + x) % x] + 1` or 1, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
