Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `n` is undefined, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, and `results` is a list containing the sum of counts from each iteration of the loop.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The `test_cases` list is empty since it was processed entirely.
- The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are undefined as they were part of the input tuples in `test_cases` which are now exhausted.
- `arr` is an empty list because all elements from `test_cases` have been processed.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary as it no longer contains any frequency counts from the processed arrays.
- `count` is 0 because it accumulates the count of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq` for each iteration, and once all iterations are complete, there are no more counts to add.
- `results` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `count` from each iteration of the loop, reflecting the total count of valid pairs `(rx, ry)` across all provided test cases.
