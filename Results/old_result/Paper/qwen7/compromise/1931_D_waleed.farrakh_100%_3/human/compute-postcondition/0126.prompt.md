Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `rx` is (-`a` % `x` + `x`) % `x`, `ry` is `a` % `y`, and either `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 or `freq` is updated to include the key `current_pair` with value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is the next element in `arr`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `current_pair` is either updated to `(rx, ry)` if `current_pair` is in `freq` or set to `(a % x, a % y)` if it is not, `rx` is (`a` % `x`), `ry` is `a % y`, and `ry` is updated to `a % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the next element in `arr`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[current_pair]` if `current_pair` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is updated to `(a % x, a % y)`, and `ry` is updated to `a % y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
