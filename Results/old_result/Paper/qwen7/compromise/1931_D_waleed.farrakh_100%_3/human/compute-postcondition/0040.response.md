Output State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that is not empty, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the remaining elements of the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases` after all elements have been processed, `freq` is a dictionary containing counts of unique pairs `(a % x, a % y)` for each element `a` in `arr`, `current_pair` is updated to `(a % x, a % y)` for each element `a` in `arr`, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged, where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`. If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with a count of 1.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `arr` will be empty, `freq` will contain the frequency of all unique `(a % x, a % y)` pairs from the original `arr`, `count` will be the sum of the frequencies of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq`, and `rx` and `ry` will be calculated based on the current element `a` in each iteration.
