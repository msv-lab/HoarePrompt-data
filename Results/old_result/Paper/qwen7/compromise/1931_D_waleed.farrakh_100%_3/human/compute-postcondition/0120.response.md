Output State: **`a` is the next element in `arr`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `current_pair` is updated to `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, and `ry` is updated to `a % y`.**

Explanation: The line `current_pair = a % x, a % y` updates the `current_pair` variable to a new tuple consisting of `a % x` and `a % y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
