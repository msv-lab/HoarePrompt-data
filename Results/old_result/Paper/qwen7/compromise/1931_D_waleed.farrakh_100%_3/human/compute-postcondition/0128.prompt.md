Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in arr is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that is not empty, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of all unique `(a % x, a % y)` pairs from the original `arr`, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq`, where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` contains all elements from `test_cases`, `freq` is a dictionary mapping pairs `(a % x, a % y)` to their frequencies, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, `count` is the sum of the values associated with the pairs `(rx, ry)` in `freq`, plus 1 for each unique pair encountered during the loop, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third elements of the last tuple in `test_cases`, respectively, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered during the loop, `count` is the total sum of frequencies of pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y` for each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
