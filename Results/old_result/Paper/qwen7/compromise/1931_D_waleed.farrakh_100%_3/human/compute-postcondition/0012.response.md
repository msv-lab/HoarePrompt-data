Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple (n, x, y, arr), `idx` is `idx + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`**.

Explanation: The code snippet converts the string at `data[idx + 1]` into a list of integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigns it to `arr`. The values of `test_cases`, `idx`, and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states, but `arr` now holds the integer values split from `data[idx + 1]`.
