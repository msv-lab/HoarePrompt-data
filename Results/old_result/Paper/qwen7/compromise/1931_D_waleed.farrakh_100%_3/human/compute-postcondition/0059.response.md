Postcondition: `count` is incremented by 1 if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, where `rx = a % x` and `ry = a % y`. If `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`, `count` is set to 1. `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element, and `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`. `arr` is a list with at least one element, and `freq` is a dictionary. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, and `ry` is `a % y`.
