Output State: **`a` is the next element in `arr`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `rx` is (-`a` % `x` + `x`) % `x`, `ry` is `a` % `y`, and `ry` is updated to `a % y`.**

In this step, the code updates the value of `ry` to `a % y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
