Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each corresponding to the result of one iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\). If \(A\) is even and \(B \times 2 \geq C\), it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). Otherwise, it calculates \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) and prints \(X \times C + B\).

Each line's content depends on the specific values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) entered for that iteration.
