Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \(t\), \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). For each test case, it reads these integers and calculates one of three possible values based on specific conditions: if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\); if \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\); otherwise, it prints \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of integers corresponding to the calculated values for each test case.**
