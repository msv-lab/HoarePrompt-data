Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the `func` function matches the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - If the price of two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`B * 2`), it's cheaper to buy them individually at the regular price (`A * B`).
   - Otherwise, if the number of yogurts (`A`) is even, it's optimal to buy them in pairs at the promotion price (`A * C / 2`).
   - If the number of yogurts (`A`) is odd, it's optimal to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price (`(A // 2) * C + B`).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
   - It checks if \(B * 2 < C\):
     - If true, it prints \(A * B\), which aligns with the requirement to buy individually.
     - If false, it further checks if \(A\) is even:
       - If true, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\), which aligns with the requirement to buy in pairs.
       - If false, it calculates \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\), which also aligns with the requirement to buy as many pairs as possible and the remaining one at the regular price.

Given that the logic implemented in the program matches the problem requirements, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
