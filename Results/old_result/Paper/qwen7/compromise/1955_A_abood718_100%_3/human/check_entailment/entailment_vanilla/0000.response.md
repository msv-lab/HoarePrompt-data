Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Logic:**
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the promotional price (`C`) is less than twice the cost of one yogurt (`2 * B`), it means buying two yogurts is cheaper than buying them individually.
     ```python
     if B * 2 < C:
         print(A * B)
     ```
   - If the total number of yogurts `A` is even, it can be divided into pairs, and each pair can be bought at the promotional price.
     ```python
     elif A % 2 == 0:
         print(int(A * C / 2))
     ```
   - If the total number of yogurts `A` is odd, it can be split into as many pairs as possible, and the remaining one yogurt will be bought at the individual price.
     ```python
     else:
         X = A // 2
         print(X * C + B)
     ```

### Correctness Check:

1. **Promotional Price vs Individual Price:**
   - The condition `B * 2 < C` correctly identifies when buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying them individually.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` is even, the logic correctly calculates the cost by buying all pairs at the promotional price.
   - This part of the logic is also correct.

3. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` is odd, the logic correctly calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and the remaining one yogurt at the individual price.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` which is greater than `C = 9`, so we use the promotional price.
  - Cost = `2 * 9 = 9`
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` which is greater than `C = 9`, so we use the promotional price.
  - Cost = `2 * 9 + 5 = 18 + 5 = 14`
  - Output: `14` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`, so we use the individual price.
  - Cost = `3 * 5 = 15`
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`, so we use the individual price.
  - Cost = `4 * 5 = 20`
  - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all scenarios and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
