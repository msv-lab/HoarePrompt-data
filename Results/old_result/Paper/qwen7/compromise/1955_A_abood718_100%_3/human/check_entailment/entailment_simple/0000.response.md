### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, which are the required inputs.

2. **Promotion Logic**:
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`C`) is cheaper than buying them at the regular price (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so the program prints `A * B`.
     - Otherwise, it proceeds to check if the total number of yogurts `A` is even.
       - If `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the minimum cost when buying all yogurts in pairs.
       - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible and then adding the cost of the remaining yogurt. This is done by printing `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles both even and odd numbers of yogurts correctly.
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C:` ensures that the program uses the promotional price when it is beneficial.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
