Output State: The final value of `t` will be the same as the initial value of `t`. For each iteration of the loop, the variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` will change based on the input provided during that iteration. After all iterations, the value of `cost` calculated in the last iteration will be printed. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
