Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is equal to `max`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`
   - This means the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i < n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 1
   - Since `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to check if `i` is still less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which is now 2.

5. **Minimum Value Condition:**
   - The condition that the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is equal to `max` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop itself but rather by the loop body (which is omitted).

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
