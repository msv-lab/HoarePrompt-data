Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `max` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
