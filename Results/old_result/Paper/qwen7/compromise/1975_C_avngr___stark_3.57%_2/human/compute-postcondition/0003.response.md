Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
