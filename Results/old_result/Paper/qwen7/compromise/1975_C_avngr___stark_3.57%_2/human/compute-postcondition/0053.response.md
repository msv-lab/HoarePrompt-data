Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `max` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` must remain at least 2.

6. **Other states (`max`, `t`, and `a`) are not part of the loop head and do not change based on the loop itself**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `max` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input**.
