You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, it finds the maximum value among all the minimum values of consecutive elements (min(a[i], a[i-1])) in the list a. After processing all test cases, it outputs this maximum value for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the maximum possible value that the entire array can be reduced to using the given operations. The operations involve selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to the median of that subarray.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-1` and finds the minimum of each pair `(a[i], a[i-1])`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum of these minimums (`max`).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not actually use the operations described in the problem statement to reduce the array to a single value. Instead, it simply finds the maximum of the minimum adjacent pairs in the array.
   - This approach does not guarantee finding the correct maximum value that the array can be reduced to using the allowed operations.
   - The logic in the program does not account for the median operation or the ability to merge subarrays to achieve a uniform array.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case `[1, 2]`, the program correctly outputs `1` because the minimum of the pair `(1, 2)` is `1`.
   - For the second test case `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program outputs `4`, but this is not the correct result. The correct result should be `4` as per the problem statement, but the program's logic does not ensure this.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the required operations and logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
