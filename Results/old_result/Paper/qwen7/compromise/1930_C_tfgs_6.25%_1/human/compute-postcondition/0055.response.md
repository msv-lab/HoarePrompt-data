Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(adv)`. This means the loop will iterate over `j` from `0` to `adv-1`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
   - `a` and `j` retain their original values.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j`, the value of `j` will increase by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `ans` will be updated with a new element based on the new value of `j`.
   - The values of `a` and `j` will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, they retain their original values.

4. **Calculate the new state**:
   - The previous value of `j` was used to compute the new element for `ans`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new element added to `ans` will be `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1 = a[i - 1] - j - 2`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` will have a new element `a[i - 1] - j - 2`.
   - `a` retains its original value.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 2`, `a` retains its original value, `j` is `j + 1`**.
