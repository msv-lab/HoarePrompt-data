Output State: **The value of `a[i]` for each valid index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) is now sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new sorted list `a`, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. This means that the elements in `a` are rearranged such that they are in non-increasing order. The `counter` object, which counts the occurrences of each element in the original list `a`, remains unchanged because sorting does not affect the count of each element. The value of `n` also remains unchanged as it was not part of the operation.
