Output State: **`a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increases the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `i` must be less than `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described.
