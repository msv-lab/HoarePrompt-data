Output State: **`ans` now contains the elements `a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1`, `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `a` retains its original value; `j` is now `j + 3`.**

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the list `ans` will contain three elements: `a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1`, `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The variable `a` remains unchanged from its initial value, and the variable `j` is incremented by 3 compared to its value after 3 iterations.
