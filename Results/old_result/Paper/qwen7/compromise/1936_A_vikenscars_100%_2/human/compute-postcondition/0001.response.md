State: **`max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine Initial Values**: 
   - `max_item_idx` is initially 0.
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts with `i` in the range `1` to `n-1`).
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
4. **Adjust States**: 
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because if `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not start.
   - `i` should be set to 1 to match the start of the loop.

Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can start executing.
