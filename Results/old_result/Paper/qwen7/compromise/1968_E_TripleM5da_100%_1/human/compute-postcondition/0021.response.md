Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\). This means `t` can take any integer value from 1 to 50, but this value does not affect the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 8.
- `n` must be at least 9, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly given as 8, the print statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **8 8**
