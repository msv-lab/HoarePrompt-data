Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - The value of `i` is determined by `int(input())`, which means `i` will take the value input from the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `0` to `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a non-negative integer.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, it doesn't directly affect the loop's execution but provides a context.
   - The loop will run based on the input value, so we need to ensure that the input value is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that the input value (which determines the upper bound of the loop) is a non-negative integer. Since the loop starts from 0, the input value must be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it is a non-negative integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and the input value must be a non-negative integer**.
