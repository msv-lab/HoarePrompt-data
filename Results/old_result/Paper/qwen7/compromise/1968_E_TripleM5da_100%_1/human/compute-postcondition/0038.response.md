Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is equal to `n` + 1, `n` must be at least 13.

**Natural Language Description:** After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 50. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` + 1 because the loop increments `i` starting from 3 up to `n`. The variable `n` must be at least 13 for the loop to execute.
