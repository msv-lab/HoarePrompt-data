### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the examples given.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function reads a positive integer \( t \) and processes \( t \) subsequent integers \( n \).
   - For each \( n \), it prints pairs of numbers starting with \( (1, 1) \) and then \( (1, 2) \), followed by a sequence where the \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates are equal from \( (3, 3) \) to \( (n, n) \).
   - The function does not return any value.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program starts by printing two fixed points: \( (1, 1) \) and \( (1, 2) \).
   - Then, it prints pairs of the form \( (i, i) \) for \( i \) ranging from 3 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluation Against Examples**:
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The program prints:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       ```
     - This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The program prints:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       ```
     - This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which is incorrect because the optimal arrangement should include \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The program prints:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       ```
     - This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which is incorrect.
   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - The program prints:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       ```
     - This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which is incorrect.
   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - The program prints:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       7 7
       ```
     - This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which is incorrect.

From these observations, it is clear that the program does not always produce the maximum set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). The program only considers a subset of possible distances and does not explore all configurations that could potentially maximize \(\mathcal{H}\).

### Final Evaluation:

Given that the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \), the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
