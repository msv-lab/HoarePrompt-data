Postcondition: **`eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, inclusive, and for each `j` from 0 to n, `q[j] > 0`. `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, then `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `j` will be equal to `eta_ln`, `res` will be the sum of all the increments calculated in each iteration of the loop, and `rho` will be the cumulative sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values for each `j` from 0 to `eta_ln-1`.**
