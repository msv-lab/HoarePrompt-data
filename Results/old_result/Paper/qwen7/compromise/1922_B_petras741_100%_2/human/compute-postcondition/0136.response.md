Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Analyze the postcondition**: 
   - `j` is incremented by 1 (`j = j + 1`).
   - `eta` includes `j + 1` if `q[j]` is greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j + 1`, meaning `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - `eta` includes `j + 1` if `q[j]` was greater than 0.
   - `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - `eta` includes `j + 1` if `q[j]` was greater than 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `eta` includes `j + 1` if `q[j]` was greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**.
