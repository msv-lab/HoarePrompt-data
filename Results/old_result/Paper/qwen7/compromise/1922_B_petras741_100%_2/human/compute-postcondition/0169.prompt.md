Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n`, inclusive, and for each `j` from 0 to `n`, `q[j] > 0`. `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, then `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `j` will be equal to `eta_ln`, `res` will be the sum of all the increments calculated in each iteration of the loop, and `rho` will be the cumulative sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values for each `j` from 0 to `eta_ln-1`. If `n` is less than 3, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `buffer` remains a list containing integers from the input, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an input integer less than 3, and `w` remains a list of integers from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta_ln` is `n + 4`, `j` is `n + 4`, `res` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`, and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`. If `n` is less than 3, `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[0]]` and all `q[eta[j]]` for each iteration of the loop, where `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `j` is `n + eta_ln` and must be less than `eta_ln`, and `res` is the sum of all terms calculated in each iteration of the loop. If `n` is less than 3, `w`, `n`, `t`, and `i` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
