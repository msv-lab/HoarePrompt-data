Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, eta_ln):`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1.
   - `j` is `n + 1` and must be less than `eta_ln`.
   - `eta` contains all indices `i` from `0` to `n` where `q[i]` was greater than `0` during the loop's execution.
   - `res` is a computed value involving `q[eta[0]]`, `q[eta[j]]`, and other terms.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1` and `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n + 2`.
   - `eta_ln` must remain the same since it is determined by the length of `eta` and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be `n + 2`.
- `eta_ln` remains the same and must still be greater than 1.

The final state before the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `j` is `n + 2` and must be less than `eta_ln`, `eta` contains all indices `i` from `0` to `n` where `q[i]` was greater than `0` during the loop's execution, `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (`q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]])**
