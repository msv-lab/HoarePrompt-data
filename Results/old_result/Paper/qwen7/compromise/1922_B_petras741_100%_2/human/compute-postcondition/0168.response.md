Postcondition: **`w` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[0]]` and all `q[eta[j]]` for each iteration of the loop, where `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `j` is `n + eta_ln` and must be less than `eta_ln`, and `res` is the sum of all terms calculated in each iteration of the loop. If `n` is less than 3, `w`, `n`, `t`, and `i` retain their original values.**
