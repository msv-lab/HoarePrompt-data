Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) indicating the number of cases, followed by an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on the distribution of these integers. If \( n \geq 3 \), it computes a combinatorial value related to the frequency of unique integers in the list. If \( n < 3 \), it prints 0.**
