Output State: **`w` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `w`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.
