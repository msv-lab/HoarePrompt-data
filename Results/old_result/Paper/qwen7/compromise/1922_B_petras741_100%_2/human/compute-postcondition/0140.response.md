Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n + 1`, `eta` will contain all indices `i` from `0` to `n` (inclusive) where `q[i]` was greater than `0` during the loop's execution, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `0`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have been incremented to `n + 1` (since it starts at `n` and increments by 1 in each iteration). The list `eta` will contain all the indices `i` for which `q[i]` was found to be greater than `0` during the loop's execution. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than or equal to `0`.
