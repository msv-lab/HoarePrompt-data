Output State: `rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[0]]` and all `q[eta[j]]` for each iteration `j` from `0` to `eta_ln-1`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `j` is `n + eta_ln` and must be less than `eta_ln`, `eta` contains all indices `i` from `0` to `n` where `q[i]` was greater than `0` during the loop's execution, `res` is the sum of the following terms for each `j` from `0` to `eta_ln-1`:
- `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`
- `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`
- `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of `q[eta[0]]` and all `q[eta[j]]` up to the current iteration)`.

In simpler terms, `rho` accumulates the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values encountered during the loop, and `res` accumulates a series of calculations involving each `q[eta[j]]` value and the running total of `rho`.
