Postcondition: **`eta_ln` is `n + 4`, `j` is `n + 4`, `res` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`, and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- If `eta_ln` is 1, then `eta_ln` remains `n + 1`, `j` remains `n + 1`, and no changes occur to `res` or `rho`.
- Otherwise, `eta_ln` becomes `n + 4`, `j` becomes `n + 4`, `res` is updated by adding specific values based on `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`, and `rho` is also updated accordingly.
