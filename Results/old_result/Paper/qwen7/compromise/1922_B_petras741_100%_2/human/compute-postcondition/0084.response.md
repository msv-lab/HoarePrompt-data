Output State: **`eta_ln` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `rho` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code `rho = q[eta[0]]` assigns the value of `q[eta[0]]` to the variable `rho`. Given the initial state, `eta` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, all equal to `n`. Therefore, `eta[0]` is `n`, and since `q` is not defined in the initial state and no default value is provided, we assume `q[n]` is `n` based on typical usage patterns. Hence, `rho` is assigned the value `n`. The values of `eta_ln` and `j` remain unchanged.
