Output State: **`j` is added to `eta`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. The conditions for `j` being `n` and `q[j]` being greater than 0 remain unchanged. The value of `n` also remains the same as it was not affected by the operation.
