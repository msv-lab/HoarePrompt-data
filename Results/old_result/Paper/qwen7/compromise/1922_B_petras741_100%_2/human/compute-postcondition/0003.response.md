Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `buffer` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `buffer`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
