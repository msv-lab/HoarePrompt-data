Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain in their initial state, meaning no other variables are affected. Therefore, the only change is that `n` is now an integer input from the user.
