Output State: `w` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `j` is `n`, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `w[0]` in the list `w`, `q[w[4]]` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `w[4]` in the list `w`, and `q[w[j]]` (which is `q[w[n-1]]`) is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `w[n-1]` in the list `w`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`), and the list `q` will contain the count of how many times each index in the list `w` appears. Specifically, `q[k]` will hold the count of how many times the value `k` appears in the list `w`.
