Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `eta` includes `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `eta` is updated to include `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is currently `j + 1`, appending `j` to `eta` means that `eta` now includes `j + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
