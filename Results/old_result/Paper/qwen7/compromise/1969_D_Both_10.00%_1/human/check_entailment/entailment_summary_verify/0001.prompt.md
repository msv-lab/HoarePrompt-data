You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2

    4 2
    
    2 1 1 1
    
    4 2 3 2
    
    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. Both lists have the same length. It calculates and returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of the first element of each tuple in `main_ar` plus the second element of the tuple, but only if their sum is greater than or equal to zero.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` for input handling.
   - `func_1` returns an integer value from the input.
   - `func_2` returns a tuple of integers from the input.
   - These functions are not defined in the provided code snippet, but they are assumed to work correctly for reading input values.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads two lists of integers `a` and `b`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program defines `func_3` to calculate Alice's profit.
   - `func_3` takes two arguments: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - `main_ar` is expected to be the list of prices for Alice (`a`).
   - `sec_arr` is expected to be the list of prices for Bob (`b`).
   - The function calculates the sum of `val_a[0]` for all `val_a` in `sec_arr`, which is the total price Bob would pay if he bought all items from Alice.
   - It then iterates over `main_ar` and adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. This part seems incorrect because `val_b` is just an element from `b`, not a tuple with two elements.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The problem requires Alice to maximize her profit and Bob to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy involves selecting the best items for Alice to buy such that the difference between Bob's payment and Alice's cost is maximized.
   - The given function does not implement this logic correctly.

### Correctness Check

Given the analysis, the provided function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the optimal selection of items based on the given constraints and does not handle the scenario where Bob can take up to `k` items for free.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
