Output State: **`sub_summ` is `val_a[0]` + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]` + `val_a[0]`, `val_a` must be initialized, `sec_arr` must have at least two elements**

Explanation: The initial value of `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]` + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]`. After executing `sub_summ += val_a[0]`, `sub_summ` is updated to include an additional `val_a[0]`. Therefore, the new value of `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]` + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]` + `val_a[0]`. The conditions for `val_a` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
