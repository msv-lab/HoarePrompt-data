Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. Both lists have the same length. It returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of `val_b[1]` for all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the tuple's elements (`val_b[0] + val_b[1]`) is greater than or equal to 0.**
