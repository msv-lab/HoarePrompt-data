Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count`, `done` is either True or False depending on the condition `count > 1`, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` (if `count > 1`) or equal to 0 (otherwise).
