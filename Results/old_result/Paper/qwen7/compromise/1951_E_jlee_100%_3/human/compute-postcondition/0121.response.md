Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `j` is equal to `count + 1`.
   - `done` is True.
   - `count` is equal to `j`.
   - `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` if `count` > 1, or 0 otherwise.
   - There is a condition that if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j`.

2. **Understanding Variables:**
   - Since `j` is defined as `count + 1` and `count` is also equal to `j`, this implies that `j = count + 1` and `count = j`. Therefore, `j = count + 1` and `count = j` leads to `j = j + 1`, which is not possible unless `j` is 1 (since `count` would then be 1 and `j` would be 2, but this contradicts `count = j`). Hence, `j` must be 1 and `count` must be 1.
   - Given `j = 1` and `count = 1`, `count2` is 0 because `count` is not greater than 1.
   - The condition `s[j] != x and count < 1` does not apply since `count` is 1.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.
   - With `j = 1`, `string[:j]` will be the first character of the string `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the substring starting from the second character of the string `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string.

Output: **string[0], string[1:]**
