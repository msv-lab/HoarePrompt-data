Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, and if the value of `s[j]` is not equal to the value of `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]` is false, no changes occur to the variables.
