Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 1`, `done` is True, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1). If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
