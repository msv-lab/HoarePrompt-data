Postcondition: **`n`, `j`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `s` are as follows: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` equals `count + 2`, `done` remains True, `count` equals `j`. If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count2` is increased by 1. If `s[j] == x` or `count >= 1`, the loop breaks and `done` remains True. If `count2` is less than `count`, `count2` is increased by 1. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `done` remains True.**
