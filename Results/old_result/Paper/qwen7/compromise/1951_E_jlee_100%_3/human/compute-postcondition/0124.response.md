Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `j` is equal to `count + 1`.
- `done` is True.
- `count` is equal to `j`.
- `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1) or 0 (otherwise).
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j`.

The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
