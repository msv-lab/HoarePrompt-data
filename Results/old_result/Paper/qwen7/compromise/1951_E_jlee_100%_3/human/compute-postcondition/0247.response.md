Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, `count` was `j`, and the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`. If `count` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` is 0 and `count` is less than or equal to 1.**
