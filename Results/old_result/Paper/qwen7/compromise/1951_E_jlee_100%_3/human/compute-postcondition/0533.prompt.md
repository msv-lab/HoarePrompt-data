Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` is still False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `t-1`, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, `count2` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and either `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case `done` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. The current value of `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` remains unchanged and is either less than or equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is `s[0]`, `count` is 0, `count2` is either 0 or 1, and `done` is either False or True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is `s[1]`, `count` is 1, and `done` is True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` equals `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `count2` remains 0. If `s[j]` equals `x` and `count2` is equal to `count`, `count2` becomes 1. If `s[j]` equals `x` and `count2` is greater than `count` or `count` is greater than 1, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
