Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `done` is False, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

The code `done = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `done`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i`, `t`, `string`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
