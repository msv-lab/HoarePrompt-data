Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `s` is a string where the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`. This information is used to determine the value printed by the `print(1)` statement. Since the statement simply prints the integer `1`, it will print `1` regardless of the content of the string `s`.
