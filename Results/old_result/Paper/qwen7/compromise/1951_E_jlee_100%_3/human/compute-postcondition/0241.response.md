Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is greater than 1 and was equal to `j`.
- The character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.

The `print` statement is `print(string[:j - 1], string[j:])`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `string[:j - 1]` refers to the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
2. `string[j:]` refers to the substring starting from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

Given that the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact characters that will be printed. However, we know the indices and conditions that define these substrings.

Output: **[substring from start to j-1], [substring from j to the end of the string]**
