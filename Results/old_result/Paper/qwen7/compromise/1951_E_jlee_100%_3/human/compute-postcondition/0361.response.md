The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables are not affected by the `continue` statement. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`done` is False, `count` is `n-1`, `count2` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `t-1`, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`.**
