Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`; `done` is `True`.**

Explanation: The variable `done` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, or the elements of the list `s`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
