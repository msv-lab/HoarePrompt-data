Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 1`, `done` is True, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1). In both cases, `count2` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[j] != x` and `count < 1` is not met.**
