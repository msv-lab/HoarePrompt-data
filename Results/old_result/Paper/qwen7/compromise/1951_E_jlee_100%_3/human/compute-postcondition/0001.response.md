State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will iterate from `0` to `t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than `0`.
3. The variable `i` starts from `0` in the `range(t)` function, so before the loop starts, `i` should be `0` if the loop is to execute at least once.
4. Since the initial value of `i` is `0`, we can directly state that `i` is `1` at the start of the loop to ensure the loop body runs at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than `0` and `i` is `1` at the start of the loop.
