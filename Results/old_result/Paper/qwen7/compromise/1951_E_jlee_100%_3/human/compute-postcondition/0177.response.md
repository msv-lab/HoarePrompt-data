Postcondition: **`n`, `j`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `s` are as follows: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` equals `count + 2`, `done` remains True, `count` equals `j`, and `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1). If `count2` is less than `count`, the loop continues. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, the loop breaks and `done` remains True.**
