Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count`, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
