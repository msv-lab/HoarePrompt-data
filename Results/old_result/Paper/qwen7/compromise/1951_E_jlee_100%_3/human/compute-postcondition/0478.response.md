Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is `s[0]`
- `count` is 0
- `count2` remains unchanged and is either less than or equal to `count`
- `done` is True

The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

Let's break down the expression inside the print statement:

1. `string[:j]`: Since `j` is 0, this slice will return an empty string because it starts from the beginning of the string and goes up to (but not including) the index `j`, which is 0.
2. `string[j:]`: Since `j` is 0, this slice will return the entire string because it starts from the index `j` and goes to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'', string**
