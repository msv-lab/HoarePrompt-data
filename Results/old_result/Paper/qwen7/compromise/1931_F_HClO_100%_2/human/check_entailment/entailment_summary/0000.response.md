Reasoning:
1. The program aims to determine if there exists an order of participants such that all given screenshots can be obtained by inserting the respective author's position at the top of the list.
2. The program correctly handles the case where `m == 1` by printing 'yes' immediately.
3. For `m > 1`, the program compares the initial segments of the two lists (`l1` and `l2`) excluding the author's position from each screenshot.
4. If the segments do not match, the program prints 'no' and moves to the next test case.
5. The program then attempts to insert the author's position at the appropriate index in either `l1` or `l2` to match the remaining elements.
6. Additional elements from subsequent screenshots are checked against the modified list to ensure consistency.
7. The logic for handling the insertion and comparison seems sound and aligns with the problem description.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
