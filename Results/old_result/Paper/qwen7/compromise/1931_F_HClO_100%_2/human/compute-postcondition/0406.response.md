Postcondition: `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `idx1` is either the new value of `i + 1` if the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, or `i` if the condition is false, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were, and `n` remains unchanged. If the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
