Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, and `m` is 1; `a1` is the first integer from the input split and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes an input string split by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a1`. The rest of the elements are collected into a list `l1`. The values of `t`, `m`, and the original input for `n` remain unchanged.
