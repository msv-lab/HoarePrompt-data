Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing three tuples: (`a3`, `l3`), (original `a3` value, original `l3` list)**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` adds a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `a3` and `l3` are already defined in the initial state, they remain unchanged. The list `val` now contains two elements: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple `(a3, l3)`.
