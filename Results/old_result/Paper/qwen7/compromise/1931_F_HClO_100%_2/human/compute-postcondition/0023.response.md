Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is at least 5, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` is 4, a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used within a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next one. Since the loop had already run 3 times and `m` was set to be greater than 5, the loop will continue to increment `m` by 1 for each iteration until `m` is no longer greater than 3. However, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l22`, `l11`, `_`, and the new string input remain unchanged from their previous states.
