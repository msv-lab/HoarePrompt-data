Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; `idx2` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The line `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. No other changes are made to the variables `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, or the lists `l1` and `l2`. The conditions and relationships specified in the initial state remain unchanged except for the addition of `idx2` being equal to `i`.
