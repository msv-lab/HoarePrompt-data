Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both `-1` or one of them is set to the final value of `i + 1` and the other remains `-1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both `0` or one of them is `1` based on the last comparison inside the loop, and `i` has reached `n - 1` or the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is met, leading to a break.**

Explanation: The line `val = []` initializes an empty list for `val`. This operation does not affect any other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged.
