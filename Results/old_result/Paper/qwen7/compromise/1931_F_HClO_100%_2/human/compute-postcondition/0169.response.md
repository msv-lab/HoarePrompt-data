Output State: **`m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, and `l1` is a list of integers which are the remaining inputs after the first one.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input. It assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to the list `l1`. The values of `m`, `n`, `val`, and `t` remain unchanged from their preconditions, except that `m` is reduced by 2 due to the postcondition given.
