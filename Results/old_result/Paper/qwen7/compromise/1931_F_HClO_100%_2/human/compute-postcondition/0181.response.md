Based on the initial state provided:

- `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, meaning `m` must be at least 3.
- `val` is a list of tuples that must contain exactly `m - 2` tuples.
- The loop runs `m - 2` times, each time prompting the user for an input and storing it in the variable `input`.

Given the print statement:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
