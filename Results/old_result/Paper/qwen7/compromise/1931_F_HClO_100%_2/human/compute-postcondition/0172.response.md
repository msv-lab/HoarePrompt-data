Output State: **`m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer input by the user, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains only the elements of `l2` that are not equal to `a1`. The values of `m`, `n`, `val`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, and `a2` remain unchanged. The list `l22` is now updated based on the condition specified in the list comprehension.
