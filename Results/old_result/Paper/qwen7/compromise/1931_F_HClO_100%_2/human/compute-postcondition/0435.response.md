Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer with the value 2, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `l2` has had the element `a2` inserted at the index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the index `idx1`, which is `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
