Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, or `i`. It simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional statement we were inside.
