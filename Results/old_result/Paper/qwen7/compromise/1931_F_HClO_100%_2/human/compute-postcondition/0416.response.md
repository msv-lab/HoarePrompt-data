Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 based on the last comparison inside the loop, and `i` has reached `n - 1` or the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is met, leading to a break.**

Explanation: The line `idx2 = n - 2` simply updates the value of `idx2` to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
