Output State: **`m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer input by the user, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` that contains all elements from the list `l1` except for the element `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
