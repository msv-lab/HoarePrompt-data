Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, input() function waits for user input three times.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since the loop was defined such that it would run `m-2` times, and `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to run at least once, the loop will continue to prompt for user input three times. However, since the loop body itself does not modify any variables outside of the loop, the values of `m` and the condition for the loop remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
