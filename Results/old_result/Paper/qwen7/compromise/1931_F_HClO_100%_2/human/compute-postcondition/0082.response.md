Output State: **`idx2` is 2, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `idx2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The value of `n` and the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` remain unchanged, and since there is no else part, the postcondition remains that `n` must be at least 2. The value of `i` also remains 2.
