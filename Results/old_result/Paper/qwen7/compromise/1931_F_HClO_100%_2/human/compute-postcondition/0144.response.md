Output State: `m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from the input for each iteration, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input for each iteration, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` should be at least 4 (since the loop runs `m-2` times). For each of these `m-2` iterations, `a3` is the first integer read from the input, and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers. The list `val` will contain a tuple for each iteration, with the first element being `a3` and the second element being the list `l3` as it was at the start of that iteration.
