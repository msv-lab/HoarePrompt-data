Output State: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, and for each tuple, `l3` is exactly the list of all elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains only the elements from `l2` that are not equal to `a1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
