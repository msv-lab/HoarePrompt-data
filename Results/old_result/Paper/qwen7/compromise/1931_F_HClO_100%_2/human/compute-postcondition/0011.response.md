Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, and `m` is 1; `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from the original list `l1` except for `a2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
