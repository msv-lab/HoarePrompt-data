Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The values of `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 (if no matches were found that satisfied the conditions in the loop), or one of them will be 1 (if a match was found and the corresponding index was updated). The values of `idx1` and `idx2` will be updated to the indices where the conditions `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` were last satisfied, respectively. If no such indices were found, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain -1.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the end of the range defined by `n-1`. The variables `p1` and `p2` will indicate whether a specific condition was met during the loop's execution. The variables `idx1` and `idx2` will hold the indices where the specific conditions were last satisfied, or remain -1 if those conditions were never met.
