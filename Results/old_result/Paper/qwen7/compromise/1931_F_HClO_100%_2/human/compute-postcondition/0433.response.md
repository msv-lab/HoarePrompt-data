Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer with the value 2, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `l` is equal to `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
