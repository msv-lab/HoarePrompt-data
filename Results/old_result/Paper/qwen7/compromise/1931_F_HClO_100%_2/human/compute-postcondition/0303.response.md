Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple (`a3`, `l3`), `m` must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes the input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The variable `val` remains unchanged as it was already defined as a list containing a tuple with the initial values of `a3` and `l3`. The condition for `m` being greater than 1 is still valid.
