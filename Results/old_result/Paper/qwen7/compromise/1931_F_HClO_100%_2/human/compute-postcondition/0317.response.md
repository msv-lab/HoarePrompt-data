Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. At the start of the next iteration, `a3` is the next integer in the list and `l3` is the corresponding list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `val`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that the program will break out of the specified loop or conditional block.
