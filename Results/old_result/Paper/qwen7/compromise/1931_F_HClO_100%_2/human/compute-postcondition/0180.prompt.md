Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer input by the user, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, val is a list of tuples that must contain at least m - 2 tuples, input() is called but no value is assigned to any variable.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, val is a list of tuples that must contain at least `m - 1` tuples, input is taken from the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, `val` is a list of tuples that must contain at least `m - 1` tuples, an input value is taken from the user and stored in the variable `input`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
