Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 (if no matches were found that satisfied the conditions in the loop), or one of them will be 1 (if a match was found and the corresponding index was updated). The value of `idx1` will be updated to the index where the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` was last satisfied, and `idx2` is now `n - 2`. If no such indices were found, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain -1. `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than `idx2`; `l2` has `a2` inserted at the position specified by `idx1`.**

In this output state, the list `l2` has had the element `a2` inserted at the index `idx1`. All other variables retain their previous states unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.
