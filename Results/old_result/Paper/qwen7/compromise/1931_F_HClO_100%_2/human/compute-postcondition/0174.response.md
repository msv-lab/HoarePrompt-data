Output State: **`m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, val is a list of tuples that must contain at least m - 2 tuples, input() is called but no value is assigned to any variable.**

The `input()` function is called but does not assign the input value to any variable. Therefore, the conditions and lists from the initial state remain unchanged.
