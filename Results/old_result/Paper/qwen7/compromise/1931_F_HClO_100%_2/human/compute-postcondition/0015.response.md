Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `m` is 1, `_` is 0, a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.**

Explanation: The `input()` function is called without any argument, which means it will take a string input from the user. However, the input is not assigned to any variable, so the values of the existing variables remain unchanged. The new input is just read but not utilized in the current context.
