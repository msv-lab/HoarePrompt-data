Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `n`, `i`, and `p1`, `p2` remain unchanged.
