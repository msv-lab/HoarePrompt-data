Postcondition: `val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. After executing the if-else block, if the current state of `l3` does not contain all elements of `l` that are not equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` is false, the postcondition remains unchanged as there is no else part provided.
