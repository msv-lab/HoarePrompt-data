Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `idx1` is `i + 1`, `idx2` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. The values of `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of these variables along with the information that the `break` statement has been executed.
