Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than `idx2`; `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. Given the initial conditions, `idx1` can be either `-1` or `n - 2`. Since `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `idx2` can be `n - 2` or another valid index greater than `idx1`. The values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, and the relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged.
