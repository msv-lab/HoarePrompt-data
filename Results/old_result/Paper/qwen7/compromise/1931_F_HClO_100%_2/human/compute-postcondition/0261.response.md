Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `val` is an empty list.**

The code `idx2 = n - 2` assigns the value `n - 2` to the variable `idx2`. Since the initial state specified that `idx2` is not `-1` and the condition `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1` is satisfied, `idx2` is updated to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
