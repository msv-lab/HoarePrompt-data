Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing a single tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, and `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers. `l` is equal to `l2` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise it is equal to `l1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing all the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples (`a3`, `l3`), `m` must be greater than 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing three tuples: (`a3`, `l3`), (original `a3` value, original `l3` list)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
