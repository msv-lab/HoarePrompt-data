Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to the value of `i`. Since `i` was previously defined as `n - 1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are now also `n - 1`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
