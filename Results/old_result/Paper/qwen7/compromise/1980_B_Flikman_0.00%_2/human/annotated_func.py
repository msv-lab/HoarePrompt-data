#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `greater_count` will hold the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `same_value_count` will hold the total number of elements in list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. The variable `value` will not be defined outside the loop as it is a temporary variable used within the loop. The variable `t` will be decremented by the total number of elements processed in all iterations, `n`, `f`, and `k` will remain unchanged. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, if `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, `same_value_count` remains unchanged. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`, `same_value_count` is adjusted so that the total count of elements greater than `favorite_value` and those equal to `favorite_value` does not exceed `k`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), along with a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it determines whether there are at least \( k \) elements in the list \( a \) that are either greater than the \( f \)-th element or equal to it. If the number of such elements is at least \( k \), it prints 'YES'. If the number of such elements is less than \( k \), it prints 'NO'. In all other cases, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
