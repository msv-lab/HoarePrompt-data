Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `same_value_count` is 0, `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `value` is the last element in the list `a` that was compared during the loop execution, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `favorite_value` is equal to `a[f - 1]`
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `value` is the first element of the list `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 1. If `value` is not equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, and the variable `same_value_count` is incremented by 1 if the second element of the list `a` equals `favorite_value`. If the second element does not equal `favorite_value`, the value of `same_value_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `value` is the next element in the list `a`, and `same_value_count` is incremented by 1 if `value` equals `favorite_value`. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
