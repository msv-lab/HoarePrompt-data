Postcondition: `greater_count` is either 1 or 0, `same_value_count` remains equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, `value` is the first element in the list `a`, `t` is decreased by the total number of iterations (which is the length of list `a`), and `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged. `a` must have at least one element.
