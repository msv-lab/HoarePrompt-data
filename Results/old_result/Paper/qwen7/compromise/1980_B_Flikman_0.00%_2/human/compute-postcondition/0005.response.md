Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`, `same_value_count` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `same_value_count` to 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
