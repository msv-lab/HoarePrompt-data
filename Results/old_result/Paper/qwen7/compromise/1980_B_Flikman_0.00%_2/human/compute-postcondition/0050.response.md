Output State: **`greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is the total number of times an element in list `a` matches `favorite_value`, `value` is the last element in the list `a` that was compared during the loop execution, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The values of the other variables (`greater_count`, `same_value_count`, `value`, `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
