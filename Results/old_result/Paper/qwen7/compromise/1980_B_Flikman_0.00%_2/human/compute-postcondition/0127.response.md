Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each `value` in the list `a`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `value` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.
   - After the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `a` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on the list `a` having at least one element, for the loop to execute again, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `value` is updated during each iteration but does not affect the loop continuation directly.

4. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a`, ensuring it contains at least one element.
   - The variable `greater_count` is not directly affected by the loop continuation condition, so its state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `greater_count` remains unchanged**
