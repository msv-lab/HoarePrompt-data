Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is decreased by 1 as mentioned in the initial state. The variables `greater_count`, `same_value_count`, `value`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged. The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. Therefore, `n`, `f`, and `k` are now assigned the values of the input integers.
