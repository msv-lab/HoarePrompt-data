Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed based on the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
   - It then reads the values shown on the cubes.
   - It finds the value of the favorite cube.
   - It counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube.
   - It counts how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube.
3. Based on these counts, it determines whether the favorite cube will definitely be removed (`YES`), definitely not be removed (`NO`), or might be removed depending on the values of other cubes (`MAYBE`).

The logic implemented in the program matches the problem description accurately, so the program is correct.
