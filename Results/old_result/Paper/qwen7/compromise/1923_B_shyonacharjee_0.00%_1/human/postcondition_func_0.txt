The function processes a series of test cases, each involving a number of monsters with given positions and health points. For each test case, it calculates whether it is possible to defeat all monsters using a limited number of bullets, based on their positions and health. If it is possible to defeat all monsters within the given constraints, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.
