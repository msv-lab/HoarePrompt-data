Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is the position from `monsters[i]`, `health` is the health from `monsters[i]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position` from `monsters[i]`, `time_available` is `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`.**

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`, which is equal to `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
