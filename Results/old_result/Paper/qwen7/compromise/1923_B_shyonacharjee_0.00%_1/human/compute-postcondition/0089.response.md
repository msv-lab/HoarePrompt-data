Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `position` is the position from `monsters[i]`; `health` is the health from `monsters[i]`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position` from `monsters[i]`.**

The code calculates the distance between the current monster (`monsters[i]`) and a reference point, which is stored in the variable `distance`. This distance is the absolute value of the `position` of the current monster. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
