Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is incremented by `bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `i` is 4, `success` is False, `position` is assigned the value of `monsters[4][0]`, `health` is assigned the value of `monsters[4][1]`, `distance` is updated to the absolute value of `position`.**

Explanation: The code `distance = abs(position)` updates the value of `distance` to be the absolute value of `position`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
