Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is incremented by `bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `i` is 4, `success` is False, `position` is assigned the value of `monsters[4][0]` and `health` is assigned the value of `monsters[4][1]`**.

This means that the variables `position` and `health` are now holding the values from the tuple at index `4` in the `monsters` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
