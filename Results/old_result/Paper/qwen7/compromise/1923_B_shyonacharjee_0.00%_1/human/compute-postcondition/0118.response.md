Based on the initial state provided:

- `success` is `False`
- `i` is `n`
- `position` is `monsters[n][0]`
- `health` is `monsters[n][1]`
- `distance` is `abs(monsters[n][0])`
- `time_available` is `abs(monsters[n][0])`
- `bullets_needed` is `monsters[n][1]`
- `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES' if success else 'NO')
```

Given that `success` is `False`, the condition `if success` will evaluate to `False`. Therefore, the statement will print `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
