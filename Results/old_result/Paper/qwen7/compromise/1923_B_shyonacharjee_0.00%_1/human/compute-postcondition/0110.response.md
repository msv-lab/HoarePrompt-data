Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + monsters[n][1] + monsters[i][1]`**.

Explanation: The code `time_available = distance` updates the value of `time_available` to be equal to `distance`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
