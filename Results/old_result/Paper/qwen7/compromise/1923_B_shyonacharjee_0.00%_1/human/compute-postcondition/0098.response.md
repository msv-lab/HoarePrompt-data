Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `monsters[i][0]`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `monsters[i][0]`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + monsters[i][1]**.

This means that the `position` and `health` variables have been updated to the values of `monsters[i]`. The `distance` and `time_available` are both set to the absolute value of `monsters[i][0]`, which is the same as the original `distance` value. The `bullets_needed` is set to `monsters[i][1]`, and `total_bullets_used` is updated to `total_bullets_used + monsters[i][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
