Output State: **`success` is False, `position` is the position of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the `position`, `time_available` equals `distance`, `i` is `n-1`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `bullets_needed` for all iterations, `t` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values are assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The other variables (`success`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `i`, `total_bullets_used`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
