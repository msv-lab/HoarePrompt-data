Output State: **`success` is False, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the health of all monsters in the `monsters` list, `positions` is a list of integers, `healths` is a list of integers converted from input, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `n` is updated to the integer value of the first input, `k` is updated to the integer value of the second input, `i` is `n-2`, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, and `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list.**

This means that the `healths` list has been updated to contain integers converted from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `n` and `k`, which have been updated to the values of the first and second inputs respectively.
