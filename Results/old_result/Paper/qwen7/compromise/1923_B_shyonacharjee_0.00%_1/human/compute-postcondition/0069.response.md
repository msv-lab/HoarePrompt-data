Output State: **`success` is False, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `i` is 5, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `position` is now the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is now the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list.**

Explanation: The code `distance = abs(position)` calculates the absolute value of `position` and assigns it to `distance`. Since `position` was already set to the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is now the absolute value of that position. All other variables remain unchanged.
