Postcondition: `success` remains False, `total_bullets_used` is `bullets_needed`, `bullets_needed` is equal to the health of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `position` is the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, and `i` is 2, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` is true.
