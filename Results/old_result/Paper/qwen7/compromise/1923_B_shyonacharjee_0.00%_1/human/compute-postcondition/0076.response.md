Output State: **`success` remains False, `bullets_needed` equals `health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` equals `distance`, `i` is 5, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`.**

Explanation: The code `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increases the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`. Since `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `total_bullets_used` is now increased by `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
