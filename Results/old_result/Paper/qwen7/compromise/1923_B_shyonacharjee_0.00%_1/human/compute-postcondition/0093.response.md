Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is the position from `monsters[i]`, `health` is the health from `monsters[i]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position` from `monsters[i]`, `time_available` is `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`**.

Explanation: The line `success = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `success`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` remain unchanged from their initial states.
