Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that after firing bullets, the remaining monsters move towards the player. This movement needs to be considered in determining if the player can survive.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```
The program will incorrectly output `YES` because it does not simulate the movement of the monsters after the first second. However, after the first second, the 2nd and 3rd monsters will move closer to the player, and the player will not be able to kill them in time.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the sequence of events for each second, taking into account both the firing of bullets and the movement of monsters.
