Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` is the value of `l[x]`.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value of the list `l` at index `x` to the variable `b`. Since `x` is `n + 1`, `b` will be the value of `l[n + 1]`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
