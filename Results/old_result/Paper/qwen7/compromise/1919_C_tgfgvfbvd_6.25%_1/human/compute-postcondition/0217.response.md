Output State: **`c` is `1`, `y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1.**

The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was initially not defined in the given state, it is assumed to be 0 before the execution of the code. After executing `c += 1`, the value of `c` becomes 1. The conditions and values of `y`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them.
