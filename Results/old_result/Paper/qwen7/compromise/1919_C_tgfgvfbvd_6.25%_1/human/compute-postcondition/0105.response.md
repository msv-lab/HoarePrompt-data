Postcondition: **`y` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the element at index `y` in list `l` is equal to `b`, and the element at index `y - 1` in list `l` is less than the element at index `y` in list `l`. After executing the if-else block, if the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
