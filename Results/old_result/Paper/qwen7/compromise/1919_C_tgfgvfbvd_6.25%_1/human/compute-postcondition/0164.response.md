Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` is the element at index `n + 1` in list `l`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `x` (which is `n + 1`) in the list `l` to the variable `b`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `y` is still `n - 1`, `x` is still `n + 1`, and `b` is now the element at index `n + 1` in list `l`.
