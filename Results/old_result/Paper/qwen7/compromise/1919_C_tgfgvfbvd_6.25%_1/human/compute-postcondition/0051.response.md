Postcondition: `n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, then `l[x]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`.
