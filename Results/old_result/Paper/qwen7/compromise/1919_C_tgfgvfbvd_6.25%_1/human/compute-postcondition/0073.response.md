Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `y` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - `x` is `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for x in range(y + 1, n):
   ```

3. **Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `x = y + 1` and ends just before `x = n`.
   - Given `y = n - 1`, the loop starts with `x = (n - 1) + 1 = n` and ends just before `x = n`.

4. **Current Value of `x`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the current value of `x` in the next iteration would be `n`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `x = y + 1` and `y = n - 1`, the next value of `x` will be `n`.
   - `y` remains the same as it is defined outside the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is defined outside the loop.

6. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` is still greater than 3.
   - `y` is still equal to `n - 1`.
   - `x` will be `n` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is `n`**
