Postcondition: **`y` is a value such that after the loop runs, `y` will be `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`, and `l` is a list of elements. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, `a` is set to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` hold true, and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` is satisfied, then `l[x]` is updated to `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` hold true, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` do not hold true, `b` is set to the first element in the list `l` that is greater than or equal to either `a` or `b`. If no such element is found, `b` remains unchanged.**
