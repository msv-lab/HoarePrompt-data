Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for y in range(1, n):`. The objects involved here are `y` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `y` is initialized to the first value of the range, which is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `y` is less than `n`. 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `y` is set to 1 initially, it will enter the loop if `n` is greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Final state after adjustment**: We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1, and `y` is set to 1 (the starting value of the loop).

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `y` is 1**
