Output State: **`y` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` is `l[0]`, `c` is 0, `a` is `l[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits whatever loop or conditional block the code was inside. Since no new assignments or changes to variables are made within the `break` statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only impact is that the program breaks out of the current loop or conditional block.
