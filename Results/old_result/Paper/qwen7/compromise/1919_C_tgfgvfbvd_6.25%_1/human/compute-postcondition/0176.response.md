Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1` and `x` is `n + 1`. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `b` is the element at index `n` in list `l`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 and `b` is set to `a`. If `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `n + 1` in list `l`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` is set to the element at index `n` in list `l`.
