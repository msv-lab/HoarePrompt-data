Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `c` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial postconditions. The value of `c` is increased by 1, but the exact new value of `c` is not specified since it was already increased by 1 before this line of code. Therefore, the output state retains the relationships between `y`, `x`, and the updated `c`.
