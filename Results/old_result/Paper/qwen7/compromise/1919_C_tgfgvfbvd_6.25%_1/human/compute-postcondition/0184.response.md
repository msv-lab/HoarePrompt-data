Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` retains its last assigned value, `c` retains its last assigned value, `a` and `l` retain their final values from the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The values of `y`, `x`, `b`, `c`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged from their previous states.
