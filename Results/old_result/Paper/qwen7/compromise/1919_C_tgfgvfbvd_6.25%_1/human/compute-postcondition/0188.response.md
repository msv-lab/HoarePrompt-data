Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` is `0`, `c` is `0`, `a` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `c`. Since `c` was previously assigned a value (which could be anything), it is now explicitly set to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
