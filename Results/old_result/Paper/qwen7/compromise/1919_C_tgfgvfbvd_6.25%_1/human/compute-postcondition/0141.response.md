Postcondition: `y` is a value such that after the loop runs, `y` will be `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` hold true and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` is true, then `l[x]` is updated to `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` hold true and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]` is true, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` does not satisfy `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `b` is set to the first element in the list `l` that is greater than or equal to either `a` or `b`. If no such element is found, `b` remains unchanged.
