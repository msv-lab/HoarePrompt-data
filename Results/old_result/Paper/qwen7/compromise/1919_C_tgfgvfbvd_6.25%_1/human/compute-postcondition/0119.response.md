Postcondition: **`y` is a value such that after the loop runs, `y` will be `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`, `l` is a list of elements that can satisfy the condition for setting `b`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and greater than `b`, and the current value of `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`.**
