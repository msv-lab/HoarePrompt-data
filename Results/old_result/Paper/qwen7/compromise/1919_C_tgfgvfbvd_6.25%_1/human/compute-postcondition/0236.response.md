Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1, and `l[x]` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `l[x]` remains unchanged, `c` is set to `1`. Otherwise, if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`. Additionally, if the condition in the if statement is not met, then `l[x]` is equal to `a` and `a` is equal to `l[x]`, or `l[x]` is equal to `b` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.
