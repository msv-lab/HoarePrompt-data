Postcondition: `y` is a value such that after the loop runs, `y` will be `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`. If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `l` remains a list of elements that can satisfy the condition for setting `b`, with the current value of `l[x]` being greater than `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]` and `l` remains a list of elements that can satisfy the condition for setting `b`, with the current value of `l[x]` being greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`.
