Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` is `0`, `c` retains its last assigned value, `a` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `y`, `x`, `c`, `a`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
