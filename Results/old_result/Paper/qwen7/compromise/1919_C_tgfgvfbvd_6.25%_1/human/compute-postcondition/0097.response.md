Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is equal to `n-1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `c` is a non-negative integer, `a` is now `l[0]`, `b` is 0, and `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The line `b = 0` sets the variable `b` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables or the list `l`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `y`, `x`, `c`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
