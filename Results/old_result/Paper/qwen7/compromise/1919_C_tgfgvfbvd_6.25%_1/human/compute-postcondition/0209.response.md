Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `x`, `y`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `x` values starting from `y + 1` up to but not including `n`. This means `x` will take on values from `y + 1` to `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - **`y`**: The loop starts when `x` is set to `y + 1`. Therefore, `y` must be such that `y + 1` is within the valid range of `x`, which is from `y + 1` to `n - 1`. Since `y` is `n - 1` according to the postcondition, this condition is satisfied.
   - **`n`**: The loop requires `n` to be greater than 1, as per the postcondition. Also, `n` must be large enough so that `y + 1` (which is `n - 1 + 1 = n`) is less than `n`. This is already satisfied by the postcondition.
   - **`x`**: The initial value of `x` should be `y + 1`, which is `n - 1 + 1 = n`. However, since `x` starts from `y + 1`, the initial value of `x` should be `n - 1 + 1 = n`, but in the next iteration, it will be `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `y` is already given as `n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `x` should start from `y + 1`, which is `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `y` should be `n - 1`.
- `x` should start from `n - 1 + 1 = n`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1**
