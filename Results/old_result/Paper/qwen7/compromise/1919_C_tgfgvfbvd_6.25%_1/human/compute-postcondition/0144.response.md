Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `y` is a value such that after the loop runs, `y` will be `n - 1`.
   - `x` is `y + 1`.
   - `l` is a list of elements.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know the conditions under which certain operations are performed based on the values of `l[x]`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `y + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `y + 2`.
   - Since `y` is `n - 1`, `x` will be `n` in the next iteration.
   - However, the loop condition is `x in range(y + 1, n)`, which means `x` should be less than `n` for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be less than `n`.

5. **Updating States:**
   - `y` remains `n - 1`.
   - `x` is updated to `y + 2` (which is `n`).
   - `l` remains the same list of elements.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `y` remains `n - 1`.
- `x` is updated to `n` (since `x` needs to be less than `n` for the loop to continue).

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of elements**
