Postcondition: `count` is equal to `x`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `y` is an integer input from the user, `list0` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, and if `num` equals 1, then `count` is incremented to `x`.
