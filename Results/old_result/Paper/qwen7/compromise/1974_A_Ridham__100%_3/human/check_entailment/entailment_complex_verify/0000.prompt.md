You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\), considering certain conditions. The function then prints these calculated numbers of screens, one per line, for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the subsequent logic to determine the number of additional screens required do not accurately reflect the problem constraints.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
12 4
```

According to the problem description, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2. Each screen has 15 cells (5x3). The 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each, so 4 icons will occupy \(4 \times 4 = 16\) cells, which exceeds the capacity of a single screen. Therefore, we need at least 2 screens to accommodate these icons.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed. It first calculates the space required for the 2x2 icons and then tries to fit the 1x1 icons into the remaining space. This approach fails to account for the fact that the 2x2 icons cannot be split across screens, and it does not properly handle the case where the total number of cells required exceeds the available space.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of full screens needed for the 2x2 icons and then determining how many additional screens are required to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons
        full_screens_for_y = (y + 3) // 4
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * full_screens_for_y - (y * 4)
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_x = (x + remaining_cells - 1) // 15
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = full_screens_for_y + additional_screens_for_x
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens is calculated correctly based on the constraints of the problem.
