Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers where each element was originally a string in the set `nums`, and '0' is included.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts each element in the set `nums` to an integer using `map(int, nums)`, and then sorts these integers. Since '0' was added to the set `nums`, it remains in the list after conversion and sorting. The original set `nums` contained strings, but now `nums` is a list of sorted integers.
