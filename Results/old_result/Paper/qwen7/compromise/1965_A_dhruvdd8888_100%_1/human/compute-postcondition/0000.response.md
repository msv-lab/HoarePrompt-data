Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it. The value of `N` is an integer input from the user, constrained between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The precondition regarding the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and the constraints on `t` and `n` remain valid but are not directly affected by this line of code.
