Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies handling multiple test cases through a predefined structure where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to process a series of test cases, each containing a specific number of piles with a certain number of stones, and then perform some operation or return a specific result based on these inputs, though the exact operation is not detailed in the provided information.
