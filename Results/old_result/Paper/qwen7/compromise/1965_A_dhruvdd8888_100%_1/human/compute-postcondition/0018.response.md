Postcondition: `cw` is False, `nums` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `nums`, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`. This holds true regardless of whether the if condition `(cw)` is true or false, as the else part ensures `cw` remains False and the lists `nums` and `ls` retain their initial states.
