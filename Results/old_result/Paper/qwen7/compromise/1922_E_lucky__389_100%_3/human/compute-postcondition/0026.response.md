Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer and 2 ≤ x, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `i` is 0**

Explanation: The line `i = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. All other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and the initial value of `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
