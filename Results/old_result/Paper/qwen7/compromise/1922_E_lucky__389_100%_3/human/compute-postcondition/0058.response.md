Postcondition: **`mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i` - 1; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `x` is at least 15; `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values -1 and `i - 1`; `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x` - 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block. If `i` is 0, then `mx` remains 0, and `i` is still the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `mx` becomes the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, `subseq_lens` includes `i - 1`, and `i` is adjusted to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x - 1`.
