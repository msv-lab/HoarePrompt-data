Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 0 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `x` is not equal to 2, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their initial states.
