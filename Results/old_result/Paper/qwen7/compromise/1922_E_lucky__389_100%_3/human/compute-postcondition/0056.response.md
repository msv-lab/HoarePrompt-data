Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is at least 15, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values -1 and `i - 1`, `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x` - 1, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decreased by \(2^{(i-1)}\), which means `x` is now `x - 2^{(i-1)}`. Since `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x` and `x` was at least 16 before the operation, `x` is now at least 15. The values of `mx`, `t`, `subseq_lens`, and `i` remain unchanged.
