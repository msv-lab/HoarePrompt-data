Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value found among the values appended to `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i - 1` found during each iteration of the loop until `x` becomes 0, `i` is `len(subseq_lens)`, `len(subseq_lens)` is at least 3, and `ansv` is a list that now contains one additional element which is `subseq_lens[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ansv` has been updated to include the current value of `subseq_lens[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
