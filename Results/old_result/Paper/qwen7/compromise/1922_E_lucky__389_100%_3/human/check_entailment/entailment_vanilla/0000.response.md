### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a binary representation approach to construct such an array.

2. **Binary Representation Approach**:
   - For a given `X`, we need to find a way to represent `X` as a sum of powers of 2.
   - Each power of 2 corresponds to a position in the array where we place a value.
   - By placing values in these positions, we ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the binary representation of `X`.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the base case when `X = 2` by printing `[0]`.
   - It then iterates to find the binary representation of `X` using powers of 2.
   - The `subseq_lens` list stores the lengths of segments needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The `ansv` list is constructed based on these lengths, ensuring the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - Finally, the array is printed with the correct length and values.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case when `X = 2` by printing `[0]`.
   - For other values of `X`, the code constructs the array correctly by ensuring the number of increasing subsequences matches the binary representation of `X`.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct, with the first line containing the length of the array and subsequent lines containing the array elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
