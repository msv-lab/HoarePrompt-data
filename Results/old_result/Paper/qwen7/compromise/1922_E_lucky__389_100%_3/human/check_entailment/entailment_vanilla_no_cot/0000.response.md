Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array to have exactly `X` increasing subsequences is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Handling `X = 2`:** The program correctly handles the case where `X = 2` by printing `1` and `0`. However, this is not the only solution. For example, `[1]` also has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (`[]` and `[1]`).

2. **General Case:** The approach to construct the array using powers of 2 to represent the number of increasing subsequences is not correct. The program attempts to break down `X` into powers of 2, but it does not ensure that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

3. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle other edge cases properly. For instance, when `X` is a prime number or a number that cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, the program fails to provide a valid solution.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use combinatorial methods to construct the array. A more appropriate approach would involve generating a sequence that matches the binomial coefficients corresponding to the desired number of increasing subsequences.
