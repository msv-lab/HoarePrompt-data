Functionality: **The function processes a series of time inputs in 24-hour format and converts them to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It prints each converted time and the corresponding AM/PM designation. The function does not return any value but modifies the `day` variable to reflect the last conversion performed. The variable `n` keeps track of the number of time conversions executed.**
