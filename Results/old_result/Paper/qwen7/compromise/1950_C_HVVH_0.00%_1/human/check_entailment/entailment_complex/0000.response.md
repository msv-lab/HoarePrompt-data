Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The logic for converting the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format with AM/PM notation is mostly correct:
   - If `h` is 0, it correctly sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it correctly subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' before checking if `h` equals 12. This can lead to incorrect results when `h` is 12.
4. The `print` statement formats the output correctly, ensuring that both `h` and `m` have two digits.

However, there is an issue with the logic for determining `day`. Specifically, the condition `if h == 12: day = 'AM'` should be placed after the check `elif h > 12:` to ensure that `h` is set to 12 and `day` is correctly set to 'PM' when `h` is 12.

Here's the corrected logic:
```python
if h == 0:
    h = 12
    day = 'AM'
elif h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
else:
    if h == 12:
        day = 'AM'
    else:
        day = 'PM'
```

Since the provided program does not handle the case where `h` is 12 correctly, it will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
