Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, splitting the input string `s` into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
3. The logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format is mostly correct but has some issues:
   - For `h == 0`, it correctly converts to `12:00 AM`.
   - For `h > 12`, it correctly converts by subtracting 12 and setting `day` to `PM`.
   - However, for `h <= 12`, it incorrectly sets `day` to `PM` and then checks if `h == 12` to switch back to `AM`. This is unnecessary and incorrect because if `h` is already between 1 and 11, it should remain `AM`, and if `h` is 12, it should be `PM`.
4. The final print statement formats the hours and minutes correctly using f-strings and appends the appropriate AM/PM indicator.

To fix the issue, we need to simplify the logic for determining AM/PM:
- If `h` is 0, it should be converted to 12 and AM.
- If `h` is greater than 12, it should be converted by subtracting 12 and set to PM.
- Otherwise, it should directly use the hour and determine AM/PM based on whether `h` is 12 or not.

Here's the corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
            else:
                day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

Given the current logic and the provided example, the program does not handle the case where `h` is 12 correctly. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
