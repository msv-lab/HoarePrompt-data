Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 2Â·10^5), k (an integer between 1 and 10^9), PB and PS (integers between 1 and n), and two lists p and a (where p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n and a contains integers between 1 and 10^9). The function returns 'Bodya' if certain conditions are met, 'Sasha' if different conditions are met, or 'Draw' if no conditions are satisfied.**
