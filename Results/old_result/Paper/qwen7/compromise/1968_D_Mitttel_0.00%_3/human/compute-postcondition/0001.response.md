Output State: **`current_pos` is `start_pos`, `score` is 0, `n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer representing the duration of the game, `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of integers representing the array a.**

The code assigns the value of `start_pos` to `current_pos`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
