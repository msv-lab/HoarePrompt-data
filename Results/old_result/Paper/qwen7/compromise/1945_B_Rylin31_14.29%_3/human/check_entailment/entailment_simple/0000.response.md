Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. However, there are a few issues in the logic of the program that need to be addressed:

1. **Calculation of `mn`:**
   - The variable `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`. This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the actual timing when fireworks from both installations overlap. Instead, it should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

2. **Handling the LCM:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`. The LCM represents the interval at which both installations will launch fireworks at the same time.
   - The formula for the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` is `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.

3. **Counting Fireworks:**
   - The number of fireworks visible at any given time can be determined by counting how many multiples of `a` and `b` fit into the interval `[0, lcm(a, b))`.
   - The number of multiples of `a` in this interval is `lcm(a, b) // a`.
   - The number of multiples of `b` in this interval is `lcm(a, b) // b`.
   - The total number of fireworks visible simultaneously is the sum of these counts minus one (to avoid double-counting the common multiples).

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect. The correct approach involves calculating the LCM and then determining the number of fireworks visible based on this interval.

Correctness: **False**
