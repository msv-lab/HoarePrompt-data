Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in how it calculates the number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program uses `mn // a + mn // b` to calculate the number of fireworks from each installation, but this does not account for the overlap correctly. Specifically, it doesn't consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which is crucial for determining when fireworks from both installations coincide.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program incorrectly handles cases where `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`. It should handle these cases properly to avoid double-counting overlaps.

A correct approach would involve calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then using it to determine the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_visible = (lcm_ab // a) + (lcm_ab // b) - 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected function uses the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to ensure accurate calculation of the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
