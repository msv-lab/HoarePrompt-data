Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains either `(mn // a + mn // b + 1)` or `(mn // a + mn // b)`, depending on the conditions specified in the loop body. Here, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from user input for each iteration of the loop, with `t` being the total number of iterations. The value of `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, then the first expression is printed; otherwise, the second expression is printed.
