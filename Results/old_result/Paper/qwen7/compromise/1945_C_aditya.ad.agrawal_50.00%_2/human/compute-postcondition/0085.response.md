Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `pos` is increased by 1; `o_l` is increased by 1; `i` is not equal to 0**

Explanation: The line `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `arr` must still contain at least one element, `pos` is increased by 1 (as mentioned in the initial state), `o_l` is now one more than its previous value, and `i` is still not equal to 0.
