Output State: **`input_string` is the input received from the user, `t` is 1, `pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is 30001, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.**

The code simply assigns the value `30001` to the variable `b_d`, which was previously set to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos` at the last iteration. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
