Output State: **`t` must be a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers converted from each character in `input_string`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by converting each character in `input_string` to an integer. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. `input_string` remains a string input by the user.
