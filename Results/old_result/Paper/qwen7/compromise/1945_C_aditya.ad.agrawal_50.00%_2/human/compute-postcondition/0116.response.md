Output State: **`pos` is increased by 2, `ans` is equal to `pos`, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `o_l` is set to 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1; `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos` and assigns it to `b_d`. The values of `pos`, `ans`, `z_r`, `i`, `o_l`, and `o_r` remain unchanged from their initial state except that `b_d` is now set to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.
