Output State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`; `pos` is 1; `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0; `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`; `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b_d` to be the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`. Since `pos` is 1, `b_d` is now the absolute value of `n / 2 - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `b_d`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
