Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or unchanged, `o_l` is unchanged, `o_r` is unchanged, `ans` is `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)` is still true, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)` is still true, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos` adjusted by -1 or 0 depending on the value of `i`.
