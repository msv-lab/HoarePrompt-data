Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is increased by 1, `o_l` is unchanged, `o_r` is unchanged, `ans` is `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)`, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`**.

Explanation: The code `z_l += 1` increases the value of `z_l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
