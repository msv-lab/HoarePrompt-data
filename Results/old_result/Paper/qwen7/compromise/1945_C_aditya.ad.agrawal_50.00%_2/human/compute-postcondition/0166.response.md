Output State: **`i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `pos` was initially set to 2. The line `pos += 1` increments `pos` by 1, making its new value 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` is still the third element of `arr`, and `pos` is now 3.
