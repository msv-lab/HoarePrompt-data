Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is either `abs(n / 2) - b_d` or `abs(n / 2)`, depending on whether `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `ans` is 0, and `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is set to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_l` is decreased by 1 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, `ans` is `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)`, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or unchanged, `o_l` is unchanged, `o_r` is unchanged, `ans` is equal to `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)` is still true, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)` is still true, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true or false, the following conditions hold: `i` remains as the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 2, `z_l` either increases by 1 or stays the same, while `o_l`, `o_r`, and `z_r` remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is set to `pos`, and the conditions involving `o_r`, `z_l`, and `b_d` are preserved.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 3, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `o_l` and `o_r` may change by Â±1, `z_r` may decrease by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
