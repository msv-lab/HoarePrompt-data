Output State: **`ans` is 3, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 2 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` (which is 3) to `ans`. The values of `i` and `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r` remain unchanged from their initial conditions unless `i` equals 0, in which case `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 2 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.
