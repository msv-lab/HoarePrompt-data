`o_l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `o_l` is not specified, but since `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_r` is decreased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, the value of `o_r` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, `ans` is 1.**
