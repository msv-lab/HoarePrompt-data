Output State: **`t` is a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers converted from each character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`**.

The code simply assigns the current value of `o` to `o_r`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, and `z_r` remain unchanged, and `o_r` is now equal to `o`.
