Output State: **`pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is 1**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `pos` is increased by 1. After executing the line `z_l += 1`, the value of `z_l` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `pos` remains increased by 1 from its initial state. Therefore, `pos` is increased by 1 (from its initial state) plus 1 more due to the increment in `z_l`, making it increased by 2 in total.
