Output State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`; `pos` is 1; `o_l` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `o_l` is incremented by 1. Initially, `o_l` is not specified, but since no specific initial value is given, we assume it starts at 0. After executing `o_l += 1`, `o_l` becomes 1. The other variables (`i` and `pos`) remain unchanged.
