Postcondition: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 3, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `o_l` and `o_r` may change by Â±1, `z_r` may decrease by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts (though the else part does not change the postcondition in this case).
