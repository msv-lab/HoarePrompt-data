Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`**.

Explanation: The code `z_r = z` assigns the value of `z` to `z_r`. This means `z_r` now holds the same value as `z`, which is the count of 0s in the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, and `o` remain unchanged.
