Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `arr`, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the first element of `arr`.

3. **List `arr`**: The list `arr` is already defined and contains integers converted from each character in `input_string`. No adjustment is needed for `arr` itself, but we need to ensure that `i` is set to the first element.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `input_string`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, `pos`, and `b_d`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be the first element of `arr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`**
