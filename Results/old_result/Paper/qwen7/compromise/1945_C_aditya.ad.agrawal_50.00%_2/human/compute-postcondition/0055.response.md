Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 3, `z_l` is increased by at least 1, `o_l` and `o_r` may change, `z_r` may decrease by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.
