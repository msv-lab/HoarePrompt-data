State right before the while loop: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop condition is `t`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero.
3. Given the range of `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4), `t` being an integer within this range already ensures that `t` is non-zero.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be non-zero within the given range, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4**
