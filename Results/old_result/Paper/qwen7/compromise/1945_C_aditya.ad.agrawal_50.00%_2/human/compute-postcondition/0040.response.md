Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is increased by 1, `o_l` is unchanged, `o_r` is unchanged, `ans` is `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)` is still true, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)` is still true, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos` - 1.**

Explanation: The code `z_r -= 1` decreases the value of `z_r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `z_r` was previously part of the condition checking whether `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, and `o_r` remains unchanged, the condition still holds true. Similarly, since `z_l` was previously checked against `(z_l + o_l)`, and `o_l` remains unchanged, the condition for `z_l` also still holds true. The value of `b_d` is updated to reflect the new position of `pos`.
