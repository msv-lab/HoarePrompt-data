Output State: **`i` is 4; `ans[5]` is `ans[4] + ans[4]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 4, `ans[i + 1]` becomes `ans[5]`, and it is assigned the value of `ans[4] + ans[4]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
