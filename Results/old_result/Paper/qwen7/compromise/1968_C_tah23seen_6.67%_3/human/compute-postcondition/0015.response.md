Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 5
   - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`
   - `n` is the length of `arr` plus one
   - `ans[6]` is `ans[5] + ans[5]`

4. **Calculate `n`**: Since `n` is the length of `arr` plus one, let's denote the length of `arr` as `len(arr)`. Therefore, `n = len(arr) + 1`.

5. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 2`. Given `i = 5`, the condition becomes `5 < n - 2` or `7 < n`.

6. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `6`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 6
- `n` is the length of `arr` plus one (unchanged from the previous state)

Since `ans[1]` and `ans[6]` are derived values and not directly affected by the loop head variables, they remain unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 6, `n` is the length of `arr` plus one**
