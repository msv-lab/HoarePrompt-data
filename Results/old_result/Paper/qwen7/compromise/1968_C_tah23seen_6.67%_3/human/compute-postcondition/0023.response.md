Output State: `i` is 6; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. After the first iteration, `ans[8]` becomes `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`. Since `ans[8]` is now greater than `arr[7]`, the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is no longer satisfied, and the loop terminates. Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is `i` is 6; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`.
