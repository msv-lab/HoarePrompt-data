Output State: `i` is 5; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[6]` is `ans[5] + ans[5]`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n - 1`, which is 5 in this case (since `n` is the length of `arr` plus one). The value of `ans[1]` remains as the initial condition given, and the loop continues to update `ans[i + 1]` based on the previous value of `ans[i]` until the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is no longer satisfied. After 3 iterations, `ans[5]` becomes `ans[4] + ans[4]`. Since the loop continues to run, `ans[6]` will then be updated to `ans[5] + ans[5]`.
