Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 6.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` plus one, so `n = len(arr) + 1`.
   - `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`.
   - `ans[8]` is `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the values for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 6 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 7 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same, i.e., `n = len(arr) + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 7.
   - `n` remains `len(arr) + 1`.
   - The values of `ans[7]` and `ans[8]` are derived from the previous values but do not change for the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 7, `n` is the length of `arr` plus one, `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`, `ans[8]` is `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`**
