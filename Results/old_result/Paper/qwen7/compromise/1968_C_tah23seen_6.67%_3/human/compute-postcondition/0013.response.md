Output State: `i` is 5; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[6]` is `ans[5] + ans[5]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` and update `ans[i + 1]` as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. After three iterations, we know `i` is 4, and `ans[5]` is `ans[4] + ans[4]`. Since `ans[5]` is derived from `ans[4]`, and `ans[4]` was derived from `ans[3]`, and so on, we can deduce that each `ans[i]` is doubling the previous value of `ans[i-1]`. Therefore, after the fourth iteration (when `i` becomes 5), `ans[6]` will be `ans[5] + ans[5]`, which is twice the value of `ans[5]`.
