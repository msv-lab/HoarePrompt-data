Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is 2.
  - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`.
  - `n` is the length of `arr` plus one.
  - `ans[3]` is `ans[2] + ans[1]`.

### Loop Head Variables:
- The only variable involved in the loop condition is `ans[i + 1]`.

### Current Values:
- Since `i` is 2, `ans[i + 1]` refers to `ans[3]`.
- From the given information, `ans[3]` is `ans[2] + ans[1]`.

### Loop Condition Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `ans[3] <= arr[3]`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `ans[3]` must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`.

### Adjusting the State:
- We need to ensure that `ans[3]` is less than or equal to `arr[3]` for the loop to continue.
- Since `ans[3]` is already defined as `ans[2] + ans[1]`, we need to ensure that this value is less than or equal to `arr[3]`.

### Final State:
- The state needs to be adjusted such that `ans[3]` is less than or equal to `arr[3]`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: `i` is 2; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[3]` is `ans[2] + ans[1]` and `ans[3]` must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`**
