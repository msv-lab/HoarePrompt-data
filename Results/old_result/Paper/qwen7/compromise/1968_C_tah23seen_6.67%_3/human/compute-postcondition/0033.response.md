Output State: **`i` is 8; `ans[9]` is `ans[8] + ans[8]`; `ans[9]` is now `2 * ans[8]`; `arr[9]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[9]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates `ans[i + 1]`, which is `ans[9]` in this case, by adding `ans[i]`, which is `ans[8]`. Given that `ans[9]` was initially `ans[8] + ans[8]`, it now becomes `2 * ans[8]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
