Output State: **`i` is 7, `ans[8]` must satisfy `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6]) <= arr[8]`, `ans[8]` is `ans[7] + ans[7]`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given `i` is 7, `ans[i + 1]` becomes `ans[8]`, which is updated to `ans[7] + ans[7]`. The condition for `ans[8]` remains unchanged.
