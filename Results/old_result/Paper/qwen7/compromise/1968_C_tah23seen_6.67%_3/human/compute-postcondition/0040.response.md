Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[n - 1]` is `2^(n - 1) * arr[0]` and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`**

This means the program returns the list `ans` which contains two specific elements:
- The last element (`ans[n - 1]`) is calculated as `2` raised to the power of `(n - 1)` multiplied by the first element of the list `arr`.
- The second to last element (`ans[-1]`) is the sum of the third last element (`ans[-2]`) and the last element of the list `arr`.
