Postcondition: **`i` is 5; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[6]` is `ans[5] + ans[5]`.**

Explanation: Given the initial precondition and the behavior of the if statement, we can summarize the postcondition as follows. Initially, `i` is 1, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`, and `n` is the length of `arr` plus one. The if statement checks if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`. If true, `i` is incremented and `ans[i + 1]` is updated accordingly. This process continues until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than `arr[i + 1]`. After three iterations, `i` becomes 4, and `ans[5]` is set to `ans[4] + ans[4]`. Since each `ans[i]` doubles the previous value of `ans[i-1]`, `ans[6]` is then set to `ans[5] + ans[5]`, which is twice the value of `ans[5]`.
