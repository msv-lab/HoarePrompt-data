Output State: `i` is 8, `ans[9]` is `4 * ans[8]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. After the third iteration, `i` becomes 8, and `ans[9]` is updated to `2 * ans[8]`. If `arr[9]` is greater than or equal to `ans[9]`, the loop will continue. However, since we are asked to determine the state after all iterations, we assume the loop terminates when `ans[i + 1]` exceeds `arr[i + 1]`. At this point, `i` remains 8, and `ans[9]` is doubled from its previous value, resulting in `4 * ans[8]`.
