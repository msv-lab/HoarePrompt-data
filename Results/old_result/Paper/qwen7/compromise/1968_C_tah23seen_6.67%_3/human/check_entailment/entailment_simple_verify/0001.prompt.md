You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n - 2`. The value of `ans[n - 1]` will be `2^(n - 2) * ans[1]`, given the conditions of the loop. Since `ans[1]` is initially set to `arr[0] + ans[0]` and `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, we can express `ans[1]` as `2 * arr[0]`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final value of `ans[n - 1]` will be `2^(n - 2) * 2 * arr[0] = 2^(n - 1) * arr[0]`.
    #
    #The output state after all iterations of the loop will be: `i` is `n - 2`; `ans[n - 1]` is `2^(n - 1) * arr[0]`; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[n - 1]` is `2^(n - 1) * arr[0]` and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the array `ans` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.
   - It initializes `ans` with zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, ensuring `1 \le a_i \le 10^9`.
   - For each subsequent element, it calculates `ans[i+1]` using the formula `arr[i] + ans[i]` until `ans[i+1]` is greater than `arr[i+1]`. If `ans[i+1]` is less than `arr[i+1]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i+1]`.
   - Finally, it sets `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the generated array `ans` for each test case.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic of the function `func_1`:

- **Initialization:**
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that `a_1` is at least `arr[0] + 1`, satisfying the condition `1 \le a_i \le 10^9`.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `n-2` (since `ans[-1]` is handled separately).
  - `ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` ensures that `a_{i+1}` is at least `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
  - The while loop checks if `ans[i+1]` is still less than `arr[i+1]` and increments `ans[i+1]` by `ans[i]` until it is greater than or equal to `arr[i+1]`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.

- **Final Element:**
  - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` ensures that the last element of `ans` satisfies the condition `x_n = a_n \bmod a_{n-1}`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the function with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `arr = [2, 4, 1]`
  - Expected Output: `3 5 4 9`

  - `ans[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `ans[1] = 2 + 3 = 5` (since `5 \bmod 3 = 2`)
  - `ans[2] = 4 + 5 = 9` (since `9 \bmod 5 = 4`)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `arr = [1, 1]`
  - Expected Output: `2 5 11`

  - `ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3` (since `3 \bmod 2 = 1`)
  - `ans[2] = 1 + 3 = 4` (since `4 \bmod 3 = 1`)

  - Note: The expected output in the example is `2 5 11`, but the logic should be `2 3 4`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` seems to have a logical error in the way it handles the final element `ans[-1]`. The expected output for the second test case should be `2 3 4`, not `2 5 11`. However, the main issue is that the function does not ensure that `ans[i+1]` is always greater than `arr[i+1]` after the while loop, which might lead to incorrect results.

Given this, the function does not fully satisfy the problem constraints.
