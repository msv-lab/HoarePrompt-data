Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the array `ans` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.
   - It initializes `ans` with zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, ensuring `1 \le a_i \le 10^9`.
   - For each subsequent element, it calculates `ans[i+1]` using the formula `arr[i] + ans[i]` until `ans[i+1]` is greater than `arr[i+1]`. If `ans[i+1]` is less than `arr[i+1]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i+1]`.
   - Finally, it sets `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the generated array `ans` for each test case.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic of the function `func_1`:

- **Initialization:**
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that `a_1` is at least `arr[0] + 1`, satisfying the condition `1 \le a_i \le 10^9`.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `n-2` (since `ans[-1]` is handled separately).
  - `ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` ensures that `a_{i+1}` is at least `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
  - The while loop checks if `ans[i+1]` is still less than `arr[i+1]` and increments `ans[i+1]` by `ans[i]` until it is greater than or equal to `arr[i+1]`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.

- **Final Element:**
  - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` ensures that the last element of `ans` satisfies the condition `x_n = a_n \bmod a_{n-1}`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the function with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `arr = [2, 4, 1]`
  - Expected Output: `3 5 4 9`

  - `ans[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `ans[1] = 2 + 3 = 5` (since `5 \bmod 3 = 2`)
  - `ans[2] = 4 + 5 = 9` (since `9 \bmod 5 = 4`)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `arr = [1, 1]`
  - Expected Output: `2 5 11`

  - `ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3` (since `3 \bmod 2 = 1`)
  - `ans[2] = 1 + 3 = 4` (since `4 \bmod 3 = 1`)

  - Note: The expected output in the example is `2 5 11`, but the logic should be `2 3 4`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` seems to have a logical error in the way it handles the final element `ans[-1]`. The expected output for the second test case should be `2 3 4`, not `2 5 11`. However, the main issue is that the function does not ensure that `ans[i+1]` is always greater than `arr[i+1]` after the while loop, which might lead to incorrect results.

Given this, the function does not fully satisfy the problem constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
