Output State: **`d.get(i)` is 1, `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `d[i]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of `d[i]` to 1. Since `d.get(i)` was either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`), it remains 1 after this assignment. Additionally, `i` is added to `pl` if it was not already present.
