Output State: `shapes` is equal to the number of unique elements in `palka` whose count in `d` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `shapes` will be equal to the number of unique elements in `palka` whose count in the dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3. The dictionary `d` will hold the counts of each key from the list `palka`, and the list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, as no modifications are made to `pl` within the loop body other than appending new unique elements.
