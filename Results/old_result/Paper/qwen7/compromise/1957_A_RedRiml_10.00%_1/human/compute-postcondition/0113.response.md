Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer, and `d.get(i)` is now `d.get(i) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d.get(i)` by 1. Since `d.get(i)` is not None, it means that `d.get(i)` was already an integer (from the initial state). After executing the code, the value of `d.get(i)` is updated to its original value plus 1. The list `palka` and the condition that it contains at least one integer remain unchanged.
