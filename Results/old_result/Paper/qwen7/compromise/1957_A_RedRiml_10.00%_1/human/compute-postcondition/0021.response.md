Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list with at least two elements containing the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 for the next element of `palka` where `i` is the next element of `palka`**.

The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1, where `i` is the next element of `palka`. Since `i` is the next element of `palka`, the dictionary `d` will have its corresponding value incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
