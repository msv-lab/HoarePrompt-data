Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` remains greater than 0, `ln` remains unchanged, `palka` is a list of at least one integer (excluding the first element of the previous list), `pl` includes the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`, and for each `i` (the next element of `palka`), `d[i]` is set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, or incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`.
