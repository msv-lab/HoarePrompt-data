Output State: **`i` is the next element in `palka`, `next_i` is the same as `i`, `d[i]` is 1**.

This means that the dictionary `d` now has an entry where the key is the value of `i` (which is also the value of `next_i`), and the value associated with this key is `1`. All other variables remain in their initial state.
