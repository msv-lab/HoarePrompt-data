Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
