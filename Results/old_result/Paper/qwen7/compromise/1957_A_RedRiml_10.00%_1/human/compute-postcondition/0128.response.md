Postcondition: `d.get(i)` is either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`), `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`. If `i` was not in `pl` before the execution of the if statement, then `pl` now includes `i`.
