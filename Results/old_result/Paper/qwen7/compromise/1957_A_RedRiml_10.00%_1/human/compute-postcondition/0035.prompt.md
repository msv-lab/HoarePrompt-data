Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list with at least one element containing the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is set to `1` if `d.get(i)` was `None`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by `1`, where `i` is the first element of `palka`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `i` (the first element of `palka`) is not already in `pl`, then `pl` will contain `i` appended to it, and `d[i]` will be updated according to the rules specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change outside of appending `i` to `pl` and updating `d[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` remains greater than 0, `ln` remains unchanged, `palka` remains a list of at least one integer, `pl` now includes the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary where for each `i` (the next element of `palka`), `d[i]` is either set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, or incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` remains greater than 0, `ln` remains unchanged, `palka` is a list of at least one integer (excluding the first element of the previous list), `pl` includes the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`, and for each `i` (the next element of `palka`), `d[i]` is set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, or incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to include the next element of `palka`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
