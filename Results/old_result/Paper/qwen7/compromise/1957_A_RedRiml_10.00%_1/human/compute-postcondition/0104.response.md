Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, and `w` is decremented by 1, `palka` is updated to a list of integers based on user input.**

Explanation: The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The other variables (`shapes`, `d`, `pl`, `w`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The `palka` list is updated to reflect the new input values, and each element in `palka` is an integer.
