Postcondition: `d.get(i)` is either 1 or incremented by 1, `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`. After executing the if-else block, `d.get(i)` is either 1 or incremented by 1, `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `pl` now includes `i`.
