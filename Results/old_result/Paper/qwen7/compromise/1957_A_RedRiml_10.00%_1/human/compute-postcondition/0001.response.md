State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer**, `_` is not a variable that can be adjusted, so we focus on `w`.

For the loop to execute, the variable `w` must be at least 1. The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0**
