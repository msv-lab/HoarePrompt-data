Postcondition: `i` is an index in `palka`, `next_i` is the same as `i`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `palka` has the next element appended to it at index `i`, `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1, and `pl` now contains the next element in `palka` at index `i`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of whether `i` is in `pl` or not.
