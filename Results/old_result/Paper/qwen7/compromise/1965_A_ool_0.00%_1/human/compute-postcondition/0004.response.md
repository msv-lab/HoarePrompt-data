Output State: **`A` is False, and `arr[0]` is equal to 1, `set_` is [1]**

Explanation: The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` converts the list `arr` into a set to remove duplicates and then converts it back into a list. Since `arr[0]` is equal to 1 and assuming there are no other elements in `arr` that are 1 (or the same as 1), the set will contain only the element 1. Therefore, `set_` becomes a list containing the single element 1. The variables `A` and `arr[0]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
