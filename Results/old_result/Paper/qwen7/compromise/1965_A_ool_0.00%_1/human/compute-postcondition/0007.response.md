Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `set_`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (the start of the range).
   - `set_` is given as `[1]`.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `1 <= i < len(set_)` must be true.
   - Given `set_ = [1]`, the length of `set_` is 1.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `1 <= i < 1`, which simplifies to `1 <= i < 1`.
   - This condition is false because there is no value of `i` that satisfies `1 <= i < 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop cannot execute with the current state, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can potentially execute.
   - To make the loop execute, `len(set_)` must be greater than 1.
   - Hence, `set_` should have more than one element.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `set_` must have more than one element.
- `i` should be initialized to 1 (as per the loop definition).

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is True, `arr[0]` is equal to 1, `set_` is a set that must have more than one element, `i` is 1**
