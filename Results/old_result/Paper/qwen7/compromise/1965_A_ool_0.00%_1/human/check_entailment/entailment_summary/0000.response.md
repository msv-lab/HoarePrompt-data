Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem describes a game where players take turns removing a certain number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player unable to make a move losing. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the Grundy numbers or Nim-sums in combinatorial game theory, but the provided solution does not follow this approach.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` first checks if the smallest pile has exactly 1 stone. If not, it immediately returns 'Alice'.
   - If the smallest pile has 1 stone, it proceeds to check the sorted unique values in the array.
   - It then iterates through these unique values and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is never more than 1.
   - Based on this condition, it toggles a boolean variable `A`.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise 'Bob'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game's rules. Specifically, the game involves removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles simultaneously, and the outcome depends on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
   - The provided solution incorrectly handles the game's state and does not reflect the optimal strategy for determining the winner.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example input, the solution does not produce the correct results for all test cases. For instance, in the second test case, the output should be 'Alice' if both players play optimally, but the provided solution incorrectly outputs 'Bob'.

Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the game logic and does not follow the optimal strategy for determining the winner.

Correctness: **False**
