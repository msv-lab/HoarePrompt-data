The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of positive integers), and `s` (a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.
