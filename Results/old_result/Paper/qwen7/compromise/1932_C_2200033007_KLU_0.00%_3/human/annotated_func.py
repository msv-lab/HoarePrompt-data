#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, and s is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length n.

        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])

    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`, `b` is a list where elements from `a` are appended based on the direction indicated by `s`, `r` is -1.
    #
    #In the output state, the variable `b` will contain elements from the list `a`. The elements are appended to `b` based on the direction specified by each character in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the element at index `l` in `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', the element at index `r` in `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented. After all iterations, `l` remains 0 because it is only incremented and `r` is decremented until it becomes -1.

    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` based on directions in `s`, `p` is the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of positive integers), and `s` (a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.
