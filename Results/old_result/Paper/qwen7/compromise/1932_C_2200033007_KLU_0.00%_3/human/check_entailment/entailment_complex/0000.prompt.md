Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

    3 1 4 2
    
    LRRL
    
    5 1

    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, and s is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length n.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`, `b` is a list where elements from `a` are appended based on the direction indicated by `s`, `r` is -1.
    #
    #In the output state, the variable `b` will contain elements from the list `a`. The elements are appended to `b` based on the direction specified by each character in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the element at index `l` in `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', the element at index `r` in `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented. After all iterations, `l` remains 0 because it is only incremented and `r` is decremented until it becomes -1.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`, `b` is a list of elements from `a` based on directions in `s`, `p` is the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of positive integers), and `s` (a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.
