Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly processes the commands as per the problem statement.
- The function `func_1` takes the parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` and performs the following steps:
  1. Constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`.
  2. Calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order.
  3. Returns the cumulative product list in reverse order.
- The logic for constructing the list `b` is correct. It appends elements from `a` to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
- The calculation of the cumulative product in reverse order is also correct. It iterates over the list `b` in reverse and calculates the cumulative product.
- The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem requirements and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
