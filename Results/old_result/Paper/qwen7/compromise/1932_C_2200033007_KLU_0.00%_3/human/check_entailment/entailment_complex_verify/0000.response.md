### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` and two pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array `a` from both ends.
   - It constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`.
   - After constructing `b`, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and appends these products to the list `ans`.

2. **Key Issues:**
   - The function does not perform the required modulo operation on the product of the elements of the array `a` before appending the result to `ans`.
   - The function constructs `b` by simply appending elements from `a` without considering the modulo operation.
   - The function then calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and appends these products to `ans`.

#### Corrected Version of `func_1`:

The original assessment suggests a corrected version of `func_1` that performs the modulo operation at each step:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            p = (p * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            p = (p * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        b.append(p)
    return b
```

This corrected version ensures that the product of the remaining elements is computed modulo `m` at each step, which matches the problem description.

#### Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `n` is a positive integer.
  - `m` is a positive integer.
  - `a` is a list of positive integers.
  - `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`.

- **After Constructing `b`:**
  - `b` contains elements from `a` based on the directions in `s`.
  - `l` is 0.
  - `r` is -1.
  - `p` is the product of the remaining elements in `b` modulo `m`.

- **After Calculating Cumulative Product:**
  - `ans` contains the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order modulo `m`.

Given the corrected version of `func_1`, the program now correctly computes and outputs the remainders of the products as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description, and the corrected version provided in the original assessment fixes this issue.

**Final: True**
