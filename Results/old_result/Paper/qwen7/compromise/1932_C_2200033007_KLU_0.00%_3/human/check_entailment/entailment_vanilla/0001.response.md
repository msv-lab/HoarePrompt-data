Reasoning:

1. The provided program has a function `func_1` which processes the commands and calculates the required remainders.
2. The main loop iterates over the test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
3. The `func_1` function is supposed to:
   - Traverse the string `s` and collect the elements of the array `a` in the order specified by `s`.
   - Calculate the product of the collected elements modulo `m` and store these results in a list `ans`.
4. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect:
   - It appends elements to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R', but it does not actually perform the operations as described in the problem statement.
   - It should calculate the product of the remaining elements of `a` after each command, not just append elements.
   - The final result should be the remainders of these products, not the products themselves.
5. The main program calls `func_1` with the parameters and prints the results, but `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the remainders of the product of the array elements after each command.

Correctness: **False**
