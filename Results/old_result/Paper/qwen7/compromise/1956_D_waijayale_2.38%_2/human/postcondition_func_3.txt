The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then calls another function `func_2` to compute values `s` and `m`, and a list `ops`. It prints `s` and `m`, and subsequently prints each pair `(l+1, r+1)` for every `(l, r)` in `ops`. The final output consists of multiple lines, each containing two integers separated by a space.
