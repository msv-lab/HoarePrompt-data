Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but an implied input 'n' (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list 'a' of 'n' integers where each integer 'a_i' satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. It returns a value based on the input list 'a'.**

This means the function `func_3` does not directly accept any parameters when called. Instead, it seems to work with an implied input `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes the list `a` and returns a value based on the contents of this list.
