Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_2(a)` with the list `a` as an argument. The function returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. These values are assigned to the variables `s`, `m`, and `ops`, respectively. The initial values of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the new variables that have been assigned the return values from the function call.
