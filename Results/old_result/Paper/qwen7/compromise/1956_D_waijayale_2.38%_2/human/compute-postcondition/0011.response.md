Postcondition: `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7; `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n; `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed; `s` is the sum of elements from index `l` to index `r` (inclusive); `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1]; `pos` is the index of the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1] plus `l`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`.
