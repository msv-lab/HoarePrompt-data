Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(l, r)` from the `ops` list. Therefore, the relevant objects are `l`, `r`, and `ops`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `ops` is the result of the function `func_2(a)`, where `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `l` and `r` are elements from the `ops` list.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `ops`.
   - Each element in `ops` is a tuple `(l, r)`, so the loop will continue until `ops` is empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `ops` is the only collection being iterated over, it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `l` and `r` will be determined by the tuples in `ops` during each iteration, but they don't need to be explicitly set before the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `ops` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`ops` must contain at least one element**.
