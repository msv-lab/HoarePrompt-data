Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7; `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n; `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed; `s` is the sum of elements from index `l` to index `r` (inclusive); `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1]; `pos` is the index of the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1] plus `l`; the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)`. This function call does not immediately change the values of the variables `a`, `l`, `r`, `ops`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos`. Instead, it initiates a recursive process. The values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state, but now there is an additional function call that needs to be considered in the current state.
