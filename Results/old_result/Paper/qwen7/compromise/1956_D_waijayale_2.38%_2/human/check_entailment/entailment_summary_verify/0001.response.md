### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is correct. Let's review the functions and their logic to ensure the correctness.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly sets all elements from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`.
   - The base case ensures that if `l == r` and `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`.
   - The recursive call ensures that the entire subarray is updated correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations `len(ops)`, and the operations list `ops`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is designed to maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and calls itself recursively for the left and right parts of the subarray excluding the position of the maximum element.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, number of operations, and the operations list.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints each operation in the format `(l + 1, r + 1)`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The base case in `func_1` correctly handles the scenario where `l == r` and ensures that the element is set to zero if it is not already zero.

2. **Recursive Operation**:
   - The recursive call in `func_1` ensures that the entire subarray is updated correctly.

3. **Maximization Logic**:
   - In `recursive_maximize_sum`, the logic to check if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` and then setting all elements to `r - l + 1` is sound. This ensures that the subarray is filled with the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum.

4. **Finding Maximum Element**:
   - The logic to find the maximum element and then recursively call `recursive_maximize_sum` on the left and right parts is correct. This ensures that the entire array is processed to maximize the sum.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output formatting in `func_3` is correct, ensuring that the operations are printed in the required format.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array using the allowed operations. Each function performs its intended task without errors, and the overall approach is sound.
