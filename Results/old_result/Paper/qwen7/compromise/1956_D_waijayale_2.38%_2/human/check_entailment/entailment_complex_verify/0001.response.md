### Reasoning

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The base case correctly handles the scenario where `l == r` and ensures that the element is set to zero if it is not already zero.
   - The recursive call ensures that the entire subarray is updated correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
   - Returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations `len(ops)`, and the operations list `ops`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - Correctly checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)\).
   - If true, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to \(r - l + 1\).
   - If false, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively calls itself on the left and right parts of the subarray excluding the position of the maximum element.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Reads the input values `n` and `a`.
   - Calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, number of operations, and the operations list.
   - Prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - Prints each operation in the format `(l + 1, r + 1)`.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The base case correctly sets the element to zero if it is not already zero.
  - The recursive call ensures that the entire subarray is updated to the correct value.

- **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
  - The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` ensures that the subarray is filled with the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum.
  - If the condition is false, the function correctly identifies the maximum element and processes the subarray accordingly.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function.
  - Returns the correct sum, number of operations, and the operations list.

- **Function `func_3`**:
  - Reads the input and processes it correctly.
  - Prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program step-by-step and validating each function, it is clear that the program correctly maximizes the sum of the array by setting subarrays to the smallest possible values that maximize the sum. The logic in each function is sound and the overall approach is correct.
