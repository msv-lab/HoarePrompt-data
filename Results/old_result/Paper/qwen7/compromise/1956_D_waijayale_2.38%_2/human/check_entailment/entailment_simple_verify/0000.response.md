### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Initial Call**: `func_1(a, 0, n-1, ops)` is called from `func_2`.
- **Base Case**: If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0. If true, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`.
- **Recursive Case**: It calls itself recursively with `l + 1` and `r`. Then, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If true, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1`, appends `(l, r)` to `ops`, and calls itself again with `l + 1` and `r`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Initialization**: It initializes `n` as the length of `a` and `ops` as an empty list.
- **Recursive Call**: Calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n-1)`.
- **Return**: Returns the sum of `a`, the length of `ops`, and `ops` itself.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum` Analysis:
- **Base Case**: If the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1`.
- **Recursive Case**: Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position. It then recursively calls itself for the left and right subarrays if the position is not at the boundaries.

#### Function `func_3` Analysis:
- **Input Reading**: Reads `n` and the array `a`.
- **Call to `func_2`**: Calls `func_2(a)` and gets the sum, number of operations, and operations themselves.
- **Output**: Prints the sum and number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Base Case Handling**: The base case in `func_1` handles the scenario where `l == r` correctly.
2. **Recursive Case Handling**: The recursive case in `func_1` updates the entire subarray to the MEX value, which is correct.
3. **Recursive Sum Maximization**: The `recursive_maximize_sum` function correctly identifies when to set the subarray to the MEX value and when to recurse further.
4. **Overall Logic**: The overall logic in `func_2` and `func_3` correctly follows the problem statement and the provided annotations.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting subarrays to their MEX values. The annotations and the problem description align with the implemented logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the given annotations.
