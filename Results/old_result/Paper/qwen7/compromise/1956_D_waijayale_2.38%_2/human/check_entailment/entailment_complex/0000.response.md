Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function ensures that all elements in the specified range `[l, r]` are either zero or equal to `r - l + 1`. It recursively processes the range, setting the appropriate values and recording the operations in the `ops` list.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function computes the maximum sum of the array `a` and the corresponding operations. It calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array and then returns the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function recursively processes sublists of `a` to maximize their sums. It checks if the current sum is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\). If so, it sets all elements in the sublist to \(r - l + 1\). Otherwise, it finds the maximum element and recursively processes the left and right parts of the sublist.
4. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and then prints the results along with the operations.

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, the logic appears sound:
- The `recursive_maximize_sum` function correctly identifies sublists where setting all elements to \(r - l + 1\) maximizes the sum.
- The `func_1` function ensures that the operations are applied correctly.
- The `func_2` function combines these operations to achieve the desired sum.
- The `func_3` function reads input, processes it, and outputs the correct results.

Since all functions work together to achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array with the allowed operations, and the provided examples demonstrate the expected behavior, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
