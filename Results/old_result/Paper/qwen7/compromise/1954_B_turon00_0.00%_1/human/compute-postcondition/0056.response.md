Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `ans` and `cnt` depend on the condition inside the loop, but these are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be directly adjusted here.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
