Postcondition: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` equals `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `t` is `t - 1` which is greater than 0, and `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`. If the set `aa` contains exactly one element, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.**
