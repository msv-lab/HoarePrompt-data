Output State: **`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` assigns the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. The initial state of `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` has already been incremented by 1. The condition `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `n`. Therefore, the updated state includes the assignment to `ans`, the fact that `i` is now `i + 1`, and the condition on `n` is preserved.
