Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, with `i` being `i + 1` and `n` being greater than `i + 1`.
