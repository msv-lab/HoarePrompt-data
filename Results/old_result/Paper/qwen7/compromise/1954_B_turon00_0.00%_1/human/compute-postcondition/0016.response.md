Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has a specific value such that `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `i`, `n`, and `tmp` were unaffected by this line of code, their states remain the same as the initial state.
