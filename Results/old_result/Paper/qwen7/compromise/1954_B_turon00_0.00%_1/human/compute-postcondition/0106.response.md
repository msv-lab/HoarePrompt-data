Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5) and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function checks if the array `a` is beautiful and returns a result based on this check.**

Note: The actual processing logic for determining if the array is beautiful and the specific return value are not detailed here as per the instruction to focus only on the parameters and return value.
