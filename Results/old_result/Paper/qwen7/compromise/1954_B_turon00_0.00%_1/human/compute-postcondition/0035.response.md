Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Given that `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be updated to 0 if its current value is greater than 0, or remain unchanged if its current value is less than or equal to 0. The values of `i` and `n` are such that `i` is equal to `n` after the loop, and `cnt` remains 0.
