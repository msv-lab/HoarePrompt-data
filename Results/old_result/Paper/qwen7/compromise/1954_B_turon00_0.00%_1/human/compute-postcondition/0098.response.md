Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has some value, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is equal to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The values of `i`, `n`, `tmp`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
