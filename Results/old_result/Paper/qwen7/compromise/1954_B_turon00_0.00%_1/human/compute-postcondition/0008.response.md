Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- `aa` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`, and currently contains only one unique element.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print(-1)
```

Since the print statement is directly printing `-1` without referencing any of the variables described in the initial state, the output will be:

Output: **-1**
