Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `tmp` has some value
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is reset to 0 and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again because the condition `i < n` will be false.
   - Therefore, there is no need to change `i` or `n` for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we cannot adjust them.
   - The other variables (`tmp`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition alone.

Given this analysis, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has some value, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is reset to 0 and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`**
