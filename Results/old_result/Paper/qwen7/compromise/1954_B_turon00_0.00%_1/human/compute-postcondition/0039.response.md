Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is `t-1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in `a`. The variables `ans`, `cnt`, `i`, and `t` are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
