Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` equals `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `t` is `t - 1` which is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
