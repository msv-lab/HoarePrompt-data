Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has some value, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is increased by 1, `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
