Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (`ans`) and the value of `cnt`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `cnt`, `ans` will take the minimum value between itself (which is not specified) and `cnt`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
