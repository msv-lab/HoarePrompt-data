Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is less than `n`, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `cnt`. The conditions involving `i`, `n`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
