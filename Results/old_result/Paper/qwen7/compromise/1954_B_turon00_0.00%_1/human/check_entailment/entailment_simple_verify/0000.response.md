### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Identify the Logic**: The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
2. **Check the Logic Implementation**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - It uses a set `aa` to check if all elements are the same.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that match `tmp`.
   - When a different element is found, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive matching elements seen so far.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initial Check for All Elements Being Same**:
   ```python
   if len(aa) == 1:
       print(-1)
   ```
   This part correctly identifies if the array is already beautiful (all elements are the same). In such a case, it prints `-1`, which is correct.

2. **Counting Consecutive Matching Elements**:
   ```python
   cnt = 0
   ans = n
   for i in range(n):
       if a[i] == tmp:
           cnt += 1
       else:
           ans = min(ans, cnt)
           cnt = 0
   ans = min(ans, cnt)
   ```
   - `cnt` counts consecutive matching elements.
   - `ans` keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive matching elements seen so far.
   - When a different element is found, `cnt` is reset to 0, and `ans` is updated with the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.

3. **Final Output**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```
   The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Test Cases Verification:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   ```
   Input:
   5
   1 2 1 2 1
   ```
   - The array is not all the same, so it should not print `-1`.
   - The program correctly identifies that removing one element (at index 2) makes the array non-beautiful.
   - Expected Output: `1`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   ```
   Input:
   3
   2 2 2
   ```
   - The array is all the same, so it prints `-1`.
   - Expected Output: `-1`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   ```
   Input:
   7
   3 3 3 5 3 3 3
   ```
   - The array is not all the same, so it should not print `-1`.
   - The program correctly identifies that removing three elements (at indices 3, 4, and 6) makes the array non-beautiful.
   - Expected Output: `3`

4. **Additional Test Cases**:
   - For arrays like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, and others, the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The original assessment incorrectly identified the program as incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the logic. The program handles all edge cases and general cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
