### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a set (`aa`). If they are, it prints `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to track unique elements.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of the same element (`cnt`).
   - It updates the answer (`ans`) with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is already uniform (all elements the same) is correct.
   - The counting of consecutive occurrences and updating the answer seems to follow the requirement of making the array non-beautiful.
   - The solution correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, the solution correctly outputs `-1`.
   - The solution correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

However, there are some issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Logic for Counting Consecutive Occurrences**: The current implementation uses a set `aa` to track unique elements, which is unnecessary and does not help in counting consecutive occurrences. Instead, it should directly count consecutive occurrences of the same element.
- **Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**: The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It only counts consecutive occurrences but does not ensure that the array becomes non-beautiful after removing those elements.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest subarray where the beauty condition holds and then calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break this condition.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Find the longest subarray where the beauty condition holds
        max_beauty_length = 0
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i - 1] == a[i + 1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_beauty_length = max(max_beauty_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove
        if max_beauty_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_beauty_length)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the given solution does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The provided solution incorrectly uses a set to track unique elements and does not properly handle the logic for finding the minimum removals.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
