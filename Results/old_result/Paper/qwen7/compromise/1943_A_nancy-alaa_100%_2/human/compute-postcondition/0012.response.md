Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- `n` is an input integer (though its value is not specified).
- `first` is a boolean variable and is explicitly given as `True`.
- `mpp[i]` is explicitly given as 1, since `i` is 0 and `mpp[0]` is set to 1.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
