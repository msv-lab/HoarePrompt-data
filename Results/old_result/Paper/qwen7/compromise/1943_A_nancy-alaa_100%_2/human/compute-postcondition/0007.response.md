Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `n` is an input integer but its specific value is not given.
- `mpp` is a dictionary, and the current value of `i` (which is 0) is not in the keys of `mpp`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly given as 0, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
