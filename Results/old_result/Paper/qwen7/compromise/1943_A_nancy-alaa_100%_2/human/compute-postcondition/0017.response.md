Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mpp[i]` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `first` was originally set to `True`. After executing `first = True`, the value of `first` remains `True` because the line of code does not change its value. However, since the question asks for the output state after running the code, and the only change is that `first` is no longer `True`, we update `first` to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `mpp[i]`) remain unchanged.
