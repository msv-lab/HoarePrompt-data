Output State: **`first` is `False`, `i` is `n` + 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will increment to `n + 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n` inclusive. The variable `first` remains `False` because it is only set to `True` when `i` is `n` and `mpp[i]` is `1`, which happens only once per test case. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
