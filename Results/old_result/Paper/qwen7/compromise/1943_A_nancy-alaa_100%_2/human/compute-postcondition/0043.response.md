Output State: `first` is False, `i` is 3, and `n` is an input integer. Since the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n`, and it has executed 3 times, `i` will be 3 after all iterations. The value of `first` remains False because none of the conditions inside the loop that could change its value were met during the iterations. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
