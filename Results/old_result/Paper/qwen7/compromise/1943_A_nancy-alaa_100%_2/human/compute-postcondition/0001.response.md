Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input is taken for `n`. Therefore, `t` stays as a positive integer within the specified range, and `n` is assigned the integer value entered by the user.
