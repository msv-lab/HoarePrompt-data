Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 3.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n` inclusive, i.e., `i` will take values from 0 to `n`.

4. **Check the initial value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 3, the loop will not execute because the loop will start with `i = 0` and go up to `n`. For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 0.

5. **Adjust the state of `i`**: To ensure the loop starts correctly, `i` must be adjusted to start from 0.

6. **Consider the value of `n`**: The value of `n` must be such that the loop can run. Since `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `n`, `n` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
