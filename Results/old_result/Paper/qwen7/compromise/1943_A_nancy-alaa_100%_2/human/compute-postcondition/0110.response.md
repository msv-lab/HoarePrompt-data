Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` equals 1, and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
