Output State: **`i` is equal to `n` + 2, `first` retains its original value, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `first`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
