Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `first` remains `False`.
   - `i` is `1`.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop is that if `i` (which is 1) is not in the keys of `mpp`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1, then `first` becomes `True`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n + 1):`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n`.

3. **Current State of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `n`.

5. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is currently `1`, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

6. **States to Adjust:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it will be incremented to `2` in the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`first` and `mpp`) are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the conditions inside the loop body.

7. **Updated States:**
   - `first` remains `False` unless the loop body sets it to `True`.
   - `i` changes to `2`.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop remains the same: if `i` (which is now `2`) is not in the keys of `mpp`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[2]` equals 1, then `first` becomes `True`.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: **`first` remains `False`, `i` is `2`, and if `i` (which is 2) is not in the keys of `mpp`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[2]` equals 1, then `first` becomes `True`.**
