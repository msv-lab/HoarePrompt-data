### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array \(a\) of size \(n\). Alice picks elements from \(a\) and appends them to her own array \(c\), while Bob only removes elements from \(a\). The goal is to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array \(c\) at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX of \(c\).
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX of \(c\).

3. **Key Insight**:
   - If there are enough unique numbers in \(a\) that can be picked by Alice, she can ensure that the MEX of \(c\) is high.
   - Conversely, Bob can strategically pick numbers to reduce the MEX.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array \(a\).
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to \(n+1\) to find the smallest number that is not present in the `Counter` or has been picked by Alice (i.e., `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`).

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code checks for the smallest number that is not in the `Counter` or has been picked by Alice.
   - This approach correctly identifies the MEX of the array \(c\) under the assumption that both players play optimally.
   - The code handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles cases where there are no gaps in the sequence (e.g., `[0, 1, 2, 3]` results in MEX = 1).
   - It also handles cases where Alice can fill gaps (e.g., `[0, 0, 1, 1]` results in MEX = 2).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array \(c\) under the optimal play of both players. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
