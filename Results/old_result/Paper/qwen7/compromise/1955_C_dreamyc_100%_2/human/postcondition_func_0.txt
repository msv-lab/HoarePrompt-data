The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5; `k`, a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It returns either the value of `n` or the count of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, where `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, and `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`.
