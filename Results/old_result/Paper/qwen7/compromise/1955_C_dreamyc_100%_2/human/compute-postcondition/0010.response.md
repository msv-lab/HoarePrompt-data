Output State: **The program returns the count of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, where `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, and `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`.**
