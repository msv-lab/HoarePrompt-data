You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, k is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the value of n, which is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5.
    #State: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, k is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The sum of nums is greater than k.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`, `ans` is the count of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `nums`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the count of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, where `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, and `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5; `k`, a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It returns either the value of `n` or the count of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, where `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, and `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of n, which is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5.

Case_2: The program returns the count of indices `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, where `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, and `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
