Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the ships based on the given rules. However, there are a few issues with the logic used in the `func_1` function that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Durability Reduction**: The function calculates the number of ships that would sink if the Kraken attacks based on the sum of the first and last parts of the list, which doesn't accurately reflect the actual sinking process. The program needs to simulate the attacks iteratively, reducing the durability of the ships and checking when they sink.

2. **Logic for Sinking Ships**: The current logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the sinking process. It simply checks if the sum of the first `i+1` elements or the last `i+1` elements is less than or equal to `a` or `b`, respectively, without actually reducing the durability of the ships and checking their status after each attack.

3. **Handling of Attacks**: The function should keep track of which ships are still in the game (not sunk) and alternate between attacking the first and last ships until all ships are sunk or the attacks are exhausted.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly simulate the described scenario. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
