Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.
- The provided code has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` takes an array, sorts it, and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of adjacent elements. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty because sorting the array does not consider the optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty.
- `func_2` reads input data, processes multiple test cases using `func_1`, and prints the results. However, `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem since sorting the array does not maximize the beauty as required.
- To correctly solve the problem, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. One effective strategy is to sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, but ensuring that the largest elements are placed at the ends of the sorted array to maximize the positive differences.

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal arrangement of elements to maximize the beauty.

Correctness: **False**
