Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of adjacent elements.
   - The logic here is to maximize the beauty, which is the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. Sorting the array ensures that the differences between adjacent elements are minimized, leading to the maximum possible sum of these differences.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes it to extract the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, extracts the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` to compute the beauty of the array and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes it to extract the necessary information for each test case.
   - The state transitions and operations within `func_2` are consistent with the problem description.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The output of `func_2` is correct as it prints the results for each test case as required.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the sum of absolute differences between adjacent elements.

Correctness: **True**
