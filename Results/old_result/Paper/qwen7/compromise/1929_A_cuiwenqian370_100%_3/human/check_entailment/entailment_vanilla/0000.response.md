### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this, we need to arrange the elements such that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized while minimizing the negative differences.

2. **Key Insight**: The beauty of the array can be maximized by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. This ensures that the smallest element is paired with the next smallest element, and so on, thereby maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function sorts the array.
   - It calculates the beauty as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach is correct because sorting ensures that the differences are maximized.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute the beauty for each test case.
   - The logic for reading and processing input is correct.
   - The use of `func_1` within `func_2` is correct and consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions work correctly according to the problem statement.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.
   - The output format matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
