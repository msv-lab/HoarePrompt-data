Output State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `S` is a list containing `n+1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist contains two integers where the first integer is the count of '0's encountered up to that point in the string `a`, and the second integer is the count of '1's encountered up to that point.
