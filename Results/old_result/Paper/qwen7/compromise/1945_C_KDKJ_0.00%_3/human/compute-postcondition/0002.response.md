Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any input parameters but generates and returns a string. The length of this string, `n`, is an integer within the range of 3 to 300,000 (inclusive), and each character in the string is either '0' or '1'.
