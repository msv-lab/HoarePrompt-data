Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices in the tree), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges in the tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, then performs a binary search to find the maximum number of connected components that can be achieved by removing up to `k` edges. The function prints the result, which is the last value of `r` before `l` becomes greater than `r`.**
