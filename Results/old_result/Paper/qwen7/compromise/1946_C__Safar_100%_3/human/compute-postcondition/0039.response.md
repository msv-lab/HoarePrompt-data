The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(a, b)` represents an edge connecting vertices `a` and `b`.

After executing the function body, the function either removes `k` edges from the tree represented by the given edges or returns an appropriate message if `k` is greater than the number of edges in the tree. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of tuples `edges`, and remove `k` edges from the tree represented by the edges list if possible, otherwise return an error message indicating that the number of edges to remove exceeds the total number of edges in the tree.
