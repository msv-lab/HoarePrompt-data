### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function summary step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- For each winning outcome \( i \), the amount received back is \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \).

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads \( N \) (number of outcomes) and a list of multipliers `vals`.
   - Calculates the product of all multipliers: `prod = 1` and iterates through `vals` to compute `prod`.
   - Computes `vprod` as `[prod // r for r in vals]`, which means each element in `vprod` is the product of all multipliers divided by the corresponding multiplier.
   - Checks if the difference between `prod` and the sum of `vprod` (`den = prod - sum(vprod)`) is less than or equal to 0.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and exits.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

2. **Function Summary Recap**:
   - The function reads \( N \) and a list of \( N \) positive integers.
   - It calculates the product of all elements in the list.
   - It computes a new list where each element is the product of all elements divided by the corresponding element.
   - If the difference between the product and the sum of the new list is non-positive, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of the new list.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
```
3
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

- The program calculates `prod` as \(5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 3125\).
- It then computes `vprod` as \([625, 625, 625, 625, 625]\).
- The sum of `vprod` is \(625 \times 5 = 3125\).
- `den = 3125 - 3125 = 0`, which is less than or equal to 0.
- Therefore, the program prints `-1`.

However, a valid distribution does exist: betting 1 coin on each outcome results in a total bet of 5 coins, which is less than the 25 coins received back for each winning outcome.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The program's logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- The function summary indicates that the program attempts to distribute the coins based on the product of all multipliers divided by each individual multiplier, which does not necessarily result in a valid distribution.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
