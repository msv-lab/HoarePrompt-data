Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to distribute the coins based on the product of all multipliers divided by each individual multiplier, but this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

The program calculates `prod` as \(5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 3125\) and then calculates `vprod` as \([625, 625, 625, 625, 625]\). It then calculates `den` as \(3125 - 5 \times 625 = 0\), which is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists. However, a valid distribution does exist: betting 1 coin on each outcome results in a total bet of 5 coins, which is less than the 25 coins received back for each winning outcome.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.
