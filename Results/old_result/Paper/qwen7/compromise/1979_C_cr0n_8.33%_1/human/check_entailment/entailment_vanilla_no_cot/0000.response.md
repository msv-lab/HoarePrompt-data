Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides it by each multiplier to get `vprod`. This approach doesn't ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. Instead, it calculates a distribution that might not meet the requirement.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Constraints**: The program does not properly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

3. **Incorrect Output for Cases with No Solution**: For cases where no valid distribution exists (e.g., when all multipliers are the same), the program incorrectly prints a solution instead of `-1`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. One way to achieve this is by setting each bet to a value that ensures this condition holds true. A simple and effective strategy is to set each bet to a constant value (e.g., 1) and check if the condition is met.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
cases = int(input())
for n in range(cases):
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    
    # Check if a solution exists
    if min(vals) == max(vals):
        print(-1)
    else:
        # Set each bet to 1 and calculate the total bet
        total_bet = sum(1 for _ in vals)
        
        # Check if the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome
        if all(total_bet * val < val * (val - 1) for val in vals):
            print(' '.join(str(1) for _ in vals))
        else:
            print(-1)
```

This corrected program checks if a solution exists and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.
