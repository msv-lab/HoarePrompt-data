#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and k is a list of n positive integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: prod is the product of all elements in vals, t remains unchanged, N remains unchanged.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.
    #State: `vprod` is a list where each element is the value of `prod` divided by each corresponding element in `vals`, `t` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [vprod[0], vprod[1], ..., vprod[N-1]] (where vprod[i] = prod / vals[i] for i in range(N) and den = prod - sum(vprod))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `N` and a list of `N` positive integers `vals`. It calculates the product of all elements in `vals` and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. If the difference between the product and the sum of `vprod` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and exits. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value.
