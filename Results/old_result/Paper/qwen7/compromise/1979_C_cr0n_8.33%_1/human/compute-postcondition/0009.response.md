Output: **-1**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `vprod` is a list where each element is the value of `prod` divided by each corresponding element in `vals`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
- The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

The `print(-1)` statement simply prints the integer `-1`. Since no other variables or values are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `vprod`, `prod`, `vals`, `t`, `N`, or `den`.

Therefore, the output is **-1**.
