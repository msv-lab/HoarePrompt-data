Output State: **`prod` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `prod` to 1. The values of `t`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `prod` is set to 1, while `t`, `N`, and `vals` retain their original values and conditions.
