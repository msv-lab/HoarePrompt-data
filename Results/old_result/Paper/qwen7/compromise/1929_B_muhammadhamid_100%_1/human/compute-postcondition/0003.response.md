Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives three parameters (t, n, k) where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function returns a value based on the conditions provided for n and k.**

However, since the function definition itself does not specify what it returns based on the given constraints, the exact return value cannot be detailed without additional information.
