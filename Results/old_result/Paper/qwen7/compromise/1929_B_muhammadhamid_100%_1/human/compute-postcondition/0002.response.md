Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the conditions given within the loop. For each test case, if \( k = 1 \), it will print 1. If \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), it will print \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). Otherwise, it will print \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

This output state will be determined by the values of \( n \) and \( k \) entered for each test case during the loop's execution.
