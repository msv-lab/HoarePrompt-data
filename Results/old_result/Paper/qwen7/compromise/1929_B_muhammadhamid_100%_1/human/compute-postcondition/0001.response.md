Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the conditions given within the loop. For each test case, if \(k = 1\), the output will be `1`. If \(k \leq 2(n + (n - 2))\), the output will be \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\). Otherwise, the output will be \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\).

This means the output will be a list of numbers corresponding to each test case's result after applying the given conditions.
