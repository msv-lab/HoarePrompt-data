Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`, the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. The condition for `n` and `rightOne` remains the same.
