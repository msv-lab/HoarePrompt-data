Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is increased by 1**.

The code increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `mid + 1` and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`. The value of `rightZero` is updated to reflect this increment.
