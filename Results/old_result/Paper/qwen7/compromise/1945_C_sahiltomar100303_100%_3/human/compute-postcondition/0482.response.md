Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `left` remains 0, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0, and `left` is not equal to 0. If `right` equals `n`, then either `left` remains non-zero, or `tleftZero` is adjusted such that if it is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is less than or equal to `n // 2` while keeping other conditions intact. Additionally, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` if the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.
