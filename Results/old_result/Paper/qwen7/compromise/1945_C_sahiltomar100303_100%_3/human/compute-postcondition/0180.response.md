Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is either 1 or 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is either 0 or 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `mid` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is either 0 or 1, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was either 0 or 1 before this operation, it will now be 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1). However, since the initial state specifies that `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, the updated value remains within these bounds. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
