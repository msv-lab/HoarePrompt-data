Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` remains unchanged, and `rightOne` is `trightOne + 1`. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. All other conditions and relationships remain the same as per the initial state. Specifically, `left` is now `mid - 1` instead of `mid`, and the conditions involving `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and their respective comparisons still hold true as described.
