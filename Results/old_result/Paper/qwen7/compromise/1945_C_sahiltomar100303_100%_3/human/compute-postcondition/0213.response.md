Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop starts from `mid` and goes up to `n-1` (since `range(mid, n)` includes `mid` but not `n`).

3. **Understand the Postconditions**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is `mid + 1`.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently `mid + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `mid + 2`.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `total` remains unchanged.
   - `i` will be incremented to `mid + 2`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, and `i` must be less than `n`**.
