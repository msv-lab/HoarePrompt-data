Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `left` remains 0, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, if `left == 0`, the following conditions hold:
- If `right != n`, the postcondition holds.
- If `right == n`, then either `tleftZero` remains unchanged if it is already greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, or `tleftZero` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `n // 2` while maintaining other conditions.
- If `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the postcondition holds regardless of the value of `tleftZero`.
- If `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the postcondition also holds.

If `left` is not equal to 0, the following conditions hold:
- `tleftZero` is adjusted such that if it is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is less than or equal to `n // 2` while keeping other conditions intact.
- The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.
