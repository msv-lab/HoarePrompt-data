Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero`, `rightOne` is `trightOne + 2`, `s[left - 1] != '0'`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`; either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Initially, `rightOne` was `trightOne + rightOne`. After incrementing, it becomes `trightOne + rightOne + 1`, which simplifies to `trightOne + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state must still hold true.
