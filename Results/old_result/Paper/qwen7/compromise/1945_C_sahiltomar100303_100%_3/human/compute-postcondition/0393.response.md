Postcondition: `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` remains unchanged, and `rightOne` is `trightOne + 1`. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is increased by 2.
