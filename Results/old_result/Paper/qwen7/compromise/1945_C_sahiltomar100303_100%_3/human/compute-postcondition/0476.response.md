Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `left` remains 0.
- `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
- `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
- `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0.
- The current value of `left` is not equal to 0.
- The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.

Given these conditions, the only variable that the `print` statement refers to is `left`. From the conditions, it is explicitly stated that the current value of `left` is not equal to 0. Therefore, `left` must be a non-zero value.

Output: **0**
