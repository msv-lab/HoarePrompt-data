Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-4`, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `total` remains 0, `i` is updated to `n-4` (since `i` was initially `n-3`), and the constraints on `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged.
