Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` adjusted by the if-else condition (either incremented by 1 or unchanged), `rightOne` is either `rightOne + 1` or remains unchanged, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, otherwise `leftZero` remains unchanged, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` if `s[left - 1] != '0'`, otherwise `leftOne` remains unchanged.
