Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` is adjusted based on the value of `s[left - 1]`: if `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `leftZero` remains unchanged and `rightOne` is increased by 1 while `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightZero` is increased by 1.
