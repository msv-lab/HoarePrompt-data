Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` (if `s[left - 1] != '0'`), and `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`**

Explanation: The line `leftZero -= 1` decreases the value of `leftZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions and relationships between the variables that were true before the operation still hold.
