Output State: **`left` is `mid - 2`, `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero - 1`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`, and `rightOne` must satisfy the condition `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other variables (`left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
