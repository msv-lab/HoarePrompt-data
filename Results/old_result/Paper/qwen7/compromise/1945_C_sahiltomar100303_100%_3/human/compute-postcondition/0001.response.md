Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute if `t` is at least 1.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0, and given the constraints on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
