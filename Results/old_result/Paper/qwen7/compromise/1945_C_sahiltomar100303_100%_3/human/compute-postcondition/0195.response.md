Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(mid, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`, `mid`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is set to `mid` at the beginning of the loop.
   - `mid` is given as `n // 2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts with `i = mid` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n`.
   - The loop body is omitted, so we don't know the exact operations inside the loop, but we know that `i` will increment from `mid` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = mid`, `i` should be adjusted to `mid`.
   - `n` remains unchanged during the loop execution.
   - `mid` remains unchanged during the loop execution.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`. The state of `mid` does not need to be adjusted because it is a constant value derived from `n` and does not change during the loop execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
**`total` is 0, `i` is `mid`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`**
