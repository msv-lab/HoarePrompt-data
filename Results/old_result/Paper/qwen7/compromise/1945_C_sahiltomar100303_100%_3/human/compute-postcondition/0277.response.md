Postcondition: `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 3, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if `s[right-1]` is '0', otherwise it is decreased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is always decreased by 1; `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right-1]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.
