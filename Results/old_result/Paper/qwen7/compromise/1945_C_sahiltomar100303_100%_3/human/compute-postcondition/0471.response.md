Postcondition: **`right` is equal to `n`, `left` remains 0, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0. If `left` is not 0, `left` remains non-zero. If `left` is 0, `tleftZero` is adjusted such that if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2` while keeping other conditions intact.**
