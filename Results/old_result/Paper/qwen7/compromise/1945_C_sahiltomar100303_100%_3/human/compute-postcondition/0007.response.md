Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `leftOne` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, or `rightZero`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `leftOne` is updated to 0.
