Postcondition: **Output State: The loop continues to increment `right` until the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` no longer holds true. At this point, the loop terminates. By the end of all iterations, `right` will be the maximum index such that the condition still holds, `tleftZero` will be the total count of '0's from index `0` to `right-1`, `trightZero` will be the count of '0's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `trightOne` will be the count of '1's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `tleftOne` will be the total count of '1's from index `0` to `right-1`, `left` will be the last index where the condition was met, `leftMove` will be the number of times `left` was incremented, and `s` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `left` is currently equal to 0, and the condition `(right != n)` is true.**
