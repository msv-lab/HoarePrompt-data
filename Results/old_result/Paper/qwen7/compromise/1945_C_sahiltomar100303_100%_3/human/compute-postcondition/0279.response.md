Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is the original index plus 1, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if `s[right-2]` is '0', otherwise it is decreased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-2]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is decreased by 1; `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right-2]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. This means that wherever `right` was pointing before, it now points to the next index in the string `s`. The conditions for updating `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` now refer to the character at the new position `right-1`, which was previously at `right-2`. Therefore, the updated conditions are based on the character at `s[right-2]`.
