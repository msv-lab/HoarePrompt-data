Output State: **`left` is either `mid - 4` or `mid - 5`, `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 2` or `trightZero + rightZero - 1` or `trightZero + rightZero - 1` or `trightZero + rightZero`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or `rightZero`, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` or `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, with `rightOne` increased by 1 if `s[left - 1] != '0'`, and `left` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decreases the value of `left` by 1. The possible values of `left` before the operation were `mid - 3` or `mid - 4`. After decrementing, these become `mid - 4` or `mid - 5`, respectively. The values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation.
