Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` (it either increases by 1 or stays the same), `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` (it either stays the same or increases by 1), `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` (if `s[left - 1] == '0'`), and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` (if `s[left - 1] != '0'`).**

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `left` is now `mid - 1`. The conditions and values of `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftMove`, `leftZero`, and `leftOne` remain as described in the initial state.
