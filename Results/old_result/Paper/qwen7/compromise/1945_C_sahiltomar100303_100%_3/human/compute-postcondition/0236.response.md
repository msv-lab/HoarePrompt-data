Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-2`, `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2, and `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `i` was initially `n-1`, after decrementing `leftZero` by 1, `i` becomes `n-2`. The conditions for `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and `total` remain unchanged.
