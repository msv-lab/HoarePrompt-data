Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-3`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, and if `s[left - 2] == '0'`, then `rightZero` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `left` was `n-2`. After decrementing, `left` becomes `n-3`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
