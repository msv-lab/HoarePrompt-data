Postcondition: `right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 3) // 2`, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`. If `s[right]` equals '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `trightOne` is decreased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.
