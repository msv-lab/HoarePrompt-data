Output State: `right` is equal to `n`, `left` remains 0, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `right` will be incremented until it reaches `n`. At this point, the condition `right < n` in the while loop will no longer be satisfied, causing the loop to terminate. Throughout the loop's execution, `left` remains unchanged at 0. The conditions on `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` ensure that these counts are adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s`, with the constraints provided by the loop's termination condition.
