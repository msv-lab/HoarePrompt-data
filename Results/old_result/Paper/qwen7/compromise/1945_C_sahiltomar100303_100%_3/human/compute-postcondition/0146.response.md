Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0' and 2 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is equal to `n`, and neither `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` nor `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` holds true.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. It retains the conditions specified in the preconditions and postconditions of each part, ensuring that the overall postcondition accurately reflects the possible outcomes of the if-else statement.
