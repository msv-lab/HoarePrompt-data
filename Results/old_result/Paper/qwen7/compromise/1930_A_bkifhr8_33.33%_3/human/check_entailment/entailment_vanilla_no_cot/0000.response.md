Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of List Length**: The logic inside the nested loop where `lst` is being manipulated is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not appropriate because the list length should be checked at the beginning of each iteration, and the removal of elements should be done correctly.

2. **List Indexing Error**: The indices used for removing elements from the list are incorrect. The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect and should be simplified to just `lst.remove(lst[0])` and `lst.remove(lst[1])`.

3. **Incomplete Removal of Elements**: The program does not handle the case where the list length is not always even after each removal, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Efficient Pairing Logic Missing**: The program does not ensure that the optimal pairs are chosen, which is necessary to maximize the score.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        score = 0
        for i in range(n):
            # Always take the minimum of the current pair
            score += nums[i]
        ans_f.append(score)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the list of numbers and then iteratively adds the smallest available number to the score, ensuring that the maximum possible score is achieved.
