Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. The logic inside the loop where the score is calculated is flawed. It incorrectly removes elements from the list `lst` in a way that does not ensure the optimal pairing of the smallest elements.
4. The program should sort the list of integers before processing them to ensure that the smallest elements are paired together, which maximizes the score.
5. The current implementation does not handle the sorting step, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score because it does not ensure that the smallest elements are paired together. To achieve the maximum score, the list of integers should be sorted in ascending order, and then pairs of consecutive elements should be chosen to maximize the sum of their minimums. The current implementation fails to do this, leading to incorrect results.
