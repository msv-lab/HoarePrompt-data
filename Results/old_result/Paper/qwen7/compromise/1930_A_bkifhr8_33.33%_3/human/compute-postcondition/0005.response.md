Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `l` is the string input by the user.**

The code `l = input()` assigns the string input by the user to the variable `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
