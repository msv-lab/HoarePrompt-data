Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000, ans_f is a list containing the cumulative sums of ans for each iteration, lst is an empty list, i is the last element of ans_f.**

In the final state after all iterations of the loop have executed, `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set. `ans_f` will be a list containing the cumulative sums of `ans` for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop processes each element of `ans_f`, `lst` remains an empty list. The variable `i` will hold the value of the last element of `ans_f` after all iterations have completed.
