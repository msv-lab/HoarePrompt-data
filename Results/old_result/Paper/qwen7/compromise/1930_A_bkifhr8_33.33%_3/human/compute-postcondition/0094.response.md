Output State: **`i` is the current value of `i` + 1, `t` remains the same, `ans` is `ans` plus the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst`, and `lst` does not contain the element at index 1.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index 0 * 2, which is index 0 since 0 * 2 equals 0. After removing the element at index 0, the list no longer contains the element at index 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
