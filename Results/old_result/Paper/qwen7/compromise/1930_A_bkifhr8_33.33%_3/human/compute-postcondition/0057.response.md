Postcondition: `i` is less than `n * 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, the second element of `lst` is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, either the second element is removed or the list is modified to remove the element at index 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
