Output State: **`i` is (n * 2) + 1, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is 0, `lst` is empty or contains fewer elements than it did initially, `l` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code `l = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `l`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `t`, `ans`, and `lst`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
