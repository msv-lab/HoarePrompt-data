Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `ans` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `ans`, and `ans_f`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0 is still valid.
