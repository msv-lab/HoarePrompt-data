Output State: **`i` is within the range 0 to n * 2, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, and now `lst` does not contain the element at index 2 (which was previously lst[1 * 2]), and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `1 * 2` (which is index 2) from the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `lst` does not contain the element at index 0 * 2 (index 0) is still valid. The length of `lst` is not specified to be 2 after the removal, so it remains as "not equal to 2".
