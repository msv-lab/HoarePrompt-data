Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` will be equal to `n * 2`.
   - `ans_f` contains the latest value of `ans`.
   - `lst` is empty or contains fewer elements than it did initially.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration (as per the `range(t)`), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` or `(n * 2) + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes `(n * 2) + 1`.
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ans_f` and `lst` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is (n * 2) + 1, `t` is the same as before, `ans_f` contains the latest value of `ans`, and `lst` is empty or contains fewer elements than it did initially**.
