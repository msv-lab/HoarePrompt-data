Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is `min(int(lst[1]), int(lst[1]))`, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, the length of `lst` is 0**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `1 * 2` (which is index 2) from the list `lst`. Since the initial length of `lst` is 1, removing the only element in the list makes its length 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
