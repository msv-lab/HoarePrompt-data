Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the second element of `lst` is removed.**

Explanation: The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` updates `ans` by adding the minimum value between the first and second elements of `lst` (converted to integers). After this operation, the second element of `lst` is removed, as per the precondition. The value of `i` remains unchanged since no operation affects it directly, and it was initially stated that `i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`.
