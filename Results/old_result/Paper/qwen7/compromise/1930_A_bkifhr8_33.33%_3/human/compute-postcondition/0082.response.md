Postcondition: `i` is within the range 0 to n * 2, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` does not contain the element at index 2 (which was previously `lst[1 * 2]`). If the length of `lst` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
