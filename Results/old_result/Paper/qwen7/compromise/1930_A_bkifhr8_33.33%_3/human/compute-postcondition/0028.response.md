Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans` is twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `ans_f` is an empty list, and the second element of `lst` is removed.**

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `2` (since `1 * 2` equals `2`) from the list `lst`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `ans`, or `ans_f`. The only change is that the second element of `lst` is removed.
