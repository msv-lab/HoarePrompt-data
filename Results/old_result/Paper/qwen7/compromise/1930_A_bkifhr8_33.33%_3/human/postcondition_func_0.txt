The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (half the number of elements in the sequence), and a sequence of \( 2n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of every pair of consecutive integers in the sequence and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each calculated sum. The function does not return any value but modifies a list `ans_f` which contains the results for all test cases.
