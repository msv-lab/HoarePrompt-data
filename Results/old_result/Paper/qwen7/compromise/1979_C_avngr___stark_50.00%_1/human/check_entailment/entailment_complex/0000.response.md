Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. The solution provided uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the multipliers to achieve this.

2. **Key Steps in the Solution**:
   - Calculate the product of all multipliers (`m`).
   - Compute the individual bets as `m / k[i]` for each outcome.
   - Find the GCD of these individual bets using `func_1`.
   - Adjust the bets by dividing each by the GCD.
   - Check if the sum of the adjusted bets is less than or equal to the adjusted product (`m / hcf`). If true, print the bets; otherwise, print `-1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - It iterates through the list, updating the GCD with each element.

4. **Execution States**:
   - The program initializes variables correctly and processes each test case as required.
   - The GCD calculation is performed accurately.
   - The bets are adjusted correctly and checked against the condition.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where the sum of adjusted bets is not less than the adjusted product by printing `-1`.
   - The solution ensures that the bets are within the specified range (1 to \(10^9\)).

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
