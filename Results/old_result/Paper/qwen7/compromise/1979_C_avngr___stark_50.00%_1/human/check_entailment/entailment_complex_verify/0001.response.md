### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all multipliers.
   - This is done using the line `m = m * k[i]`, which iterates through all multipliers and multiplies them together.

3. **Calculating Individual Bets:**
   - The program then calculates individual bets `c[i]` for each outcome using the formula `c[i] = int(m / k[i])`.
   - This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is `sum(c)`.

4. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to find the GCD of the calculated bets `c`.
   - This function correctly uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the GCD.

5. **Adjusting Bets to Ensure Feasibility:**
   - The program divides each bet `c[i]` by the GCD found in the previous step.
   - This step ensures that the bets are simplified to their smallest form while maintaining the ratio.

6. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the adjusted bets is less than the product `m` divided by the GCD.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, it prints `-1` indicating no feasible solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the adjusted bets.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Mathematical Feasibility:**
   - The logic of calculating bets and checking feasibility is mathematically sound.
   - The use of GCD simplifies the bets to their smallest form, ensuring the sum of bets is minimized.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of bets is not less than the required value by printing `-1`.

3. **Functionality:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the bets in the required format, either `-1` or the sequence of bets.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
  - `k_i` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for each \(i\), and the sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

- **Product Calculation:**
  - `m` is the product of all multipliers \(k_i\). This is computed correctly.

- **Individual Bets Calculation:**
  - `c[i] = int(m / k[i])` ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is `sum(c)`. This is correct.

- **GCD Calculation:**
  - `func_1` correctly finds the GCD of the list `c` using the `gcd` function.

- **Adjusting Bets:**
  - Each bet `c[i]` is divided by the GCD, ensuring the bets are simplified to their smallest form.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The sum of the adjusted bets is checked against `m / hcf`. If the sum is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the adjusted bets are printed.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic to determine and print the bets in a way that ensures coming out ahead in the event of any winning outcome, as per the problem statement. The program handles all necessary calculations and checks correctly.
