### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all multipliers.
   - This is done using the line `m = m * k[i]`, which iterates through all multipliers and multiplies them together.

3. **Calculating Individual Bets:**
   - The program then calculates individual bets `c[i]` for each outcome using the formula `c[i] = int(m / k[i])`.
   - This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is `sum(c)`.

4. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to find the GCD of the calculated bets `c`.
   - This function correctly uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the GCD.

5. **Adjusting Bets to Ensure Feasibility:**
   - The program divides each bet `c[i]` by the GCD found in the previous step.
   - This step ensures that the bets are simplified to their smallest form while maintaining the ratio.

6. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the adjusted bets is less than the product `m` divided by the GCD.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, it prints `-1` indicating no feasible solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the adjusted bets.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Mathematical Feasibility:**
   - The logic of calculating bets and checking feasibility is mathematically sound.
   - The use of GCD simplifies the bets to their smallest form, ensuring the sum of bets is minimized.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of bets is not less than the required value by printing `-1`.

3. **Functionality:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the bets in the required format, either `-1` or the sequence of bets.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is read from input, representing the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n` and the list of multipliers `k` are read.

- **Product Calculation:**
  - The product `m` of all multipliers is calculated.
  - This ensures that `m` represents the total amount of coins that would be returned if any single outcome were to win.

- **Individual Bet Calculation:**
  - Each bet `c[i]` is calculated as `int(m / k[i])`.
  - This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is `sum(c)`.

- **GCD Calculation:**
  - The GCD of the bets `c` is computed using `func_1`.
  - This simplifies the bets to their smallest form while maintaining the ratio.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The sum of the adjusted bets is checked against `m / hcf`.
  - If the sum is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, the program prints `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it prints the adjusted bets.

### Conclusion

Given the detailed analysis and the annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic to determine and print the bets in a way that ensures coming out ahead in the event of any winning outcome, as per the problem statement. The program handles all edge cases and outputs the results in the required format.
