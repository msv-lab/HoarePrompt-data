Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `c` is the second integer input from the user.**

The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
