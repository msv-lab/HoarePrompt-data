Output State: **`k` is `j` + 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the second integer input from the user, `j` is 0, `c` is the third integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
