Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `j_prev + 2`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, either `k` is `j + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no change in `k` since there is no else part. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
