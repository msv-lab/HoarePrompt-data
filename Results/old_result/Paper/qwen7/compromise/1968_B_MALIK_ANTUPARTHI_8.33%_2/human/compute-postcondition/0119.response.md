Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b. For each test case, it searches for the first occurrence of each character in string a within string b, updating a position index k accordingly. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of k for each case.**
