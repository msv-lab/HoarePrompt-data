Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is an index, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is 0, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user, and if `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains as `j`. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is an index, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is unchanged, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]` and `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` equals `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is an index, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is incremented by 1, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user. If `d[j]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus `k`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
