Postcondition: `j` is 3, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is either 4 (if the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or `k` is `e.index(d[3]) + 1` (if the condition is false), or `k` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
