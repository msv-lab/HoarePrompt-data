Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `k` is `j + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `b`, `j`, or `k`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. The conditions and values of `j` and `k` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
