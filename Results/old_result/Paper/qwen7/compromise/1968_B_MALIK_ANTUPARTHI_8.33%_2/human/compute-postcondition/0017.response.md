Postcondition: **`k` is an index, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is 0, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user, and if `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains as `j`. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
