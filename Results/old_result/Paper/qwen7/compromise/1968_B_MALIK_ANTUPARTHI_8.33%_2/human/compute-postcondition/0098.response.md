Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `k` is `j + 2`**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` was previously defined as `j_prev + 1`, the new value of `k` becomes `j_prev + 2`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
