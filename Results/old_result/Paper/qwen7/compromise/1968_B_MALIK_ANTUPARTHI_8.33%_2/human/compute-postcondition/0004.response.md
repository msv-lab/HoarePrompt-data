Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user.**

The code `e = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `e`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
