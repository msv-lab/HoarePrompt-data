Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of any substring. The provided code only includes two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's analyze these functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single binary string and calculates the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's. It counts the number of '0's that are immediately followed by at least one '1'. Each such '0' contributes to the cost as it needs to be shifted to the left until it reaches the beginning of the string.
   - However, this function does not account for the actual minimum cost required to sort the string through cyclic shifts. Instead, it calculates a different metric which is not relevant to the problem's requirement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string via cyclic shifts, `func_2` also does not provide the correct solution.

Given that both functions do not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
