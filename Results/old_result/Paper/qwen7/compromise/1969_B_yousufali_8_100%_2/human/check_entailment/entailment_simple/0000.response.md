### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It iterates through the string and counts the occurrences of '0' that follow at least one '1'.
   - For each such occurrence, it adds `n + 1` to the answer, where `n` is the count of '1's seen so far.
   - This logic does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`, which processes the binary string `s` but does not account for the minimum cost of sorting the string using cyclic shifts.
   - Therefore, `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The given solution does not implement this logic correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the minimum cost of sorting the string using cyclic shifts.

### Correctness:
**False**
