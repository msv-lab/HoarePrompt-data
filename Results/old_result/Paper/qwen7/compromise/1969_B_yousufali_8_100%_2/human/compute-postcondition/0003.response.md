The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a binary string `s` is provided where the length of `s` is between 2 and 200,000 characters, and each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The function does not return a specific value but processes the input based on the given constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and for each test case, process a binary string `s` of length between 2 and 200,000 characters containing only '0's and '1's.
