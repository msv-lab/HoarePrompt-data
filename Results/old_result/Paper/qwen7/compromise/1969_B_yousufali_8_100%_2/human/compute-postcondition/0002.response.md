Output State: **t remains the same; s remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The given loop does not contain any operations that modify the variables `t` or `s`. Since `func_1()` is called within the loop but its implementation is not provided, we cannot assume any changes to `t` or `s`. Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will still be the initial value of the input integer, and `s` will still be the initial binary string provided.
