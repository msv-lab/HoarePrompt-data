Output State: **`shapes` is either (0 + (d[j] // 3)) or 0 + (d[j] // 3), `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered excluding the current `j`, and `j` is the next element in the updated `pl` that satisfies d[j] >= 3.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` increments the value of `shapes` by `d[j] // 3`. Since `shapes` was initially either `0 + (d[j] // 3)` or `0`, it now becomes `0 + (d[j] // 3)` after the increment. The other variables (`d`, `pl`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
