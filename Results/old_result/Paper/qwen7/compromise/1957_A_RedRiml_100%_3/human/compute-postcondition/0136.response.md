Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` which is taken from the list `palka`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `palka`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `palka` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `d` is a dictionary.
   - For each integer `i` from `palka`, if `i` is not in `d`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` is already in `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` (an integer from `palka`) has been processed.
   - The list `palka` now has one less element since one element has been used in the loop.
   - The dictionary `d` may have been updated based on the value of `i`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `palka` was a non-empty list, after removing one element, it still contains at least one element.
   - Therefore, `palka` must now be a non-empty list of integers.
   - The dictionary `d` remains unchanged in terms of its structure but may have been updated with the count of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `palka` has one less element and `d` remains a dictionary with updated counts.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers, and `d` is a dictionary.**
