Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers; `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `d.get(i)` is not None, it means that `i` is a key in the dictionary `d`. The initial state tells us that `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, which remains unchanged. The only change is that `d[i]` is incremented by 1.
