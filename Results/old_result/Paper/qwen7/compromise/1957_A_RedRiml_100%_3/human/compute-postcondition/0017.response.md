Output State: **`palka` remains unchanged, `d` is a dictionary where, if `i` is not in `pl`, then `d.get(i)` is either `None`, in which case it is set to `1`, or it is not `None`, in which case it is incremented by `1`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` adds the element `i` to the list `pl`. However, the initial state condition specifies that `palka` must contain at least one element and remains unchanged. Since `palka` is not affected by this operation, its state remains the same. The dictionary `d` is updated according to the given postcondition: if `i` is not in `pl`, `d.get(i)` is set to `1`; otherwise, it is incremented by `1`. Since `i` is now in `pl`, the value of `d.get(i)` will be incremented by `1` if it was not `None` before.
