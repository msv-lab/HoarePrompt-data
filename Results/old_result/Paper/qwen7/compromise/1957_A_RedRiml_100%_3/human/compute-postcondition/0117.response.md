Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `d` is a dictionary, and the value of `d.get(i)` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `d.get(i)` was previously `None`, after executing the code, `d.get(i)` will now be 1. The list `palka` and the rest of the dictionary `d` remain unchanged.
