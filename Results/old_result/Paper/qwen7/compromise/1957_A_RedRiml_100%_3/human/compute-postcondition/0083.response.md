Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value set to 1, `pl` contains the next element of `i`, and `i` is the next element in `palka`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to 1. This means that if `i` was not already a key in `d`, it is now added with a value of 1. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1 (though the problem does not specify this case, so we assume it's being added). The values of `pl` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
