Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `palka`. The values of `t`, `w`, `_`, and `ln` remain unchanged.
