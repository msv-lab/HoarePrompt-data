Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop iterates over the list `palka`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - `palka` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `d` is a dictionary.
   - If the key `i` is not in the dictionary `d`, then `d[i]` is set to 1.
   - If the key `i` is already in the dictionary `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element `i` in `palka`, the value of `i` will change with each iteration.
   - The dictionary `d` will be updated based on the value of `i`.

4. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `palka` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `d` is a dictionary where if the key `i` is not present, it is set to 1, otherwise, it is incremented.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` from `palka` will be taken.
   - The dictionary `d` will be updated according to the new value of `i`.

Given the above points, let's assume the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `x` (where `x` is an integer from `palka`). The next value of `i` will be the next integer in the list `palka`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

- `palka` remains the same non-empty list of integers.
- `d` will be updated based on the next value of `i` from `palka`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration can be described as:

State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers, and `d` is a dictionary. If the key `i` (next value from `palka`) is not in the dictionary `d`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. If the key `i` is already in the dictionary `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

This ensures that the loop can continue executing with the next value of `i` from `palka`.
