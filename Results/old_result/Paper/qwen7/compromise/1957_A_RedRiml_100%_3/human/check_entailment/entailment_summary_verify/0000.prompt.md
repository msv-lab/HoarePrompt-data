You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `t` indicating the number of sticks, followed by `t` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. It calculates and prints the total number of shapes that can be formed, where each shape requires at least three sticks of the same length. The final state of the program is the output of the total number of such shapes for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed. Specifically, the program counts the number of sides available for each stick length and divides by 3 to determine the number of polygons, but this approach does not account for the fact that the number of polygons is limited by the minimum number of sets of three sticks of the same length.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` as well, because we can form one pentagon with side length 2 (using 5 sticks of length 2) and one square with side length 4 (using 4 sticks of length 4). However, the program does not handle the scenario where the number of sticks of a particular length is less than the required number of sides for forming a polygon. For instance, if we had the input:
```
1
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 5
```

The program would still output `2`, but we can only form one pentagon with side length 2 and no square with side length 4, so the correct answer should be `1`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
