Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` was initially equal to `m-1`. After executing `j += 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, making it equal to `m`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
