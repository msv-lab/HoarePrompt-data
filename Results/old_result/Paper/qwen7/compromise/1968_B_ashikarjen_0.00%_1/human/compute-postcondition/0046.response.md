Output State: `j` is equal to `m`, and `m` is greater than `0`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` until `j` equals `m` or `b[j]` becomes equal to `a[i]`. Since the loop executes until `j` reaches `m` (as indicated by the output state after 3 iterations), it means that either `b[j]` became equal to `a[i]` for some `j < m` or `j` simply reached `m` without finding any match. In either case, when `j` equals `m`, the condition `j < m` in the loop head fails, and the loop terminates. Therefore, the final state is `j` being equal to `m` and `m` remaining greater than `0`.
