Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.
3. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time**: 
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]` must still be true.
   - Since `j` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `j + 1` must still be less than `m` and `b[j + 1]` must still be not equal to `a[i]`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `j + 1` is less than `m` and `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

**Final State**:
- `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.
- After incrementing `j` by 1, `j + 1` must still be less than `m` and `b[j + 1]` must still be not equal to `a[i]`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `j + 1` is less than `m` and `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
