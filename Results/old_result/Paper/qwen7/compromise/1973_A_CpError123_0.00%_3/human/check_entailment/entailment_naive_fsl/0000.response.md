Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total points are odd, which is a critical condition as the total points must be even for the scores to be consistent. The program checks for this condition but incorrectly continues to the next steps without properly handling the case where the total points are odd, leading to incorrect results for such cases. For example, in the input `(1, 1, 10)`, the total points `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` are even, but the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Instead, it incorrectly prints `2` without considering the constraints properly.
