Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes the number of test cases and the test cases themselves.
2. The function `func_1` processes each test case to determine the maximum number of draws.
3. The logic within `func_1` checks several conditions:
   - If the total points are odd, it immediately returns -1 because an odd total cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules.
   - It calculates the total number of matches from the total points.
   - It checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 or if the highest score exceeds the total number of matches, which would also make the scores invalid.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula derived from the scoring system.
4. The program correctly handles the constraints and scoring rules as described in the problem statement.
5. The output format matches the expected output, printing `-1` for invalid cases and the calculated number of draws for valid cases.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
