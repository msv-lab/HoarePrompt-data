### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the size of the permutation.

2. **Querying for Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_0 | p_i)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`. This step aims to find the index `i` such that `p_0 | p_i` is maximized.

3. **Finding Indices with Maximum XOR:**
   - It initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` as a list containing 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_m | p_i)` with `(p_mx | p_i)`.
     - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` and sets `mx` to `i`.
     - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `v`.
   - After finding potential candidates, it selects the first candidate `mx` and iterates through the list `v` to find the index `ans` such that `(p_ans | p_ans)` is greater than `(p_mx | p_mx)`.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the solution.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Maximum OR Value:**
   - The logic for finding `ans1` is flawed. It compares `(p_0 | p_i)` with `(p_i | p_i)`, but this doesn't necessarily maximize the OR value. Instead, it should compare different pairs of indices to find the maximum OR value.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Candidates:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum XOR value among candidates is also flawed. It should compare pairs of indices from the list `v` to find the maximum XOR value, not just the OR value.

3. **Number of Queries:**
   - The program makes more than 3n queries, which violates the problem constraints. The number of queries should be limited to 3n.

#### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Finding Maximum OR Value:**
  - The current implementation only checks `(p_0 | p_i)` against `(p_i | p_i)`. This does not guarantee that we find the maximum OR value. We need to compare different pairs of indices to ensure we get the maximum OR value.

- **Finding Maximum XOR Value:**
  - The current implementation only checks `(p_ans | p_ans)` against `(p_mx | p_mx)`. This does not guarantee that we find the maximum XOR value. We need to compare different pairs of indices from the list `v` to ensure we get the maximum XOR value.

- **Query Count:**
  - The current implementation makes more than 3n queries, which is not allowed. We need to optimize the number of queries to ensure we stay within the limit.

#### Correct Approach:

1. **Finding Maximum OR Value:**
   - We need to compare different pairs of indices to find the maximum OR value. This can be done by comparing `(p_a | p_b)` against `(p_c | p_d)` for different pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`.

2. **Finding Maximum XOR Value:**
   - Once we have the maximum OR value, we need to find the pair of indices that gives this maximum OR value. We can then check the XOR of these indices to find the maximum XOR value.

3. **Optimizing Queries:**
   - We need to ensure that the number of queries does not exceed 3n. This can be achieved by carefully designing the queries to minimize the number of comparisons.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem according to the problem description. The logic for finding the maximum OR and XOR values is flawed, and the number of queries exceeds the allowed limit.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
