Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements in the permutation \(p\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) to find an index `i` such that the bitwise OR of `p_0` and `p_i` is maximized. This is done using the `func_1` function, which compares `(p_a \mid p_b)` with `(p_c \mid p_d)` and returns the result of the comparison.
   - After finding `ans1`, it initializes `mx` to 0 and a list `v` containing 0. It then iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) again to find an index `i` such that the bitwise OR of `p_mx` and `p_i` is maximized. If `(p_mx \mid p_i) < (p_ans1 \mid p_i)`, it resets `v` and updates `mx` and `v`. If `(p_mx \mid p_i) == (p_ans1 \mid p_i)`, it appends `i` to `v`.
   - From the list `v`, it selects an index `ans` such that the bitwise OR of `p_ans` and `p_ans1` is maximized.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `ans` and `ans1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the index `ans1` such that `(p_0 \mid p_{ans1})` is maximized.
   - The program then attempts to find another index `ans` such that `(p_{ans} \mid p_{ans1})` is maximized.
   - However, the logic to find `ans` from the list `v` is flawed. The program only checks the bitwise OR with `p_ans1` but does not ensure that `p_ans \oplus p_ans1` is maximized. Instead, it just checks if `(p_mx \mid p_i) > (p_ans1 \mid p_i)`, which does not guarantee that `p_i \oplus p_ans1` is maximized.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly identify the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i \oplus p_j` is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
