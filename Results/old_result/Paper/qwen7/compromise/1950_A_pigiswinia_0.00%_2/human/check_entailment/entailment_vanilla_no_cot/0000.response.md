Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a minor typo in the output statement for the "STAIR" condition. It should be `print('STAIR')` instead of `print('STAIRS')`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

With this correction, the program will produce the correct output as specified in the problem description.
