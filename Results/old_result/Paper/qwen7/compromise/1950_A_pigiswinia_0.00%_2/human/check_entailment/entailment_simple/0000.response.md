Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The program checks if the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`), and prints the corresponding string ("STAIRS" or "PEAK").
4. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
5. The conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are correctly implemented using chained comparisons.
6. The program handles all test cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
