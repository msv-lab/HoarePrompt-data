Postcondition: `match_c` is either True or False depending on whether the first character of `template` matches the corresponding character in `c`. If the characters do not match, `match_c` is set to False and `i` is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the characters match, the original value of `match_c` is retained.
