Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `template` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `template`. This does not affect the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
