Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, and the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` sets the value of `match_c` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
