Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is either True or False depending on whether the character at index `i` in `c` matches the character at the same index in `template` (ignoring case). If `c[i] != template[i]`, `match_c` becomes False and `i` is `n-1`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i] == template[i]` (ignoring case), `match_c` remains True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
