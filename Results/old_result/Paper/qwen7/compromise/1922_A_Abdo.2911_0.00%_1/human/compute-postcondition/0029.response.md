Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter. Additionally, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not equal `template[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `match_a_b = False` changes the value of `match_a_b` from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and the conditions about `template[i]`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]`) remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
