Output State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 3, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace**.

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The values of `match_c`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
