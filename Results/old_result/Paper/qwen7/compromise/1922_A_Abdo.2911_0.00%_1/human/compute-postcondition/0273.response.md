Postcondition: `match_a_b` is a boolean value indicating whether the elements at index `i` in arrays `a` and `b` match the corresponding element in `template`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1, with `n` still being greater than `i + 1`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, `match_a_b` is set to `True` or `False` based on whether `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. In all cases, `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
