Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is set to `n` initially.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - The variables `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `c`, and `template` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
