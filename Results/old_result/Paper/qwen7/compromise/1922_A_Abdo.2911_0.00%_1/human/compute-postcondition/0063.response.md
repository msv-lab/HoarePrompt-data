Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `match_a_b` remains True, indicating that no mismatches were found throughout the entire loop. The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, meaning the loop has checked each element up to the last index. Additionally, it is guaranteed that `n` (the number of iterations) is greater than 0, as the loop would not run at all if `n` were 0.
