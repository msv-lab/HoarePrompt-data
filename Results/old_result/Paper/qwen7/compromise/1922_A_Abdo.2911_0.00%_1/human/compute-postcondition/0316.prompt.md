Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_c` is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If the first character of `template` is a lowercase letter, then `match_c` becomes False. Otherwise, `match_c` remains True, and `i` becomes 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `match_c` is either True or False depending on whether the first character of `template` matches the corresponding character in `c` in lowercase. If the characters do not match, `match_c` is set to False and `i` remains 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the characters match, `match_c` retains its original value and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `match_c` is either `True` or `False`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), then `match_c` is set to `False` and `i` is 1, indicating that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` equals `template[i]` (ignoring case), then `match_c` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented such that it is still less than `n`. If `c[i].lower() != template[i].lower()`, `match_c` remains `False` and the loop or if statement continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
