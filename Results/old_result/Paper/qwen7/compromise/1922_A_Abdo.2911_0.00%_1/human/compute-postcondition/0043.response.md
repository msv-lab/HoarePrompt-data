Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `match_a_b` or `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no loop or conditional statement was specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
