Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, `i` is `n-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `match_a_b`, `match_c`, or `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the implied context. The precondition remains unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the loop or conditional.
