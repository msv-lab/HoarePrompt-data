Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be checked against `n`.

5. **Consider the Postcondition**: The postcondition mentions that if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` becomes `False`. However, this does not affect the loop continuation condition directly. It only affects the value of `match_a_b`.

6. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`. The value of `match_a_b` might change based on the conditions inside the loop, but it is not part of the loop head.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`match_a_b` is True (or False if it changed), `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
