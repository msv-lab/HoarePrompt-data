Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to focus on these two variables.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Determine the changes at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` was 1.
   - `n` is still a positive integer (it doesn't change within the loop unless explicitly modified).

5. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented from 1 to 2.

6. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must still be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

7. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be a positive integer, but specifically, it must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2**
