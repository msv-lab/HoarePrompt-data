Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `match_a_b` is True.
   - `match_c` is determined based on the characters at index `i` in `c` and `template`.
   - `i` remains `n-1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `n`.

5. **Update the necessary states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n`.
   - `match_c` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `match_a_b` remains True.
   - `match_c` will be determined based on the new value of `i` (which is now `n`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is determined as follows: if the character at index `n` in `c` does not match the character at the same index in `template` (ignoring case), `match_c` is False. Otherwise, `match_c` is True, `i` is `n`**.
