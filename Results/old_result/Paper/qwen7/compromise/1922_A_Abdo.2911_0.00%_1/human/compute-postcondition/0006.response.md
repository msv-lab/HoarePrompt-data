Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value from the current line of input, `template` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `template`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
