State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `n >= 1` must be true because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
4. The initial value of `match_c` (which is True) does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
