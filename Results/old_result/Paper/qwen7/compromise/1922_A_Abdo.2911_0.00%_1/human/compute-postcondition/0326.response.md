Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function does not explicitly return anything but processes the given inputs according to the specified conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instructions.
