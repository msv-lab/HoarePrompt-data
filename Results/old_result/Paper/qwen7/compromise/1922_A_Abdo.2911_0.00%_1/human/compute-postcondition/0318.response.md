Based on the initial state provided:

- `match_c` is either `True` or `False`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The condition `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` is true.

Given that the condition `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` is true, it implies that `match_a_b` must be `True` and `match_c` must be `False`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
