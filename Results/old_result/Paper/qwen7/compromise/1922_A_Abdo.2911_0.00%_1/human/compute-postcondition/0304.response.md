Postcondition: `match_c` is either True or False depending on whether the first character of `template` matches the corresponding character in `c` in lowercase. If the characters do not match, `match_c` is set to False and `i` remains 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the characters match, `match_c` retains its original value and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
