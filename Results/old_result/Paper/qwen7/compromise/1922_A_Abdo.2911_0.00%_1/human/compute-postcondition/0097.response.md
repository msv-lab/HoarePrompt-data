Output State: **match_a_b is True, match_c is True or False based on the comparison of characters in `c` and `template` throughout the entire loop.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `match_c` will be `True` if every character in `template` (considering case insensitivity) matches the corresponding character in `c`, otherwise, it will be `False`. The variable `i` starts from `n-1` and gets decremented with each iteration but is not used inside the loop to modify its value. Therefore, its final value will be `0` after the loop completes, but this does not affect the output state's description since the question focuses on the final values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`.
