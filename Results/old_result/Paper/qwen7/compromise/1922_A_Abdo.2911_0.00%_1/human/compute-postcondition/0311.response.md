Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the initial state indicates that `i` is 1 or incremented such that it is still less than `n`, and there is a `break` statement, `i` will be set to 1 (if it wasn't already) and the loop or conditional block will be exited. The value of `match_c` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the `break` statement.
