Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character from `a` to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template.
4. After constructing the template, it checks if both `a` and `b` match the template according to the specified rules. This is done using the variable `match_a_b`.
5. It also checks if `c` does not match the template using the variable `match_c`.
6. If the template matches `a` and `b` but does not match `c`, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Based on the provided execution summary and the detailed analysis above, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
