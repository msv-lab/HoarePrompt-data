Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly initializes variables and reads the necessary inputs for each test case.
2. It constructs a template based on the comparison between `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
4. It then checks if `c` does not match the constructed template.
5. The logic for constructing the template and checking the conditions is correct.
6. The program iterates through all test cases and prints the appropriate output for each case.

Given the explanation and the structure of the program, the logic appears to be sound and should produce the correct output based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
