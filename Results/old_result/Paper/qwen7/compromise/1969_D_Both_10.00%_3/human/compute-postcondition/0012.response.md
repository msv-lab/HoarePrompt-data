Output State: **`sub_summ' is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must contain at least one element, and the current value of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `sub_summ` by adding the value of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to it. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sub_summ` now includes the additional value of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`.
