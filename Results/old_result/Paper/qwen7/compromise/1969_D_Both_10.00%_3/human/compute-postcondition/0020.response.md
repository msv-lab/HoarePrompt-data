Output State: **`sub_summ` is `sub_sum` + `val_b[0]` + `val_b[1]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must contain at least one element and will have one less element than before.**

Explanation: The code updates `sub_summ` by adding `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
