Postcondition: `sub_summ` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must contain at least one element, and if `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is updated to include `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`.
