Output State: **`sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0] + val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `val_a` is the third element in the original `sec_arr`**.

Explanation: Initially, `sub_summ` is set to `val_a[0] + val_a[0]`. After executing `sub_summ += val_a[0]`, `sub_summ` is updated to `val_a[0] + val_a[0] + val_a[0]`. The values of `sec_arr` and `val_a` remain unchanged.
