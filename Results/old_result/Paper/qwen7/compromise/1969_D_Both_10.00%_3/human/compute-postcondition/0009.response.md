Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `main_ar` using the variable `val_b`.
   - The key variables here are `val_b` and `main_ar`.

2. **Understand the Purpose of the Loop:**
   - The loop is intended to process each element in `main_ar`.
   - `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, and `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr` that was processed by the loop.
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`.

3. **Determine Initial States:**
   - `sec_arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr` that will be processed by the loop.
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `main_ar` must contain at least one element. If `main_ar` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - Since `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr` that will be processed, `sec_arr` must be non-empty and contain at least one tuple.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and execute at least once. Therefore, we need to adjust the states such that `main_ar` contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must contain at least one element.**
