Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sub_summ` will hold the sum of the first elements (`val_a[0]`) of all elements in `sec_arr`. The list `sec_arr` must still be non-empty, and `val_a` will be the last element that was processed in the loop.
