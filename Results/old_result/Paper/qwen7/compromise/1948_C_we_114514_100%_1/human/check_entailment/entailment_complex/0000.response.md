### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the robot can reach cell (2, n).
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `n//2 - 1`) and checks for invalid configurations where the robot would be unable to progress due to conflicting arrows.
   - Specifically, it checks if the robot would get stuck in a loop or be unable to move forward.
   - The function returns 'No' if any invalid configuration is detected and 'Yes' otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Problem Description and Constraints:**
   - The problem requires determining if the robot can reach cell (2, n) based on the given grid configuration.
   - The grid is 2 rows by `n` columns, with arrows pointing left ('<') or right ('>'). 
   - The robot starts at (1, 1) and moves according to the arrows.
   - The solution must handle up to `10^4` test cases, each with `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `n` being even.

4. **Function `func_1` Implementation Evaluation:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies invalid configurations that prevent the robot from reaching (2, n).
   - The function handles the even nature of `n` and checks for conflicts in the grid.
   - The implementation is consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Function `func_2` Implementation Evaluation:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes each test case and calls `func_1` appropriately.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.
   - The implementation is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, both functions together correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n) for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
