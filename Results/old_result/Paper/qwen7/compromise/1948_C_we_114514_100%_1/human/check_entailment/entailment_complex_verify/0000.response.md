### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the original assessment in detail.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Logic and Conditions**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by checking specific conditions related to the arrows in the grid.
   - It iterates over pairs of cells in `row1` and `row2` to check if any pair of arrows points towards each other.
   - If any such pair is found, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks the last two cells of `row1` and `row2` separately and returns 'No' if both are pointing left.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step across the entire grid.
   - It does not handle cases where the robot needs to move up or down multiple times to reach the target cell.
   - The function only checks specific conditions and does not account for all possible paths the robot might take.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - It constructs the results list and prints the results in the required format.

2. **Overall Behavior**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results for each case.
   - However, the correctness of the results depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
```
Input:
4
6
>>><<<
><>>><
```

- The provided solution would incorrectly return "Yes" because it does not properly simulate the robot's path.
- The correct path for this case is:
  - Start at (1, 1)
  - Move right to (1, 2)
  - Move right to (1, 3)
  - Move left to (1, 2)
  - Move right to (1, 3)
  - Move right to (1, 4)
  - Move right to (1, 5)
  - Move right to (1, 6)
  - Move down to (2, 6)

This path shows that the robot can indeed reach (2, 6), but the provided solution fails to correctly simulate this path.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid and does not handle all possible configurations of arrows. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment.
