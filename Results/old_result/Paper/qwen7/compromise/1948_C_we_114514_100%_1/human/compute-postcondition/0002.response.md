Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even, `row1` and `row2` are strings consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either '<' or '>', `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, `row1`, or `row2`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
