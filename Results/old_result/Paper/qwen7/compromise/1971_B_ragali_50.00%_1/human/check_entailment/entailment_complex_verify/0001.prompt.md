You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `s` is the original input string, `i` is the last character of `s`, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`, and `isreverse` is the reversed version of `s` if the length of `a` is greater than 1. If the length of `a` is 1, `isreverse` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If so, it rearranges the string into two halves and prints either the second half followed by the first half, the reversed string, or the original string based on certain conditions. If the string contains only one unique character, it simply prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - The program uses a set `a` to store unique characters in the string `s`.
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in the string `s`.

3. **Generating New String `r`:**
   - If there are at least two different characters, the program attempts to generate a new string `r` that is different from `s`.
   - It does this by splitting the string into two halves and rearranging them.
     - `newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]` creates a new string by swapping the halves.
     - `isreverse = s[::-1]` reverses the string `s`.
   - It then checks if either `newstr` or `isreverse` is different from `s` and prints the appropriate result.

4. **Handling Strings with Only One Character:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means the string `s` consists of only one character, and thus it's impossible to create a new string `r` that is different from `s`. In this case, the program correctly prints "NO".

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the string length is odd. When the length is odd, `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]` will still produce a string that is essentially the same as `s` because the middle character remains in place.
   - For example, if `s = "abcde"`, `newstr = "cdeabc"` which is not necessarily different from `s`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Rearrangement:**
   - The logic for generating `newstr` and checking for differences is flawed. The approach of simply swapping halves or reversing the string may not always yield a different string, especially for short strings.

### Corrected Approach:
To ensure the generated string `r` is different from `s`, we need a more robust method. Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        if len(set(s)) > 1:
            print("YES")
            # Generate a new string by swapping the first and last characters
            newstr = s[-1] + s[1:-1] + s[0]
            if newstr != s:
                print(newstr)
            else:
                # Try another approach if the above fails
                newstr = s[1:] + s[0]
                if newstr != s:
                    print(newstr)
                else:
                    print("NO")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has issues with handling odd-length strings and the logic for generating a different string. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.
