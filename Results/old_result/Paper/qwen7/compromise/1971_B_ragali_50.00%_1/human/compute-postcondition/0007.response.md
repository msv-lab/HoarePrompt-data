Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string without leading or trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing the first character of the original string `s` and the added character `i`.**

Explanation: The code `a.add(i)` adds the character `i` to the set `a`. Initially, `a` contains the first character of the string `s`. Since `i` is not specified, it is assumed to be a character that needs to be added to the set `a`. Therefore, after executing the code, the set `a` will contain both the first character of `s` and the character `i`.
