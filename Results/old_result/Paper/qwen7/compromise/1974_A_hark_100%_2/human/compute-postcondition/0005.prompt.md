You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed during each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the value printed depends on the inputs `x` and `y` provided by the `input().split()` function. If both `x` and `y` are positive, the output is calculated based on the formulas involving ceiling functions and arithmetic operations with `x` and `y`. If only one of them is positive, the output is either the ceiling of `y/2` or `x/15`, depending on which variable is positive. If both are zero, the output is 0. The exact sequence of outputs will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y` entered during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers between 0 and 99. The function does not return any specific value but rather processes these inputs according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
