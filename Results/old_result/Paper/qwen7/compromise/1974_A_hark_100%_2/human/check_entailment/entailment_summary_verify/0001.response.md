### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place icons on screens where each screen is a 5x3 grid.
   - Icons can be either 1x1 or 2x2.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code starts by calling `func_1()`, which is defined later.
   - `func_1()` takes input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - The logic inside the function is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

3. **Breaking Down the Logic:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing all 1x1 icons.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the remaining 1x1 icons after accounting for the space taken by 2x2 icons.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - The total number of screens is `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0:
     - The number of screens needed is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0:
     - The number of screens needed is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
     - No screens are needed, so the result is 0.

4. **Testing the Logic:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement matches the logic implemented in the code.
   - For instance, for the test case `(1, 1)`, the code correctly calculates that one screen is needed.
   - Similarly, for the test case `(7, 2)`, the code correctly calculates that one screen is needed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like when `x` or `y` is zero correctly.
   - It also correctly calculates the number of screens needed for mixed cases.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a logical error in the calculation of the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not accurately reflect the space taken by the 2x2 icons. 

Each 2x2 icon actually takes up 4 cells, not 15. Therefore, the correct adjustment should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4 + y * 4`.

Let's correct this and re-evaluate the logic:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 4 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
```

With this correction, let's re-run the example test cases:

- For `(1, 1)`: 
  - `bxsfory = 1`
  - `x = 1 - 1*4 + 1*4 = 1`
  - `bxsfory1 = 1`
  - Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (incorrect, should be 1)

- For `(7, 2)`: 
  - `bxsfory = 1`
  - `x = 7 - 1*4 + 2*4 = 11`
  - `bxsfory1 = 1`
  - Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (incorrect, should be 1)

- For `(12, 4)`: 
  - `bxsfory = 2`
  - `x = 12 - 2*4 + 4*4 = 16`
  - `bxsfory1 = 2`
  - Total screens = `2 + 2 = 4` (incorrect, should be 2)

The corrected logic still does not match the expected results. The original assessment was incorrect due to the flawed calculation of the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness:** **False**

Final: **False**
