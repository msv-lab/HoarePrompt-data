Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns the maximum value between the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for each `i` in the range of `n`.**
