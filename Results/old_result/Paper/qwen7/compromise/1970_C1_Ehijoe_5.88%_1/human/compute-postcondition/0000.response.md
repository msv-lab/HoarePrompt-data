Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5; `n` is updated to the integer input from the user, and `t` is updated to the integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, t = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. Since the initial state specified that `t` is 1, the value of `t` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input from the user, which also satisfies the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5. The values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input.
