Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` is an input integer, `u` is `min(t, idx)`, `v` is `min(t, n - idx - 1)`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `tree` is a deque with elements added based on the given conditions, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`**.

Explanation: The code initializes the list `moves` with two elements. The first element is `min(t, idx)` and the second element is `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. The variables `empty`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `tree`, `start`, and `idx` retain their previous values. The values of `u` and `v` are specifically defined based on the minimum function applied to `t` and the respective indices.
