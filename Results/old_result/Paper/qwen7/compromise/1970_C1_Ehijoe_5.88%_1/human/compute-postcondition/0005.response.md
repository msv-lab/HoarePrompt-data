Output State: `empty` is False, `t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `tree` is a deque with elements added based on the given conditions. The `tree` deque will contain pairs of integers `(u, v)` or `(v, u)` depending on their positions in the input, with the first element always being `u` and the second element being `v` or vice versa if they match the conditions specified in the loop.
