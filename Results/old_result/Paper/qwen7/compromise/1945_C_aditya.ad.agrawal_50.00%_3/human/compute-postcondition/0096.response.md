Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 4, `o_l` is 0 more than its original value, `o_r` is 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 1 more than its original value, `ans` is 2, `z_r` is 1 less than its original value**.

Explanation: The code `z_r -= 1` decrements the value of `z_r` by 1. Since `z_r` was originally `z_l + 1`, after the operation, `z_r` becomes `z_l`. Therefore, `z_r` is now 1 less than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
