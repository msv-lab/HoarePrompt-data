The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been decreased by 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `t` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the modified state should be:

State: **`t` must be non-zero, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `o_l` is the total count of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total count of 0s in `arr`, `ans` is the position that minimizes the distance to `n/2` while satisfying the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is the minimum absolute difference between `n/2` and any position that meets the conditions, and `z_r` is 0.**
