Output State: **`i` is the fourth element of `arr`; `pos` is 1**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is set to the third element of `arr`. The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Since `pos` was initially 0 (as it is the index of the third element), after the increment, `pos` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided.
