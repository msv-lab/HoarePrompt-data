Output State: **`input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0**.

The code `o_l = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `o_l`. This does not affect any other variables or the initial state of `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, and `o_r`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values.
