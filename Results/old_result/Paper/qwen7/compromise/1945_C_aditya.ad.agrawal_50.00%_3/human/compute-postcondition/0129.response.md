Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers converted from `input_string`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `o_l` is 0, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `ans` is the position that minimizes the distance to `n/2` while satisfying the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is the minimum absolute difference between `n/2` and any position that meets the conditions, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `n` is an input integer, and `input_string` is the input read from the user; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the total count of 1s in `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `o_l = 0` sets the variable `o_l` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
