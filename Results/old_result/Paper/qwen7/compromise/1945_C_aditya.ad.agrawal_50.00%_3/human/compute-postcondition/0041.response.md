Postcondition: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`, `z_l` and `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 0, and `ans` is 1. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 1, `z_l` is increased by 1. If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` is 1, `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is increased by 1.**
