Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by converting each character in the string `input_string` into an integer. The characters are assumed to represent digits (0-9). The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `input_string` retains its original value as a string.
