Output State: **`input_string` is a string read from input, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code reads a string from the input using `input()`, and assigns it to the variable `input_string`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `input_string` and retains the unchanged values of the other variables.
