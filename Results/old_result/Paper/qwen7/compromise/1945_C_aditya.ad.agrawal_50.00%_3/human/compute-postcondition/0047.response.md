Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the fifth element of `arr`, `pos` is 5, `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`, `z_l` and `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 1, and `ans` is 3.**

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Initially, `pos` was 4, so after executing this line, `pos` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
