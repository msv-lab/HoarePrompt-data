Output State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` is 2**

Explanation: The initial state has `i` as the first element of `arr`. The code increments `pos` by 1. Since `pos` was initially equal to the position of the first element (which is 1), after executing `pos += 1`, `pos` becomes 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
