Postcondition: `i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` is 2, `o_l` is 0 more than its original value, and `o_r` is 1 less than its original value. `z_l` is 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value. The condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)))` is true.
