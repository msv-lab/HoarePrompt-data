Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 4, `o_l` is 1, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`**.

Explanation: The code `o_r -= 1` decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. Since `o_r` was originally 1 less than its original value, after decrementing it becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
