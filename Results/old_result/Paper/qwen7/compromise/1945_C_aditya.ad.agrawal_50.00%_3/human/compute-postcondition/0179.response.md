Output State: **`pos` is the length of `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total number of zeros in `arr`, `b_d` is 1, `ans` is `pos` minus the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
