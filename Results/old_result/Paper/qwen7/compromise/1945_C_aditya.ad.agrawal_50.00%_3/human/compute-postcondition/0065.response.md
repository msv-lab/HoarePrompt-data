Output State: **`input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` where each element is the integer value corresponding to each character in the string `input_string`. The initial state of `input_string` remains unchanged, and the new list `arr` is created based on the characters in `input_string`.
