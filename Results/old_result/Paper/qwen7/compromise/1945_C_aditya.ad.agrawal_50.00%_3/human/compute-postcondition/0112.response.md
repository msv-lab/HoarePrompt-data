Postcondition: **`i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 4, `o_l` is either 1 or 2 more than its original value, `o_r` is either 0 or -1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 2 more than its original value if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, and the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is satisfied.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the changes in the variables `o_l`, `o_r`, and `z_l` based on the value of `i`.
