Postcondition: **`input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n / 2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the total count of 0s and 1s (`(z_r + o_r) / 2`), then `b_d` is equal to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.**
