Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `z_r` is the total count of 0s in `arr` minus the count of 0s encountered up to the last element, `o_r` is the total count of 1s in `arr` minus the count of 1s encountered up to the last element, `z_l` is the count of 0s encountered up to the last element, `o_l` is the count of 1s encountered up to the last element, `b_d` is 30001 if no position satisfies the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, otherwise it is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the condition is met, and `ans` is the position where the condition is met if such a position exists, otherwise it remains 0; `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the initial conditions for the other variables remain unchanged.
