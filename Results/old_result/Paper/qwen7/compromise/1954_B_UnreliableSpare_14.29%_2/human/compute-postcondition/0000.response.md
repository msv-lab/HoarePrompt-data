Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and the array `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range [1, 10^4], and the array `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and `n`.
