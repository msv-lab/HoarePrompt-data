Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')**.

The code initializes the variable `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`. This does not affect the values of `flag`, `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
