Output State: `flag` is False, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. If the current element is equal to `val`, it increments `cnt` by 1. If the current element is not equal to `val`, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, its final value will always be 0. `ans` is initialized to a value that is greater than or equal to 0 (as it starts from 0), and it gets updated only when `cnt` is non-zero, but since `cnt` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, `ans` remains 0 throughout the loop. The other variables (`flag`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `val`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
