Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `val` and `cnt`. `val` is assigned the value of the first element in the array `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. `cnt` is initialized to 0. The states of `flag`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
