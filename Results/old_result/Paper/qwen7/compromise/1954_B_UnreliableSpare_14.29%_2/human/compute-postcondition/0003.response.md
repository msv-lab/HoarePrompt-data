Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves three variables: `i`, `n`, and the loop itself.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 (since the range is `range(1, n)`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Initial State of `n`**: The variable `n` is given as an input integer.

5. **Initial State of `arr` and `t`**: These variables (`arr` and `t`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

6. **Initial State of `flag`**: The variable `flag` being `True` does not affect the loop's execution based on the given range.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `i` should be set to 1, and `n` should be greater than or equal to 1 (since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues while `i < n`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Here is the final state:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
