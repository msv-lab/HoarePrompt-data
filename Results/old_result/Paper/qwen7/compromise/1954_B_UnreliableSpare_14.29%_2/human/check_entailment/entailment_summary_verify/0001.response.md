### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Array Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Non-Beautiful**:
   - The program checks if the array is already non-beautiful by verifying if all elements are the same. This is done using the `flag` variable.
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` remains `True`), the program prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to a very large value (`Decimal('Infinity')`) to keep track of the minimum number of removals needed.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of the same element.
   - For each change in the value, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array was initially beautiful (`flag` is `True`), the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis:

- The logic for checking if the array is already non-beautiful is correct.
- However, there is a flaw in the method used to find the minimum number of removals. The current implementation only considers the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements in a way that avoids creating new sequences of identical elements.

### Example to Illustrate the Flaw:

Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program would identify the longest sequence of identical elements as `1, 2, 1` and set `ans` to `2`. However, the correct answer should be `1`, because removing the middle `2` would break the beauty condition.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider all possible ways to break the beauty condition by removing elements. Specifically, it should look for the smallest segment that can be removed to break the sequence of identical elements.

### Revised Implementation:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    for i in range(n):
        if i > 0 and arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            ans = min(ans, i)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Revised Implementation:

- The program iterates through the array and checks for the first occurrence of a different element.
- It keeps track of the minimum index where a different element is found.
- If the array is beautiful (`flag` is `True`), it prints `-1`.
- Otherwise, it prints the minimum index where a different element is found, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. The revised implementation addresses this issue and correctly finds the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
