Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle arrays where removing elements is necessary to break the beauty condition.

Consider the following test case:
```
6
3
1 2 1
```

The expected output for this case is `1`, because we can remove the element at index 2 (value 1), making the array `[1, 2]` which is not beautiful anymore.

However, the current implementation of the program does not detect this scenario. It checks if all elements are the same and if they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and outputs that as the result. This approach does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing a single element.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing a single element, rather than just checking if all elements are identical.
