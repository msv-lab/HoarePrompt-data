You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an array `arr` to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where all elements are the same as the first element of the array. If the array is not constant (i.e., contains at least one element different from the first), it prints the minimum segment length; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Array Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Non-Beautiful**:
   - The program checks if the array is already non-beautiful by verifying if all elements are the same. This is done using the `flag` variable.
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` remains `True`), the program prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to a very large value (`Decimal('Infinity')`) to keep track of the minimum number of removals needed.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of the same element.
   - For each change in the value, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array was initially beautiful (`flag` is `True`), the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis:
- The logic for checking if the array is already non-beautiful is correct.
- The method to find the minimum number of removals is also correct. It correctly identifies the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of removals needed.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
