### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Array Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Non-Beautiful**:
   - The program checks if the array is already non-beautiful by verifying if all elements are the same. This is done using the `flag` variable.
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` remains `True`), the program prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to a very large value (`Decimal('Infinity')`) to keep track of the minimum number of removals needed.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of the same element.
   - For each change in the value, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.
     - However, there is a critical flaw in this part of the logic. The variable `cnt` is only incremented when `arr[i] == val`, and it is never reset to 0 after a change in `val`. This means that `cnt` will only capture the length of the first segment of consecutive identical elements and will not accurately reflect the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty of the array.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array was initially beautiful (`flag` is `True`), the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.
     - Given the flaw in the logic for finding the minimum number of removals, the output may be incorrect.

### Analysis:
- The logic for checking if the array is already non-beautiful is correct.
- The method to find the minimum number of removals is flawed because `cnt` is not reset to 0 after a change in `val`, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical error in determining the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful. The `cnt` variable is not reset properly, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
