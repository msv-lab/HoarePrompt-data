The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)). For each test case, it creates a list \( p \) of length \( n \) and fills it with the value \( 2n - 1 \). After processing all test cases, it prints the list \( p \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the final state of the list \( p \) for each test case.
