Output State: **`p[i+2]` is assigned the value of `ind` - 4, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, and `ind` is `ind - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ind -= 2` decreases the value of `ind` by 2. The previous value of `ind` was `ind - 2` plus 2, which simplifies to `ind`. After executing the code, `ind` becomes `ind - 2`. All other variables (`p[i+2]`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
