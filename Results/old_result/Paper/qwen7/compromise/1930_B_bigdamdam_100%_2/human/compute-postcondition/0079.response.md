Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `n` with a step of `2`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `2` until it reaches or exceeds `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is 5 (not used in the loop head, so no adjustment needed).
   - `i` is `1 + n % 2 + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `1 + n % 2 + 2`.
   - `p` is filled from index `0` to `n-1` with values from `3` down to `3 - 2 * (n // 2)`.
   - `p[1 + n % 2 + 2]` is `3`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is in the range `1` to `n` with a step of `2`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - The current value of `i` is `1 + n % 2 + 2`.

5. **Determine the new value of `n`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `n > 1 + n % 2 + 2`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `ind` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` will be updated to `i + 2`, which is `1 + n % 2 + 2 + 2 = 3 + n % 2`.
- `n` must still be greater than `3 + n % 2`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ind` is 5, `i` is 3 + n % 2, `n` must be greater than 3 + n % 2, `p` is filled from index 0 to n-1 with values from 3 down to 3 - 2 * (n // 2), and p[1 + n % 2 + 2] is 3**
