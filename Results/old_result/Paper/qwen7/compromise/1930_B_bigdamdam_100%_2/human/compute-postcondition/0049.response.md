Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over a range starting from 1 up to `n` (exclusive) with a step of 2.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is 5 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `i` is 3 (this is one of the loop variables).
   - `p[1]` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `p[3]` is 3 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2 each time (as per the step in the range), the next value of `i` would be 5.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 5 for the next iteration.
   - To allow the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 5.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `ind` is 5, `i` is 5, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `n` must be greater than 5**
