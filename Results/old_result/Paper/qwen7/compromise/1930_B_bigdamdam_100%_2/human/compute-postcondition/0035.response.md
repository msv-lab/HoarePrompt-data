Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 2 each iteration until `i` is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `ind` is decreased by 2. This suggests that `ind` might be related to `i` or `n`, but it is not directly mentioned in the loop head. Therefore, we focus on `i` and `n`.
   - We need to determine the new values of `i` and `n` for the next iteration.

4. **Determine the New Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2 each iteration, if `i` was decreased by 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i` was at its maximum value for the current iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will start from `n-2` (since it was just before incrementing to `n`).

5. **Determine the New Value of `n`**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`. If `i` was at its maximum value for the current iteration and is now decreased by 2, `n` must still be greater than `i+2` to allow the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will start from `n-2` for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than `i+2`**
