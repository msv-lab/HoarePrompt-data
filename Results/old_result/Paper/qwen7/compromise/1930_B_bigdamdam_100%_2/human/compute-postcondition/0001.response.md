Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code takes an input, splits it by spaces, and assigns the first integer to `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
