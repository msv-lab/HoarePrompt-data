Output State: `p[i]` will contain a series of values starting from `ind` and increasing by 2 for each iteration, with indices being even numbers up to `n-2`. Specifically, `p[1]` will be `ind`, `p[3]` will be `ind + 2`, `p[5]` will be `ind + 4`, and so on until `p[n-2]`. The variable `ind` will be equal to `t - (n - (n - 1))` if `n` is odd, or `t - (n - (n - 2))` if `n` is even. The variable `i` will be `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n - 2` if `n` is even.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the list `p` will have even indices filled with values starting from `ind` and incrementing by 2, and the final value of `ind` will depend on whether `n` is odd or even, and the final value of `i` will also depend on the parity of `n`.
