Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ind` is 9
   - `i` is 7
   - `p[1]` is 1
   - `p[3]` is 3
   - `p[5]` is 5
   - `p[7]` is 7

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means `i` will take values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 7. Therefore, the loop will continue if `i < int(input()) - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. So, `i` will become 8.
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the condition `i < int(input())` must still hold true. Given that `i` was 7 in the previous iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 8.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 8.
   - `ind` will be incremented by 2, so `ind` will become 11.
   - The value of `p[i]` (which is `p[8]`) will be assigned the value of `ind`, so `p[8]` will be 11.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `ind` is 11, `i` is 8, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `p[5]` is 5, `p[7]` is 7, `p[8]` is 11**
