Output State: `p[i]` is equal to `ind - 2*(n-1)` if `n` is odd, or `ind - 2*(n-2)` if `n` is even, `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n - 2` if `n` is even, and `ind` is equal to `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n - 1)` if `n` is odd, or `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n - 2)` if `n` is even.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The list `p` will have its even indices set according to the formula `ind - 2*i`, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) for even `n`, or `n-1` (inclusive) for odd `n`. The variable `ind` will be updated in each iteration, starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2 in each step until the loop condition `n > i + 2` is no longer satisfied, which happens when `i` reaches `n-1` for odd `n`, or `n-2` for even `n`.
