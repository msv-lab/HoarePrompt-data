Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n` and `i` increments by 2 each iteration starting from 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `p[i]` is equal to `ind` + 2.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, if `i` was previously `ind + 2`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `ind + 4`.

5. **Determine the new condition for the loop**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state to reflect the new value of `i` and ensure the loop condition is met.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`p[i]` is equal to `ind` + 2 where `i` is now `ind + 4` and `n` must be greater than `ind + 4`**
