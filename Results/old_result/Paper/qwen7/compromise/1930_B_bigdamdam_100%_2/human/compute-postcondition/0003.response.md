Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of n zeros, `ind` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ind`. Since `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `ind` now holds the same value as `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
