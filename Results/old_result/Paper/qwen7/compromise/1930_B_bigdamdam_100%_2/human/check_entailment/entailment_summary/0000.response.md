Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Construction of Permutation**: The program constructs a list `p` where every element is set to `2n - 1`. This means all elements in the list are the same, which violates the requirement that the list must be a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Divisibility Condition**: The program does not ensure that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. Since all elements in the list are the same (`2n - 1`), this condition is trivially satisfied, but the construction itself is incorrect.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the constructed list for each test case, but the construction method is flawed as explained above.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not generate a valid permutation according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
