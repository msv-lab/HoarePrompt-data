Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to parse the input as required.
2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the array `a` and the value `x`.
   - It iterates over the bits from 29 down to 0 (since `x` is less than \(2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position, it checks the value of `x` and the cumulative XOR of the array elements at that bit position.
   - Depending on the conditions, it either skips the current bit or updates the segments accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum number of segments `k` that satisfy the conditions or `-1` if no such segments exist.

The logic correctly handles the constraints and the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.
