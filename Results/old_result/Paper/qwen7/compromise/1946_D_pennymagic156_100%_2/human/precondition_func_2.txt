t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30, representing the length of the array a and the favorite number x respectively. a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, representing the array a itself.
