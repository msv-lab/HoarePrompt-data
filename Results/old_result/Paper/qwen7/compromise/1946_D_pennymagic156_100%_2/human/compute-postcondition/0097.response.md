Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with the next `val`, `op` is now the XOR of the original `op` with `val >> i & 1`, `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with the next `val`, and `ai` is the result of `ai ^ val`.**

Explanation: The line `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing the XOR operation between the current value of `ai` and `val`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
