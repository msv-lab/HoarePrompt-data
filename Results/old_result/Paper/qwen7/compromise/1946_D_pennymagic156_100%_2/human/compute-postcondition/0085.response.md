Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` remains unchanged and is currently `False`, `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the first element of `a` with `val`, `ai` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ai = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `ai`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `op`, or `t`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while updating `ai` to `0`.
