Output State: **`a` is not an empty iterable, `val` is the next value from `a`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `op` is updated based on the bitwise XOR of `op` and the i-th bit of `val`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` remains an iterable, `val` remains the next value from `a`, and `op` remains updated based on the bitwise XOR of `op` and the i-th bit of `val`. The new value of `cnt` is `cnt + 1`.
