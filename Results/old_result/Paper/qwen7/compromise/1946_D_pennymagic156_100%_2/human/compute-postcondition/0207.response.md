Output State: **i is 0, u is 0, and v is even.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 29` down to `i = 0`. After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 0. The conditions inside the loop do not modify `i` once it reaches 0. Therefore, `i` will be 0 at the end of the loop. Since the loop does not explicitly set `u` and `v` to any specific value when `i` is 0, they retain their last computed values, which are `u` being 0 (since the loop continues if `u` is 0) and `v` being even (as the loop ensures `v` remains even or modifies it to be even). The values of `u`, `v`, and `i` are the only ones that change within the loop head and body, and these are the only changes described in the given states. Thus, after all iterations, `i` is 0, `u` is 0, and `v` is even.
