Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `cnt` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The values of `a` and `op` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cnt` and retains the conditions for `a` and `op`.
