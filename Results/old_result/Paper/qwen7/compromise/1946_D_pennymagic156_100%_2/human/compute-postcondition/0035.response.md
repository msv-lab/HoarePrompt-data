Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all its elements processed, `ai` is 0, `t` is an empty list, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation over all elements in `a` shifted right by `i` bits and masked with 1.**

Explanation: The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `a` and `t`. Initially, `t` contains the cumulative XOR results of all elements in `a`, and `a` is a list of integers with all its elements processed. After the swap, `a` becomes an empty list, and `t` becomes the original `a`. The value of `ai` remains unchanged at 0, and the value of `op` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by this assignment.
