Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` is now `val >> i & 1` (where `i` is the current index during the iteration), and `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with `val`, and `ai` is 0, `t` now has an additional element which is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` (which is 0) to the list `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
