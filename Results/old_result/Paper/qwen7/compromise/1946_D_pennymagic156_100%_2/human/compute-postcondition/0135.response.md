Postcondition: `i` is 28, `u` is either 0 or 1, `v` is the sum of [(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a] modulo 2. If both `u` and `v` are 0, no change is made to `i`, `u`, and `v`. If `u` is 0, `a` is a list where each element has been updated by performing an XOR operation with `val`; `op` is the final value of the XOR of `val >> i & 1` for all iterations; `t` is now an empty list; `ai` is 0. If `u` is 1, `v` is either even or the sum of [(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a] modulo 2 is not 0. If `v` is odd, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation over the i-th bit of each element in `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times `op` became `False` during the loop execution, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
