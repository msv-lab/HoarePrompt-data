Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with the next `val`, `op` is now the XOR of the original `op` with `val >> i & 1`, `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with the next `val`, and `ai` is 0, `t` has an additional element appended which is the result of `ai ^ val`.**

Explanation: The code sets `ai` to 0. This updates the value of `ai` from its previous state (which was `ai ^ val`) to 0. All other variables (`a`, `op`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
