Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with `val`, `op` is False, `t` is a list containing one element which is the same as `ai`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the element `ai` from the list `a` to the list `t`. Since `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with `val`, and `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)` which is currently `False`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `t` now contains the element `ai`.
