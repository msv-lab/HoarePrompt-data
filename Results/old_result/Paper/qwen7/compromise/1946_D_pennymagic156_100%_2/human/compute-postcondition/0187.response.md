Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the state of `a`, `val`, and `op` remains unchanged, while `cnt` is incremented by 1.
