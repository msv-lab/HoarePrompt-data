Output State: **`n` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ n[1] < 2^30; `x` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ x[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x[1] < 2^30; `a` is a list of n[0] integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n[0].**

Explanation: The code `n, x = func_3()` assigns the return values of the function `func_3()` to the variables `n` and `x`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the given context, we assume it returns two values, which are assigned to `n` and `x`. Both `n` and `x` are now tuples, and their values are unspecified except for the constraints given. The list `a` remains unchanged from its initial state.
