Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers; `ai` is 0; `t` is a list containing one additional element which is 0; `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code sets `ai` to 0. Since `ai` was previously defined as `ai` XOR (val right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1), setting `ai` to 0 means that the previous definition no longer applies. The value of `val` remains unchanged as it is the next element in the list `a`. The list `t` now contains `ai` which is 0.
