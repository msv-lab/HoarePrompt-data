Output State: **`cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `i` is the last element in `cx`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`, `r` is a list with the new value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. Here, `ax - bx + 1` represents the total number of integers in the range from `bx` to `ax` inclusive, and `- tmp` subtracts the count of elements in `cx` that fall within this range. The values of `cx`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
