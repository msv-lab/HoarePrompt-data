State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop uses `range(n)` to determine how many times it should iterate.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
3. The variables `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` are not used in the loop condition, so their values do not affect whether the loop will execute or not.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` being greater than 0.

Thus, the final state is: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1**.
