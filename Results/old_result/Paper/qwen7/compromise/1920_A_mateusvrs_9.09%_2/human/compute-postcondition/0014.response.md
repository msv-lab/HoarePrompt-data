Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to 1, and the current value of `a` is 2; `ax` is min(x, 1000000007)**

Explanation: The code updates `ax` to be the minimum value between `x` and the current value of `ax` (which is 1000000007). Since `x` is an input integer and its exact value is not specified, `ax` will take the smaller value between `x` and 1000000007. All other variables remain unchanged.
