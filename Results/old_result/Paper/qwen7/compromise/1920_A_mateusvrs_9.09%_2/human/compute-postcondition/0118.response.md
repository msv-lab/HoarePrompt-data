Output State: **`ax` is 1000000007, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is an empty set, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `r` is a list with either the value 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.**

Explanation: The code sets `ax` to the value `1000000007`. This is the only change made to the variables. All other variables retain their previous states.
