Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx`.

3. **Determine the postconditions**:
   - `cx` is a non-empty set.
   - `i` is the next element in `cx`.
   - `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration plus 1.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `cx`, it will be the first element in `cx` for the next iteration.
   - `tmp` will be the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration plus 1.
   - `cx` remains the same unless the loop modifies it, but since no modification is mentioned, `cx` stays as a non-empty set.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `cx` remains a non-empty set.
   - `i` becomes the first element in `cx`.
   - `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration plus 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cx` is a non-empty set, `i` is the first element in `cx`, and `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration plus 1**.
