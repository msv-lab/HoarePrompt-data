Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(n):` statement. The key variables here are `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `n > 0`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`.
   - `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
   - `bx` is either -1 or max(`x`, -1).
   - `a` and `x` are input integers.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `n > 0`, and given that `n` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the only change needed is to decrement `n` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **New State for the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (since it was greater than 1 before and we decrement it by 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or max(`x`, -1), `a` and `x` are input integers**.
