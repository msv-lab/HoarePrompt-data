Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007**.

The code assigns the value of `1000000000.0 + 7` to `ax` after converting it to an integer. Since `1000000000.0 + 7` equals `1000000007.0`, and converting it to an integer removes the decimal part, `ax` becomes `1000000007`. The values of `n` and `cx` remain unchanged.
