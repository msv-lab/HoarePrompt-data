Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the set `cx`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the set `cx`, the initial value of `i` must be one of the elements in `cx`.

3. **Understand the Set `cx`**: The set `cx` contains all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `cx` must contain at least one element. If `cx` is empty, the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` must be initialized to an element from `cx`.
   - The set `cx` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `cx` must contain at least one element.
- `i` must be initialized to one of the elements in `cx`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is one of the elements in `cx`**.
