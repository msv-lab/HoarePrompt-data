Postcondition: **`n` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration. If `bx >= ax`, then `r` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `tmp` will be equal to the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[ax, bx]`; `r` will have the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it.**
