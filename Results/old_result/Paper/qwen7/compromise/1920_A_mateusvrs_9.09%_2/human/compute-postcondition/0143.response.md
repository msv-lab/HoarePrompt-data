Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(n)`. This means the loop variable is `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the loop index is not needed), and the loop runs `n` times.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to run as long as `n` is greater than 0. After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **`n`**: Since the loop runs `n` times and `n` is decremented by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `n` should be `n - 1`.
   - **`a` and `x`**: These variables are not modified within the loop based on the given information. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - **`bx` and `ax` and `cx`**: These variables are not directly modified by the loop itself but could be modified inside the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine changes to these variables without additional information. For the purpose of adjusting the loop state, we assume they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.
