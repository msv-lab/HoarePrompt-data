Output State: **`bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, `r` is a list containing the value 0, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.**

The code `r.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `bx >= ax` still holds true.
