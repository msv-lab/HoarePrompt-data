Output State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is one of the elements in `cx`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is `tmp` plus 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tmp` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `tmp` is not specified, we represent it as `tmp` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
