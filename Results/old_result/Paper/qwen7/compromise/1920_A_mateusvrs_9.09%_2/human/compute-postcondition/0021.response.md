Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is either 1000000007 or min(`x`, 1000000007), `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. The conditions and values of `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged from the initial state.
