Postcondition: `cx` is a non-empty set, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration plus 1, provided that `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`. If `i` is not within this range, the value of `tmp` remains unchanged from its value after the previous iteration.
