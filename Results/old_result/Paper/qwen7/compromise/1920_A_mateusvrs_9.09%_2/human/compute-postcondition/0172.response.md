Output State: **`tmp` is 4, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `a` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `x` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `ax` is the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, `cx` is an empty set since all elements satisfying the condition `i >= bx` and `i <= ax` have been iterated over, and `r` is a list with one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` appends the value of `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is incremented by 1 (since `tmp` was initially 3), making it 4. The values of `ax`, `bx`, `a`, `x`, and `cx` remain unchanged. The list `r` now contains one element, which is the calculated value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
