Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tmp` is 0, `n` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration, and `bx` is less than `ax`
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cx` is a non-empty set, `i` is an element of `cx`, and if the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is equal to the original value of `tmp` plus 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cx` is a non-empty set, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration plus 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cx` is a non-empty set, `i` is the first element in `cx`, and `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration plus 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, the condition remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, the condition also remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
