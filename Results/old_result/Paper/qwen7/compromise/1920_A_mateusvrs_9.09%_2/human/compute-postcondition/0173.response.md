Postcondition: **After all iterations, `n` will be the total number of iterations performed, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, and `x` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration. `ax` will be the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` will be the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, and `cx` will be a set containing all integers provided as `x` when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `tmp` is 4, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `a` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `x` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `ax` is the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list with one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
