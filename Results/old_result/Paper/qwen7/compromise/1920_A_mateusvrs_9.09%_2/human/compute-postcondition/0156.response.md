Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `n` will be the total number of iterations performed, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, and `x` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration. `ax` will be the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` will be the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, and `cx` will be a set containing all integers provided as `x` when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. `bx` is less than `ax`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` initializes `tmp` to 0. It does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, or `cx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
