Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bx` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `bx` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x` if `a` is not equal to 1, otherwise `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `bx` is -1, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Otherwise, `ax` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `n` is greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing `x` twice, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
