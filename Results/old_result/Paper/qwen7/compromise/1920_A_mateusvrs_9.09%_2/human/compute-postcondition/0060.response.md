Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cx` as an empty set. This means that the set `cx` now contains no elements. All other variables (`n`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, and `x`) retain their previous values from the initial state.
