Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of constraints where each constraint is defined by two integers a and x, with a being either 1, 2, or 3, and x ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function returns a result based on these constraints, ensuring that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and all constraints are unique.**
