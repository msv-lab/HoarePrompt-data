Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the set `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the set `cx`. The variable `i` is the current element being processed from the set `cx`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1.
   - `i` is the next element in `cx`.
   - `tmp` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `cx`, after processing `i`, `i` will be removed from `cx` (assuming the loop body removes or modifies `i` in some way).
   - For the loop to continue, `cx` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, after removing `i` from `cx`, `cx` should still have at least one element left.
   - `tmp` will be increased by 1 again for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `cx` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx` after the current one.
   - `tmp` will be increased by 1.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1**. 

However, since `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `cx` must still contain at least one element, we can rephrase this slightly for clarity:

State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1**. 

This ensures that the loop can continue executing with the updated values.
