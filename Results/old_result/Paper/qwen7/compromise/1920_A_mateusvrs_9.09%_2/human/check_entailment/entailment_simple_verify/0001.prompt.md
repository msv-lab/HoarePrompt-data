You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store values that `k` must not be equal to.
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (1000000007) and `bx` to -1 to keep track of the upper and lower bounds of valid `k` values.
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Validity of Constraints:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there is no valid `k`, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling Constraints:**
   - The program correctly identifies the bounds `ax` and `bx` for valid `k` values.
   - It correctly handles the exclusion of specific values using the set `cx`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program ensures that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, as required by the problem statement.
   - It correctly handles the case where `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, indicating no valid `k`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - The use of a set to store excluded values is appropriate and efficient for checking membership.

4. **Range Calculation:**
   - The calculation of the number of valid `k` values within the range `[bx, ax]` after excluding the values in `cx` is correct.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
