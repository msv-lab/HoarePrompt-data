Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - It initializes an empty set `cx` to store the values of `x` for type 3 constraints.
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000007`) and `bx` to `-1`.
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (i.e., `a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (i.e., `a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (i.e., `a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Calculating Result**:
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no overlap between the ranges `[1, ax]` and `[bx, 10^9]`, so the result is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers `k` that lie within the range `[bx, ax]` but are not in the set `cx`. This is done by iterating over the set `cx` and counting how many elements fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. The final result is the difference between `ax - bx + 1` and the count of such elements.

4. **Output**: The program appends the calculated result to the list `r` and prints the list after processing all test cases.

Given the logic and the constraints described, the program correctly computes the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
