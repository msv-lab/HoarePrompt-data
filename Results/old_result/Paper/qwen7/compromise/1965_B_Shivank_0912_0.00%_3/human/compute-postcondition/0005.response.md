Output State: **The program returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]).**

This means that the program returns a list of tuples, and each tuple within this list contains the number 25 as its first element and a list of the first 25 powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) as its second element.
