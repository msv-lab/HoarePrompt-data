Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It correctly processes the number of test cases (`t`) and pairs of integers `(n, k)` for each test case.

2. **Generating Sequences:**
   - The `func_1` function generates a fixed sequence `[2 ** i for i in range(25)]`, which is a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\).
   - This sequence has exactly 25 elements, which satisfies the constraint \(1 \le m \le 25\).

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - For each test case, the generated sequence is used without modification.
   - The sequence `[2 ** i for i in range(25)]` ensures that:
     - No subsequence sums to \(k\) because \(k\) is not a power of 2.
     - All integers from 1 to \(n\) (where \(n \geq 8\)) can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (by the binary representation property).

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The problem guarantees that a solution always exists, and the fixed sequence meets the requirements for \(n \geq 8\).
   - For smaller values of \(n\), the sequence still works because the required sums can be formed from the available elements (e.g., for \(n = 2\), the sequence `[1]` works).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence that meets the given conditions for all test cases. The fixed sequence of powers of 2 ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\) while allowing all other sums from 1 to \(n\).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
