Output State: **`sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`, `i` is within the range `[1, k]`, `sum1`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now within the range `[1, k]`.
- All other variables (`sum1`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
