Output State: **`i` is equal to 0; `ans` contains `sums`; `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Since `i` was initially equal to 0 and no changes were made to its value, `i` remains equal to 0. The list `ans` now contains the value of `sums`. The expression for `sums` remains unchanged.
