Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the same as before, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing `[sums]` if the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `ans` is appended with `sums`.**

This means that the value of `i` remains 2, `k` remains unchanged, and `sums` is updated according to the given formula. The list `ans` is appended with the current value of `sums` if the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is true. If the condition is false, `ans` remains unchanged.
