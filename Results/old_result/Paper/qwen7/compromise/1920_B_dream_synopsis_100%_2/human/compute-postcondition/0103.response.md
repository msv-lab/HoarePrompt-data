Output State: **`i` is equal to 0; `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to 0. The variable `sums` is assigned the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Since the values of `sum1`, `a`, and `x` are not specified, the expression for `sums` is left in its general form.
