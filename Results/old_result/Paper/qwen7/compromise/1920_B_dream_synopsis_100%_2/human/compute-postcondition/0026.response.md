Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`, `ans` depends on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, its value remains unchanged after this operation. The variables `i`, `k`, and the condition for `ans` remain unaffected. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `k` is still a non-negative integer, and `ans` now contains the calculated `sums` as its first element. The condition for `ans` still depends on whether `i + x - 1 < n`.
