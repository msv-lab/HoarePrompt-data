Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `sums` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only new information is that `ans` now contains the value of `sums` after the append operation.
