Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. Additionally, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 represents the elements of the array. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will be a list containing `k+1` elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be within the range [0, k], `sums` will be updated according to the conditions specified in the loop body for each value of `i` from 0 to `k`. Specifically, if `i == 0`, `sums` will initially be set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. For subsequent values of `i`, `sums` will be updated as follows: if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` will be updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` will be updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. The list `ans` will contain all the updated values of `sums` for each iteration of the loop. The variables `n`, `k`, and `x` will remain unchanged from their initial values, and `a` and `sum1` will also remain unchanged.

In summary, `ans` will be a list of length `k + 1` containing the sequence of `sums` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, starting with the initial value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and updating according to the specified conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will execute `k + 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be `k + 1`, `x` will remain an integer, and `n` will remain an integer. The variable `ans` will be a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` will be calculated based on the conditions within the loop:

- If `i == 0`, the first element in `ans` will be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent elements (when `i > 0`), the value of `sums` will be updated as follows:
  - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` will be updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` will be updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

Each updated value of `sums` will be appended to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain the sequence of `sums` values computed through each iteration of the loop.

In summary, `ans` will be a list of length `k + 1` with each element representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, starting from the initial computation when `i == 0` and updating according to the given conditions for subsequent iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
