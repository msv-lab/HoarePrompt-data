Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, `ans`, and `sums` are updated as described.
