Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `sums` is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` or `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` depending on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`. If the condition is true, `ans` is a list containing `[sums]`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums` if the condition is met, or it appends `sums` to itself.
