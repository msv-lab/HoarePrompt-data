Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` if the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `ans` is appended with the value of `sums`.**

This means that the value of `sums` is added to the list `ans`. The other variables retain their initial or unchanged states.
