Output State: **`i` is an integer and not equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and the inequality \(i + x - 1 \geq n\) holds; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`; `ans` contains the value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and the condition \(i + x - 1 \geq n\) remain unchanged. The value of `sums` remains as `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `ans` now includes the updated value of `sums`.
