Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `sums` is `a[0]`**

Explanation: The code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` attempts to add the element `a[i - 1]` to the variable `sums`. However, `sums` is not defined before this line, and there's no initial value given for it. Since `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` corresponds to `a[0]`. Thus, `sums` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
