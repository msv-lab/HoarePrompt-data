Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, k], `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` includes the updated value of `sums` if the conditions are met, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `sums` has been updated according to the given formula, while all other variables (`i`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
