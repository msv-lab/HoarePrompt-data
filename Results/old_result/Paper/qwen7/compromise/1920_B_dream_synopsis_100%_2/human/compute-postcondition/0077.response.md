Output State: **`sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`; `ans` contains the value of `sums` from the previous iteration appended as a new element.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is updated as `sums + a[i - 1]` in each iteration, the value of `sums` from the previous iteration is added to `ans`. Variables `sum1`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their previous states.
