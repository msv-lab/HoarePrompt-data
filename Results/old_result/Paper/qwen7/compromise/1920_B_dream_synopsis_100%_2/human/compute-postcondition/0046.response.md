Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run as many times as the user inputs an integer value.

2. **Determine the initial state after the previous iteration**:
   - `i` will be equal to `k` after all iterations.
   - `k` remains a non-negative integer.
   - `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop.
   - `ans` is a list containing `k+1` elements.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each input integer. Since the loop variable `_` is a placeholder (it does not affect the state directly), the key variables to consider are the ones that change inside the loop.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will increment by 1 with each iteration.
   - `k` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.
   - `sums` will be updated based on the loop body conditions.
   - `ans` will remain the same until the loop completes.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `k` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop.
- `ans` will still contain `k+1` elements.

Since the exact value of `i` and `sums` changes with each iteration, we need to express them in terms of their updated values.

**Step-by-step adjustment**:
1. `i` will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
2. `k` remains the same.
3. `sums` will be updated, but without knowing the exact updates, we can't specify the exact value, so we'll just note that it has been updated.
4. `ans` will still contain `k + 1` elements.

**Final state**:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements**
