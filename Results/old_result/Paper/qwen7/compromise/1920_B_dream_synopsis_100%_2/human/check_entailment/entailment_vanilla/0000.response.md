Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order.
   - This step is crucial because it allows us to consider the largest elements first when Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements by -1.

3. **Calculating Initial Sum**:
   - The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through possible values of `i` (from 0 to `k`).
   - It calculates the sum of the array after removing `i` elements and multiplying up to `x` elements by -1.
   - The variable `sums` keeps track of the current sum after each iteration.
   - The `ans` list stores these sums for each possible combination of removals and multiplications.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `i == 0`, it directly calculates the sum after removing no elements and multiplying `x` elements by -1.
   - For other values of `i`, it updates the sum by adding the removed element and subtracting twice the value of the element that gets multiplied by -1.
   - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, it simply adds the removed element without considering further multiplications.

6. **Finding Maximum Sum**:
   - Finally, the maximum value from the `ans` list is printed.

### Correctness Check

1. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - Sorting the array in descending order ensures that we consider the largest elements first, which is important for both Alice and Bob's strategies.

2. **Dynamic Calculation**:
   - The dynamic approach correctly considers all possible combinations of removals and multiplications within the constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The edge cases are handled appropriately, ensuring that the logic works for all scenarios.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The maximum sum is correctly identified and printed.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program should work as expected for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
