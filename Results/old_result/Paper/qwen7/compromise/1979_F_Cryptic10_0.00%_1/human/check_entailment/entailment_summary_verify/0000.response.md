### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the problem description using the function summary and the problem constraints.

#### Problem Description and Constraints:
- We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph with \( n \) vertices, where \( n \) vertices originally form a complete graph and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges are removed.
- We can make up to \( n \) queries of the form `? d`.
- Each query returns the vertex with the minimum degree at least \( d \) and the vertex it is not connected to.
- If no such vertex exists, it returns `0 0`.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_2(n)` constructs a path by iteratively querying for vertices with decreasing degrees.
- It starts from the highest degree and iterates down to 0.
- If a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found and is still in the remaining set, it adds the vertex to the path and removes it from the set.

#### Analysis:
1. **Query Strategy**:
   - The function `func_2` starts by querying for the highest degree vertex (`d = n-1`).
   - If no such vertex is found, it queries for the next highest degree vertex, and so on.
   - This ensures that the function always tries to add the vertex with the highest degree first, which is a common heuristic for constructing paths.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - Since the graph is a complete graph minus \( n-2 \) edges, the structure of the graph ensures that there will always be a path connecting all vertices.
   - The function `func_2` guarantees that it will eventually find a vertex to add to the path because the graph is connected and the degree information helps in identifying the next vertex to remove.

3. **Handling Disconnected Components**:
   - Even if the graph is split into disconnected components, the function will still find a path because it continues to query for vertices with higher degrees until it finds a valid vertex to add to the path.
   - The process ensures that the path will be formed by iteratively removing vertices and adding them to the path, ensuring that the path remains connected.

4. **Guaranteed Path**:
   - Given that the graph is a complete graph minus \( n-2 \) edges, the function `func_2` will always be able to find a Hamiltonian path within \( n \) queries because it ensures that the path is constructed by iteratively removing vertices and adding them to the path.

Based on the above reasoning, the function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path within \( n \) queries.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct and guarantees finding a Hamiltonian path within \( n \) queries for all valid inputs.
