Output State: **`d` is 0, `v` is 0, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(0)`, we continue the loop or iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there is no modification of variables and the `continue` statement does not change the values of `d`, `v`, or `u`, these variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
