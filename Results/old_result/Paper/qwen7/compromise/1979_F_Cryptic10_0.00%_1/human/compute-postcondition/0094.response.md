Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `d` is -1
   - `v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`
   - `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, there is no change in the values of `d`, `v`, and `u`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head specifies that `d` takes values from `n-1` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `d`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop starts with `d = -1`, the next value `d` should take is `n-1` (the first value in the range).
   - There is no change in the values of `v` and `u` unless `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, but since no such condition is mentioned here, we assume no change.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `d` will be `n-1`
   - `v` remains the same as the previous iteration (`v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` unless it was changed due to a break)
   - `u` remains the same as the previous iteration (`u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` unless it was changed due to a break)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`d` is \(n-1\), `v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`**
