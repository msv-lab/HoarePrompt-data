Output State: **`v` and `u` are values returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`, which is `n-1` based on the initial state. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u`. The values of `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states.
