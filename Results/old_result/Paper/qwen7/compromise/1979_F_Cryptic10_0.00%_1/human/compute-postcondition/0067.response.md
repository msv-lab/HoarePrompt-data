Postcondition: `d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains `v`, `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, nothing changes.
