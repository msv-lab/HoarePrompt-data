Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. The variables involved here are `d` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `d` and `n`**:
   - From the state before the loop, we know that `d` is initially 0.
   - We need to determine what `n` should be for the loop to start executing.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`. For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 because if `n` is 0, the range will not include any values and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `d` is initialized to 0 and will change within the loop, but its initial value does not affect whether the loop starts.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to start executing.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop starts. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`d` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
