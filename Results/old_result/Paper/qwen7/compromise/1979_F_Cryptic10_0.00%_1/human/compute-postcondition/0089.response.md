Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, and `path` contains the value `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, it remains unchanged. The values of `d`, `u`, and the condition for the loop continuation also remain unaffected.
