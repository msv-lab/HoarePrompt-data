Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`, and `path` now includes the value of `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`, and `u` is also the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`, appending `v` to `path` means `path` now contains `v`. The values of `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged from their initial states.
