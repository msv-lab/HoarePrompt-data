Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding 0, `d` is `n-2`**.

This means that the function `func_1(d)` has been called twice, and both times it returned the same value, which is assigned to `v` and `u`. The `path` list and `remaining_vertices` set remain unchanged, and `d` retains its original value of `n-2`.
