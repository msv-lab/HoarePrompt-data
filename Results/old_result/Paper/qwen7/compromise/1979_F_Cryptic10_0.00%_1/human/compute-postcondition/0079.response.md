Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is added to path, and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`**.

Explanation: The line `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since the value of `v` is 0, `path` now contains the value 0. The values of `d` and `u` remain unchanged from their initial states.
