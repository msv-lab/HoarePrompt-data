Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`**.

In this state, `d` remains unchanged at -1, `n` remains unchanged, and `v` and `u` are assigned the return values from the function `func_1(d)`. The exact values of `v` and `u` depend on what `func_1(d)` returns, but they are now defined as the results of that function call.
