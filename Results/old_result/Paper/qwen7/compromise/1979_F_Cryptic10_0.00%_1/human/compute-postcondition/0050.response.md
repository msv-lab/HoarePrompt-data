Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`, which is `-1`. This function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. The initial state of `v` being updated and appended to `path` is not directly relevant here since the question only asks about the immediate changes to the variables. After the function call, `v` and `u` take the values returned by `func_1(-1)`, and `v` is removed from the set `remaining_vertices`.
