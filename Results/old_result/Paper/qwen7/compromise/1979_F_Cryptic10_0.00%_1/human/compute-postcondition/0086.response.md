Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `d`, `v`, or `u`, their values remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of these variables but indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
