Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. However, since no loop or conditional block was specified in the initial state, we assume it is part of a loop or conditional structure. The values of `d`, `v`, `u`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
