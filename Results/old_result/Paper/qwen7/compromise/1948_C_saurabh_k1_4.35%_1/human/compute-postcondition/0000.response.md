Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically represents the iteration count. However, since it is a placeholder, we don't need to adjust its state directly.

2. **Determine the input for the loop**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. This means the state of the input itself needs to be considered.

3. **Initial state given**: The initial state is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even. Each test case consists of two strings of length `n`, where each character is either `<` or `>`.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, the input `int(input())` must provide a valid value for `t`. Since `t` is the number of test cases, it must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, ensuring that `t` is within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
