The function modifies a list `a` of non-negative integers by setting all elements from index `l` to index `r` to the value `r - l + 1`. It also records the operation performed on the list in the `ops` list. If `l` equals `r` and the value at index `l` is not zero, it sets the value at index `l` to zero and records the operation. If `a[l]` is already equal to `r - l + 1`, no changes are made. If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it updates the list and records the operation. The function continues to recursively process sublists until all elements from `l` to `r` are set to the correct value.
