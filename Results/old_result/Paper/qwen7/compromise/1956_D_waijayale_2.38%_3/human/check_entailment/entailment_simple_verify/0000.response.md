### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function recursively ensures that the segment `[l, r]` of the array `a` is filled with the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum while respecting the MEX constraint.
- If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and records the operation.
- Otherwise, it calls itself recursively for the segment `[l+1, r]` and checks if `a[l]` needs to be updated to `r - l + 1`. If it does, it updates the segment and records the operation.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- This function is a helper function for `func_2` and is responsible for finding the optimal segment to update.
- It calculates the sum of the current segment `[l, r]`.
- If the sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it updates the segment to `[r - l + 1]` and records the operation.
- Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the segment and recursively processes the segments before and after the maximum value.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
- It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the logic of the functions.
- The recursive approach ensures that the array is processed optimally to maximize the sum while respecting the MEX constraint.
- The function `func_1` ensures that the segment is updated to the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum.
- The `recursive_maximize_sum` function handles the logic of finding the optimal segment to update.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly maximize the sum of the array elements. The provided examples in the problem description also align with the expected behavior of the program.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements while respecting the MEX constraint. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: True**
