Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

        #State: Output State: `a` is a list where all elements from index `l` to index `r` are set to `r - l + 1`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `r`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(l, r)` as its last element.

If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, then all elements from index `l + 1` to index `r` are set to `r - (l + 1) + 1`, `l` is incremented by 2, `r` remains unchanged, and `ops` contains the tuple `(l + 1, r)` as its last element. If `a[l]` equals `r - l + 1`, then no changes are made to the list `a`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, and `ops` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies a list `a` of non-negative integers by setting all elements from index `l` to index `r` to the value `r - l + 1`. It also records the operation performed on the list in the `ops` list. If `l` equals `r` and the value at index `l` is not zero, it sets the value at index `l` to zero and records the operation. If `a[l]` is already equal to `r - l + 1`, no changes are made. If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it updates the list and records the operation. The function continues to recursively process sublists until all elements from `l` to `r` are set to the correct value.

    #The program returns the sum of all elements in list 'a', the length of list 'ops', and the contents of list 'ops' itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` and returns three values: the sum of all elements in `a`, the length of the list `ops` (which is generated during the execution), and the contents of `ops`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7. l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n. ops is a list that will store the sequence of operations performed.

        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)

Otherwise, `mx` remains the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` remains the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ops` includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`, and if `pos != r`, `pos` is incremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with the new position `pos + 1` and the end index `r`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters `l` and `r`, which define a subarray of the list `a`. It modifies the subarray to maximize the sum of its elements under certain conditions. If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements in the subarray to \(r - l + 1\) and records the operation in the list `ops`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray, updates `ops` with the operation, and recursively calls itself on the left and right subarrays excluding the position of the maximum element, unless the maximum element is at the boundary of the current subarray. The function does not return a value but modifies the list `a` and populates the list `ops` with the operations performed.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^7.

    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    #This is printed: s (the sum of all elements in the list a), m (the maximum value in the list a)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the elements in a, m is the maximum value in a, and the console prints the pairs (l+1, r+1) for each operation in ops.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of integers `a` of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 18`) and calls another function `func_2` to compute the sum `s` of the elements in `a`, the maximum value `m` in `a`, and a list `ops` of operations. It then prints the sum `s` and the maximum value `m`, followed by the indices `(l+1, r+1)` for each operation in `ops`. The function does not return any value.
