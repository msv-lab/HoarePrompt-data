Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is responsible for setting all elements in a given subarray to a specific value and recording the operation. It ensures that the subarray from `l` to `r` is set to `r - l + 1` and logs the operation. This is crucial for ensuring that the subarray's sum is maximized.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations. It correctly delegates the task of maximizing the sum to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function is designed to maximize the sum of a subarray. It checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\). If true, it sets all elements in the subarray to \(r - l + 1\). Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray, updates the array, and recursively processes the left and right subarrays. This ensures that the subarray is maximized in a way that respects the constraints and conditions specified in the problem.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the necessary outputs, and prints them according to the problem statement. It correctly handles the input and output format as required.

Given the detailed execution summaries and the structure of the functions, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array using the allowed operations. Each function performs its intended task, and the overall flow ensures that the solution meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
