Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(l, r)` which is unpacked from the variable `ops`. Therefore, the relevant variables here are `l`, `r`, and `ops`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ops`**: The initial state of `ops` is given as the number of operations performed by `func_2`. However, since we are focusing on the loop head, we need to consider what `ops` represents in terms of the loop's execution.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one element. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Initial Values of `l` and `r`**: Since the loop unpacks `(l, r)` from `ops`, initially, `l` and `r` will be set to the values of the first element in `ops`.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `ops` must contain at least one element.
- `l` and `r` will be set to the values of the first element in `ops`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`ops` must contain at least one element, `l` is the first element of `ops`, `r` is the second element of `ops`**.
