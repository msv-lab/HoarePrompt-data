Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum value in `a`, and `ops` is the number of operations performed by `func_2`.**

Explanation: The code `s, m, ops = func_2(a)` calls a function `func_2` with the list `a` as an argument. The function returns three values: `s`, which is the sum of the elements in `a`; `m`, which is the maximum value in `a`; and `ops`, which is the number of operations performed by the function. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged, and new variables `s`, `m`, and `ops` are introduced with their respective values.
