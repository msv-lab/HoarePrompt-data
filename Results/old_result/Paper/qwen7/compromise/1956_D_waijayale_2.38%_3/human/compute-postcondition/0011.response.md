Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that now includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` to the variable `mx`. The sum `s` and the list `a` remain unchanged, and the list `ops` includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`.
