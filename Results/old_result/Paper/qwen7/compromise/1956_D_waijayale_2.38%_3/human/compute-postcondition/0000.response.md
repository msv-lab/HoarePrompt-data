Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, and n is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on `a`. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18 is still valid, and now `n` is set to the input integer.
