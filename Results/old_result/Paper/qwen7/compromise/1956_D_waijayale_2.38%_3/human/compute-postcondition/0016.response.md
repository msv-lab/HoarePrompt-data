Postcondition: **`mx` remains the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` remains the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ops` includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`, and either `pos` is the index of the maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` adjusted by `l` (if `pos != l` and `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called), or `pos` remains unchanged (if `pos == l`).**
