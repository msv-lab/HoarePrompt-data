Output State: **`rep` is 0, `k` is a non-zero value, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tab`. This does not affect the values of `rep`, `k`, `i`, `n`, `k`, or `number`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
