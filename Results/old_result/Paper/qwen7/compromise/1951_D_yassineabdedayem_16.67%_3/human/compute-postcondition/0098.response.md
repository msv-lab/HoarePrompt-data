Output State: **`rep` is `rep + 1`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated to either `k - 2*Max` or `k - Min`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` or `min(n // (k + Min), k + Min)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / (k - Max)), k - Max)` or `max(int(n / (k + Min)), k + Min)`, `number` is updated to either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` is further updated to `n - Min * Max**.

Explanation: The variable `rep` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, `tab`) remain unchanged from their previous updates. The value of `n` is further updated to `n - Min * Max`.
