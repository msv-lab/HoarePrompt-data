Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `rep` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `i` is the second element in the list `tab`.
   - `tab` must have at least two elements.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`.
   - According to the initial state, `i` is the second element in the list `tab`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `tab` is a list with at least two elements, `i` will be the second element of this list.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that there is a space after the printed value, but it does not affect what is printed.

Therefore, the output will be the second element of the list `tab`.

Output: **the second element of the list tab**
