Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted based on the if-else condition, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the condition evaluated in the if-else block, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `Min * Max` from `n`. The values of `rep`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged. The updated value of `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
