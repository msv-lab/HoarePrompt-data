Postcondition: `rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is adjusted based on the if-else condition, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the condition evaluated in the if-else block.
