Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min`, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`, and `number` is added to the list `tab` as a string.**

Explanation: The variable `rep` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and the list `tab` remain unchanged from their initial state because the code only increments `rep`.
