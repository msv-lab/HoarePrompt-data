Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is the last element in the list `tab`
   - `n` is `n - Min * Max`
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `rep` is `rep + 1`
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`
   - `tab` now contains one additional element which is the string representation of `number`

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition involves `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `n >= k`.
   - We need to ensure that all conditions in the loop head are satisfied for the next iteration.

4. **Analyze each condition**:
   - `n != 0`: This means `n` should not be zero.
   - `k > 0`: This means `k` should be greater than 0.
   - `rep < 60`: This means `rep` should be less than 60.
   - `n >= k`: This means `n` should be greater than or equal to `k`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` is currently `n - Min * Max`. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is currently greater than 0.
   - `rep` is currently `rep + 1`, and since `rep` was initially greater than 0, it will still be less than 60.
   - `n >= k` must hold true for the next iteration.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure it remains greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` now contains one additional element which is the string representation of `number`**.
