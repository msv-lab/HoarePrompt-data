Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is decreased by either `Max` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `Min` (otherwise), `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The line `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. Since `rep` was initially 1, after executing this line, `rep` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations affecting these variables are performed. The conditions for `k` being decreased by `Max` or `Min` also remain the same.
