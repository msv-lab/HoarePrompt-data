Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is updated to the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is updated to the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input, `t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))` is calculated using the new value of `n` and `k`, `rep` is 0, `number` is non-zero or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list or a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `rep` the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
