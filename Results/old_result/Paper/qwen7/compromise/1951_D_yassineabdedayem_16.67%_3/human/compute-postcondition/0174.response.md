Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes three values: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 1 and 10^18), and k (a positive integer between 1 and 10^18). For each test case, it returns a specific output based on the relationship between n, k, and t.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here, only the parameters implied by the constraints and the nature of the function's expected behavior.
