Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `number` is non-zero, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `tab` is an empty list.

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the list `tab` will be completely exhausted since it starts with 60 elements and one element is printed out in each iteration. Therefore, after 60 iterations, `tab` will be an empty list. The variable `i` will be set to the last element of `tab` before the loop ends, which means it will hold the value of the last string in the original `tab`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `number`) remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
