Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // (max(int(n / k), k)), max(int(n / k), k))`, `Max` is `max(int(n / (max(int(n / k), k))), max(int(n / k), k))`, `number` is `min(n // (max(int(n / k), k)), max(int(n / k), k))`, `k` is `k - max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from it. Here, `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - max(int(n / k), k)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
