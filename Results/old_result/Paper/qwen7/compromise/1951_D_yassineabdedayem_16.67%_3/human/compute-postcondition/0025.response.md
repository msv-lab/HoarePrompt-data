Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is decreased by `min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is 1, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**.

In this output state, the value of `k` is updated to `k - min(n // k, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
