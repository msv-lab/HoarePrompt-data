Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is `k - Min`, `rep` is 0, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `k`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from it. Here, `Max` is defined as `k`, so `k` is effectively set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
