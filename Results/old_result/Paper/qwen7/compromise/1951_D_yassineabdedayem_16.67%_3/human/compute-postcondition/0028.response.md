Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, `k` is decreased by either `Max` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `Min` (otherwise), `rep` is 1, `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

To break down the changes:
- `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.
- `k` is decreased by either `Max` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `Min` (otherwise).
- All other variables (`rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation `n -= Min * Max`.
