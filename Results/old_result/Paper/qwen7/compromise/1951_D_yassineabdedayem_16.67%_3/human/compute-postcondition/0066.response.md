Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is equal to `Min`**.

Explanation: The variable `number` is assigned the value of `Min`, which is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
