In the given initial state, there is no variable named `tab` defined. The only variables mentioned are `rep` and `k`, where both are equal to 0. Since `tab` is not defined, attempting to execute `len(tab)` will raise a `NameError`.

Given this situation, the code snippet provided cannot be executed as written because `tab` is undefined. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what will be printed.

Output: **NameError: name 'tab' is not defined**
