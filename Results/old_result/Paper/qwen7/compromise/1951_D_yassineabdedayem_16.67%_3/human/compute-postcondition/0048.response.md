Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in tab`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the list `tab`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `number` is non-zero.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over `tab`, at the end of each iteration, `i` takes on the value of the next element in `tab`.
   - After 60 iterations (since `tab` contains 60 elements), `i` will have taken on all values in `tab`, and the loop will terminate.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the first element of `tab`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains 0 since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `rep` remains 60 since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `number` remains non-zero since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` should be set to the first element of `tab`.
   - `tab` should have one less element since the first element has been processed.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `number` is non-zero, `i` is the first element of `tab`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 59 times**.
