Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is reduced by `Min`, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `Min` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
