Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on whether `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` holds true, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the same condition.
