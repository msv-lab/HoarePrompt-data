Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `k` is 0 or `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `number` is non-zero or `max(int(n / k), k)`.
   - `tab` is an empty list or a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times.
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration.
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration.
   - `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, and `t` decreases by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is one less than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive (since it was between 1 and 1000 and decreased by 1).
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`, `rep` is 60, `number` is non-zero or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list or a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration.**
