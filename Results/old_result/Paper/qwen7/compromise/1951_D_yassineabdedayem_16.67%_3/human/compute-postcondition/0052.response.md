Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `number` is non-zero, `i` is the 59th element of `tab`, `tab` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to iterate as long as there are elements in the `tab` list. Initially, `tab` contains the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times. After each iteration, one element is removed from `tab`. Therefore, after 60 iterations, `tab` will be completely empty. Since `i` takes on the value of each element in `tab` during each iteration, by the last iteration, `i` will be the 59th element of `tab` that was printed. After the 60th iteration, `tab` will be empty.
