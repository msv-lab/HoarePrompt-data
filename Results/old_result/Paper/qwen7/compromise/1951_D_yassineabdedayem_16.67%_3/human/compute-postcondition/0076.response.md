Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted based on the if-else condition, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the condition evaluated in the if-else block, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The line `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. Initially, `rep` was 0, so now `rep` is 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged from their initial states.
