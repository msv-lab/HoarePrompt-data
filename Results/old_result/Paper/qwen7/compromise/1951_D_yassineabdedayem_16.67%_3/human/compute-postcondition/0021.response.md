Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`, `Min` is reassigned to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is reassigned to `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

The code updates the values of `Min` and `Max` by reassigning them to the results of the `min` and `max` functions applied to `n // k` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
