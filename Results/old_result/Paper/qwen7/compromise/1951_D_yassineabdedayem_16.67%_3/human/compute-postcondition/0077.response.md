Let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted:

1. **`n != 0`**: This condition checks if `n` is not zero.
2. **`k > 0`**: This condition checks if `k` is greater than zero.
3. **`rep < 60`**: This condition checks if `rep` is less than 60.
4. **`n >= k`**: This condition checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `rep` is 1
- `n` is `n - Min * Max`
- `k` is adjusted based on the if-else condition
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`
- `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the condition evaluated in the if-else block
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`

For the loop to execute one more time, all the conditions in the `while` loop must be true. Let's analyze each condition:

1. **`n != 0`**: Since `n` is `n - Min * Max`, for `n` to be non-zero, `n - Min * Max` should not be zero. This means `n` should not be equal to `Min * Max`.
2. **`k > 0`**: The value of `k` is adjusted based on the if-else condition, but it must remain positive.
3. **`rep < 60`**: Since `rep` is 1, this condition is trivially true as long as the loop continues.
4. **`n >= k`**: For `n` to be greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `n` after the subtraction (`n - Min * Max`) should still be greater than or equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that:
- `n` is not zero (i.e., `n` should not be equal to `Min * Max`).
- `k` remains positive.
- `n` is still greater than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `k`.

State: **`rep` is 1, `n` must not be equal to `Min * Max`, `k` must be positive, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
