Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Max` (which is `max(int(n / k), k)`) to the variable `number`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
