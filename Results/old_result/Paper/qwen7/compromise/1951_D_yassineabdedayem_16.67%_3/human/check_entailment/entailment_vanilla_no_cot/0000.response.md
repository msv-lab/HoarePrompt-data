Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the scenario where Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The logic in the `while` loop is flawed and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Price Calculation**: The code attempts to calculate the minimum and maximum possible prices (`Min` and `Max`) but does not correctly set these values based on the problem constraints.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Buying Jewels**: The logic for decrementing `n` and `k` is not aligned with the greedy buying behavior described in the problem statement.
3. **Stopping Condition**: The loop should stop when Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels or when no more stalls can be used, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting the prices of the stalls appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        prices = [0] * 60
        stalls = 0
        
        # Set up stalls with decreasing prices
        for i in range(1, min(k + 1, 60)):
            prices[stalls] = n // (k - (i - 1))
            n -= prices[stalls]
            stalls += 1
        
        # Check if we have exactly k jewels
        if sum(prices[:stalls]) == k:
            print('YES')
            print(stalls)
            print(' '.join(map(str, prices[:stalls])))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution sets up the stalls with decreasing prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It iterates up to the minimum of `k` and 60 stalls, setting the price for each stall and ensuring the total number of jewels bought equals `k`.
