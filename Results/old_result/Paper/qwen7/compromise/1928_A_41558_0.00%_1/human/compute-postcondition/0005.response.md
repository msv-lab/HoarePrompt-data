Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks if \(a\) and \(b\) meet certain conditions: both being odd, or one being exactly twice the other. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not modify the initial values of \(t\), \(n\), \(a\), or \(b\), and only outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.**
