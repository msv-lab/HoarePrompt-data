Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` checks if both dimensions are odd. If both dimensions are odd, the program prints 'NO'. However, this is not sufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. For example, a \(3 \times 5\) rectangle can be cut into \(3 \times 2\) and \(3 \times 3\), and then rearranged to form a \(6 \times 3\) rectangle.

2. **Equal Halves Check**: The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other. If this condition is met, the program prints 'NO'. This is also not correct. For instance, a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into \(2 \times 2\) and \(2 \times 2\), and rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle, which is the same as the original.

3. **General Case**: The program should consider more general cases where the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle. Specifically, if either dimension is even, it can always be divided into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different shape.

To fix the program, we need to check if at least one dimension is even, as this allows for the possibility of forming a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version checks if either dimension is even. If so, it prints 'YES' because a rectangle with an even dimension can always be cut and rearranged into a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO' because no such rearrangement is possible.
