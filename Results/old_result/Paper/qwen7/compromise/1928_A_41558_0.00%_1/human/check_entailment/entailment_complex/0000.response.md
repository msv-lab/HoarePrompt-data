Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions \(a \times b\) by cutting and rearranging the pieces.
- The annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if the given conditions are met:
  - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'NO'.
  - If one dimension is exactly twice the other, it also prints 'NO'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
- These conditions ensure that:
  - If both dimensions are odd, it's impossible to form another rectangle without rotating.
  - If one dimension is exactly twice the other, the only possible rearrangement results in the same dimensions.
- The program processes each test case independently and outputs the correct result for each case.
- The program does not modify the initial values of \(t\), \(n\), \(a\), or \(b\) after processing all test cases, and it only outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
