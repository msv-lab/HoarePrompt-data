Output State: **`count` is 4, `arr` is a non-empty list that does not contain its third element, `num` is the third element in the list, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is updated, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is now 2, `mod_x` is `-num % x` which is equivalent to `x - (num % x)` if `num % x` is not zero, otherwise it is 0.**

Explanation: The code `mod_y = num % y` calculates the modulus of `num` with respect to `y` and assigns it to `mod_y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
