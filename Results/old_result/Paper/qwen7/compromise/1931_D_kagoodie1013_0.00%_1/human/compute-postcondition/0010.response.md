Output State: **`count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % y` to `mod_y_key`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `mod_y_key`.
