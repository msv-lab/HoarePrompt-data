Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `count` is 1, `arr` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element in the list, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, and `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is 1.

3. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the first element in the list `arr`, after processing this element, `num` will be the second element in the list.
   - The list `arr` will now contain all elements except the first one (since the first element has been processed).
   - `count` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` remain the same since they depend on the current `num`, which changes but their values are derived from the original `num`.
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` remains 1 because it is a mapping that does not change based on the loop iteration.

4. **Construct the new state**:
   - `count` is now 2.
   - `arr` is a non-empty list, but it no longer contains the first element.
   - `num` is the second element in the list.
   - `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` remain the same.
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` remains 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`count` is 2, `arr` is a non-empty list that does not contain the first element, `num` is the second element in the list, `mod_x_key` is the same as before, `mod_y_key` is the same as before, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is 1**
