You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The values of n, x, and y satisfy 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x_map = {}
        
        mod_y_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = -num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `results` contains the cumulative sum of `count` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, `arr` is an empty list, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries containing the frequencies of all possible remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y` respectively across all iterations, and `count` is the final sum of all `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` values for the last iteration.
    return results
    #The program returns the cumulative sum of `count` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, stored in the list `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each tuple, it calculates a count value and stores the cumulative sum of these count values in a list called `results`. Finally, it returns the list `results`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the cumulative sum of `count` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, stored in the list `results`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
