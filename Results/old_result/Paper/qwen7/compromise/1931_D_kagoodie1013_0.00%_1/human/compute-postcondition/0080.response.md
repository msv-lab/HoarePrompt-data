Output State: **`count` is `num % y` + (-num % x) + 2, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % y` to `mod_y_key`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignment for `mod_y_key`.
