Output State: **`count` is `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2 + 1 + 3, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 3, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % y` to `mod_y_key`. Since `mod_y_key` was previously mapped to 3 in the `mod_y_map` dictionary, this assignment does not change the dictionary's content. The other variables (`count`, `arr`, `mod_y_map`, `results`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the same values for these variables as the initial state, with the addition of the new assignment for `mod_y_key`.
