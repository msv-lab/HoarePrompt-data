Output State: **`count` is `num % y` + 0, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % x` to the variable `mod_x_key`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
