Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it to form test cases. Each test case consists of an array and parameters \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program initializes a counter `count` to zero and creates two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to store the frequency of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \( x \) and \( y \) respectively.

3. **Iterating Through Array Elements**: For each element in the array, the program calculates the remainder when the element is divided by \( x \) and \( y \). It then updates the `count` by adding the frequencies of these remainders from the respective maps. After updating the counts, it also updates the frequency maps with the current element's remainder.

4. **Result Calculation**: The `count` is incremented based on the presence of matching remainders in both maps, which ensures that the conditions for a "beautiful pair" are met.

5. **Returning Results**: The program appends the final `count` value to the `results` list and returns this list at the end.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the algorithm to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The approach uses a hash map to efficiently count the occurrences of remainders, ensuring that the solution is optimal for large arrays.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
