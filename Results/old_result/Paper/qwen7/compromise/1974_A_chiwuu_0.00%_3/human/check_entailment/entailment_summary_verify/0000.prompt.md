You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, x, and y. For each test case, it calculates an integer t based on the values of x and y, ensuring t remains within the range of 1 to 10^4. It updates t according to specific conditions involving arithmetic operations and prints the final value of t for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating `t` and `t1` does not accurately reflect the constraints and requirements of the problem.

For instance, consider the following input:
- `x = 12` (number of 1x1 icons)
- `y = 4` (number of 2x2 icons)

According to the problem description, we need to fit these icons into 5x3 grids. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so 4 such icons will occupy 16 cells. Since each grid has 15 cells, we need at least 2 grids to fit all the icons. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed.

Let's break down the issues:
1. The calculation `t = b * 2` and subsequent division and subtraction steps do not correctly account for the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
2. The logic for determining the number of remaining cells (`t1`) and further calculations do not properly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

To verify this, let's manually check the example:
- We need to fit 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons.
- 4 2x2 icons occupy 16 cells, which requires 2 grids since each grid has 15 cells.
- After placing 4 2x2 icons, we have 12 - (4 * 4) = 4 cells left to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
- These 4 cells can be placed in one additional grid, making the total number of grids needed 2.

However, the program incorrectly calculates this and outputs 1 instead of 2.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
