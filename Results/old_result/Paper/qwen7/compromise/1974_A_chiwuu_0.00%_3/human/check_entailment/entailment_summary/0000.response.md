Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens**:
   - The program calculates `t` as `b * 2`, which represents the total number of 2x2 icons scaled up to 1x1 equivalent.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, it divides `t` by 5, otherwise, it performs integer division and adds 1. This step seems to be an attempt to calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - Then, it calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space to place all 1x1 icons, so it sets `t` to the current value.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the remaining number of 1x1 icons (`t2`) that need to be placed and adjusts `t` accordingly. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, it divides `t2` by 15, otherwise, it does integer division and adds 1.

3. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `t` for each test case.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The calculation of `t1` and subsequent adjustments do not accurately reflect the placement of 1x1 icons on the screens. Specifically, the formula `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` does not correctly account for the available space on the screens.
- The logic for adjusting `t` based on the remaining 1x1 icons is overly complex and does not correctly handle the placement constraints.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
