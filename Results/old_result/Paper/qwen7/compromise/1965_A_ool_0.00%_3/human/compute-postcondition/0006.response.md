Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `arr[0]` equals 1; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a set from the list `arr`, which removes duplicate elements, and then converts the set back into a list. Since `arr[0]` is guaranteed to be 1, and the set operation will remove any duplicates, `set_` will contain unique elements from `arr`. The length of `arr` and the range of its elements remain unchanged.
