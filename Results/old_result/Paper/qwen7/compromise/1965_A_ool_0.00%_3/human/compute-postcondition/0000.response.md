Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; A is False.**

Explanation: The code `A = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `A`. No changes are made to the list `arr`, so its state remains unchanged. The only change is that `A` is now `False`.
