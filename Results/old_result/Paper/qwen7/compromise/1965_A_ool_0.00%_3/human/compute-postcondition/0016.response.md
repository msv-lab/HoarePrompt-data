The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents the number of stones in each pile, and the length of the list is between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), with each integer in the list being between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (inclusive).

The function returns 'Alice' under two cases:
- Case_1: The function directly returns 'Alice'.
- Case_2: The function returns 'Alice' because the variable `not_c` is False, and 'A' is equivalent to 'not_c'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return 'Alice' in both specified cases.
