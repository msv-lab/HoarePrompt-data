Output State: **`not_c` is True, `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `arr[0]` equals 1; `set_` is a list containing sorted unique elements from `arr`.**

The variable `not_c` is set to `True`, which does not affect the values of `arr` or `set_`. The initial conditions for `arr` and `set_` remain unchanged.
