The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents the number of stones in each pile, and the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive. Each integer in the list satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

Based on the given cases, the function returns 'Alice' in both scenarios. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return 'Alice'.
