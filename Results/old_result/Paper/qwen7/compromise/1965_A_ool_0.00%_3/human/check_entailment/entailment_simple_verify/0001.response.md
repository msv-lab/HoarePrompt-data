### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, it immediately returns 'Alice' because Alice can always remove one stone from each pile, making the smallest pile size 1, and then Bob will be forced to remove one stone from each pile, eventually leading to Alice winning.
   - If the smallest pile has exactly one stone, it proceeds to check the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the sorted unique pile sizes and checks if the difference between any two consecutive sizes is greater than 1. If such a difference exists, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The boolean variable `A` toggles its value in each iteration of the loop.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

3. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the winning condition based on the differences between the sizes of the piles.
   - However, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The current implementation only checks if there is a gap of more than one between any two consecutive unique pile sizes. This is not sufficient to determine the winner in the game described.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The game described is a variation of the Nim game, where the winning strategy involves ensuring that the XOR of the pile sizes is non-zero for a winning position.
   - The current implementation does not correctly implement the Nim game strategy. Instead, it incorrectly assumes that the presence of a gap greater than one in the sorted unique pile sizes determines the winner.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the Nim game strategy correctly. For example, consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3
     1 3 1
     ```
     According to the Nim game strategy, the XOR of the pile sizes (1 ^ 3 ^ 1) is 3, which is non-zero, indicating that the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return 'Bob'.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy for the described game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
