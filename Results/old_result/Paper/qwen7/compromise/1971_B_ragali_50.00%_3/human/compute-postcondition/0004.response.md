Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. This means the loop variable `i` is iterating over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `i` is initially 0.
   - `s` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `a` is an empty set.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on the string `s`, we need to ensure that `s` contains at least one character. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `a`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `s` must contain at least one character.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string (must contain at least one character), `a` is an empty set**.
