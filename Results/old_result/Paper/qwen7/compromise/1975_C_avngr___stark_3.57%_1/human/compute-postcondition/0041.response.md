Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value between any two consecutive elements in the list `a`, and this maximum value is the largest minimum value found between any two consecutive elements during the entire execution of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while the other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, and `max`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
