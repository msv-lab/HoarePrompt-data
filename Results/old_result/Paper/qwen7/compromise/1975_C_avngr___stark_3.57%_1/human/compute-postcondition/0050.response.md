Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 499.
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `max` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 2 (since it was at least 2 at the start and no condition in the loop body has changed this).

4. **Construct the New State**:
   - `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` changes to 2.
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `a` and `max` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`**.
