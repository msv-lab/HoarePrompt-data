Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start with `i = 1` and continue until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust the Given States**:
   - The variable `t` is not relevant to the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `a` is not used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `max` is not used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` must be set to 1 for the loop to start its first iteration.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0**
