Output State: **`a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is undefined, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `hd = a1 - a2` updates the value of `hd` to be the difference between `a1` and `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
