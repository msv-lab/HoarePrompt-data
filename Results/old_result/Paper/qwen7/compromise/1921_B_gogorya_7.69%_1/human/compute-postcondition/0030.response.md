Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `hd` is `hd - 1`, `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i] is '0', continue statement is executed.**

The `continue` statement is encountered, which means the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the control moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, since no new assignments or changes to variables are made by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `i`, `hd`, and `res` remain as they were before the `continue` statement was executed. The condition for incrementing `res` (if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0') remains unchanged.
