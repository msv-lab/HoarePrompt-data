Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `hd` is either equal to `hd - 1` or remains unchanged.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.

4. **Determine the New State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 1.
   - `hd` can either be `hd - 1` or remain unchanged, but we don't have enough information to determine its exact new value without additional context.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if the condition `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` holds true. However, since we don't know the values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` from the previous iteration, we cannot determine the exact new value of `res`.

Given these points, we can only update the state of `i` and leave `hd` and `res` as they are unless we have specific information about their values.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `hd` must be either equal to `hd - 1` or remain unchanged, `res` must be incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'**.
