State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at all, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
4. No other variables or states need adjustment as they are not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
