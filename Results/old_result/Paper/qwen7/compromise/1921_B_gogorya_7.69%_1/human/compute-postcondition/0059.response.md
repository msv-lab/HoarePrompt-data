Output State: **`hd` is decreased by 3, `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `hd`, `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
