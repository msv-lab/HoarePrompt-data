Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - **Variable `i`**: According to the loop, `i` starts from `n-1` (since `i` is initially set to `n-1` outside the loop). For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(n)`, which means `i` should be between `0` and `n-1` inclusive.
   - **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n-1`, and the loop will execute if `i` is in the range `[0, n-1]`, we need to ensure that `i` is within this range.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` must be within the range `[0, n-1]`.
- `n` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer**
