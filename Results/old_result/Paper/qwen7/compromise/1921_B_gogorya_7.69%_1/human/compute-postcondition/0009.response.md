Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the parameter `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the `range` function).
   - `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

3. **Consider the Given States**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s1` is a string input by the user.
   - `s2` is a string input by the user.
   - `a1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s1`.
   - `a2` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s2`.
   - `hd` is `a1 - a2`.
   - `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure these variables are set correctly.
   - `i` should be 0.
   - `n` must be a positive integer.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 is not directly related to the loop execution but can be kept as is.
   - The strings `s1` and `s2` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The values of `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, and `res` are derived from `s1` and `s2` and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
