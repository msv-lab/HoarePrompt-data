Output State: **Postcondition: `hd` is decreased by the total count of occurrences where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` in the range of `n`, `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed (which is `n`), `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is the total count of occurrences where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` in the range of `n`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `hd` will be decreased by the total count of occurrences where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `t` remains 0 as it was never incremented. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed. The variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` at each iteration. The variable `res` will hold the total count of occurrences where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
