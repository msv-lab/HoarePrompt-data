Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `hd` is `hd - 1`, `s1` and `s2` are strings, and `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `hd` is decremented by 1, so `hd` becomes `hd - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `res`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
