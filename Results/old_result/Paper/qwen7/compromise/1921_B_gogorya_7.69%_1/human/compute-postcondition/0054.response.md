Output State: **`hd` is decreased by 2, `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `res` is 1, and the current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially not specified, it is assumed to be 0 before this line of code. After executing `res += 1`, `res` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
