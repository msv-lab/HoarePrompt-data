Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three digits and checks the conditions for a stair and a peak. The program outputs the correct string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case as per the problem requirements.
