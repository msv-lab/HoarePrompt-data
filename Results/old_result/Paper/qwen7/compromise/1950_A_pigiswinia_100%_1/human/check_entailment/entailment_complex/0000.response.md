Reasoning:
1. The problem description specifies that the input consists of an integer `t` followed by `t` sets of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. The function correctly reads the integer `t` and then processes each of the `t` test cases.
3. For each set of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the function checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. The function prints the appropriate string ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') based on these conditions.
5. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code that would cause it to produce incorrect results based on the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
