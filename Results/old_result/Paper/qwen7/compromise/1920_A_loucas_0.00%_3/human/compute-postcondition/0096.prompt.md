Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `iterable` is `prev_iterable + 1`; `iterable2` remains unchanged; `x` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `big` is an empty list; `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the corresponding iteration; `no` is an empty list; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is an input integer, `a` is either appended to the list `big` or added to either `less` or `no` list, `iterable2` is 0, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an input integer, `a` is either appended to the list `big` or added to either the `less` list or the `no` list, `iterable2` is 1, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an input integer, `a` is an integer derived from splitting the input and converting it to an integer. If `x` equals 1, `a` is appended to the list `big`. Otherwise, `a` is appended to either the `less` list or the `no` list. `iterable2` is 2, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
