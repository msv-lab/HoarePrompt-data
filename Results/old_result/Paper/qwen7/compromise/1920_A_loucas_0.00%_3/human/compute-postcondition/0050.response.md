Output State: **`i` is `max(big) + 1`; `num` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `num`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no other operations are performed on these variables, their values remain unchanged.
