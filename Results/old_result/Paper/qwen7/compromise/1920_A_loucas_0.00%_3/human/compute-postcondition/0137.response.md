Output State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a`, `x` is either equal to 1 or not equal to 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer**

Explanation: The code appends the input integer `a` to the list `big`. Since `big` was initially an empty list, after appending `a`, `big` now contains `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
