Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
        if i not in no:
            num = i
            break
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `x` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop, and `a` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop. The list `big` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the corresponding iteration, the list `less` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the corresponding iteration, and the list `no` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the corresponding iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All the values of `a` that were derived from splitting the input and converting it to an integer during the loop's iterations are distributed into three lists: `big`, `less`, and `no`. The variable `num` remains 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0. The variable `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `num` is still 0, `prev_iterable` remains equal to `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 3, and `x` is an integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
