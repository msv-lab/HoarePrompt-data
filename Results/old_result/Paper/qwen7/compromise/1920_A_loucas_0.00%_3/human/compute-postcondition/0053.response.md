Output State: **`i` is `max(big) + 2`, `num` is `i`, if `i` is not in `no`, we continue the loop**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `num`. Since `i` is defined as `max(big) + 2` and the condition `if i is not in no` is checked but not executed (because the code only assigns `i` to `num`), the original conditions remain valid. Therefore, `i` remains as `max(big) + 2`, and `num` is now equal to `i`. The loop continues if `i` is not in `no`.
