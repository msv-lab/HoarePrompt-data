Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `x` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop, and `a` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop. The list `big` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the corresponding iteration, the list `less` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the corresponding iteration, and the list `no` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the corresponding iteration.

This means that `big`, `less`, and `no` will collectively store all the input integers `a` received during the loop's iterations, categorized based on the value of `x` in each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `max(big) + 1`, and if `i` is not in `no`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `no`, no action is taken regarding the break statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `max(big) + 1`. If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `no`, no action is taken regarding the break statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `max(big) + 2`. If `i` is not in `no`, the loop continues and eventually breaks, but no changes are made to the variables outside the loop. If `i` is in `no`, the loop condition is not met, and the loop does not execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
