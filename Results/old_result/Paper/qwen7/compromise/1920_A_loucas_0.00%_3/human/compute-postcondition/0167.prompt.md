Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing all integers `a` where `x` was 3, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `num` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `prev_iterable` remains equal to `innerLoop`. The variable `iterable2` will be one less than `innerLoop` since it iterates from 0 to `innerLoop-1`. The lists `less`, `big`, and `no` will contain all the integers `a` that were input when `x` was 2, 1, and 3 respectively, based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, and if `i` (which is equal to `num` and `i`) is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` (which is equal to `num`) is `max(big) + 1`, and if `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 2`, and if `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
