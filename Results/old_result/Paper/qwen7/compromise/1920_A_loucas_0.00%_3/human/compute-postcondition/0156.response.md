Output State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is equal to `num`, `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the given code snippet, the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the loop or conditional statement.
