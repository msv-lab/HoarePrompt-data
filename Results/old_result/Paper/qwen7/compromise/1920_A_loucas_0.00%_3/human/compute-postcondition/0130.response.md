Output State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `x` is not equal to 2, `a` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `no`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
