Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for iterable in range(loop)`. The key variables here are `iterable` and `loop`.

2. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `num` remains 0.
   - `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`.
   - `innerLoop` is greater than 0.
   - `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `iterable` is less than `loop`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `iterable` was set to `innerLoop - 1` (since `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`).
   - For the next iteration, `iterable` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `innerLoop`.
   - Since `innerLoop` is greater than 0, the loop condition will still hold true.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `iterable` will be updated to `innerLoop`.
   - `prev_iterable` will remain the same since it is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `innerLoop` remains unchanged.
   - `iterable2` will be updated to `innerLoop - 1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`**.
