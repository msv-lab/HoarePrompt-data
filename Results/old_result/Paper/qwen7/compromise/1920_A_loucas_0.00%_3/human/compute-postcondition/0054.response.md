Output State: **`i` is `max(big) + 2`, `num` is `i`, if `i` is not in `no`, we continue the loop and we break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop immediately. Since the initial state includes the condition "if `i` is not in `no`, we continue the loop," the loop would only continue if `i` is not in `no`. However, the `break` statement overrides this condition and exits the loop regardless of whether `i` is in `no` or not. Therefore, the loop is broken, and the values of `i` and `num` remain unchanged.
