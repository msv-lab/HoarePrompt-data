You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. There are n lines describing the constraints, where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1, at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
            if i not in no:
                num = i
                break
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `iterable` will be equal to `loop`, `innerLoop` will be the value received as input for the last iteration of the outer loop, `x` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop, and `a` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop. The list `big` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the corresponding iteration, the list `less` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the corresponding iteration, and the list `no` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the corresponding iteration. The variable `num` will either be the smallest integer between the maximum of `big` and the minimum of `less` that is not in `no`, or it will remain 0 if no such integer exists.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `num` will hold the smallest integer within the specified range (between the maximum of `big` and the minimum of `less`) that does not appear in `no`, or it will remain 0 if no such integer is found.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of constraints through its execution. It returns a result based on the given constraints where each constraint is described by two integers (a, x) with specific conditions. The function ensures that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and all constraints are unique.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
