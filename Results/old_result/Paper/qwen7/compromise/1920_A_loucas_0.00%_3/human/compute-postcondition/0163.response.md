Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is set to `max(big) + 1`.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

4. **Check the loop termination condition**: The loop will terminate if `i` is in the list `no` or if the condition `max(big) < min(less)` is no longer true. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the start of the next iteration, we assume the loop continues unless explicitly stated otherwise.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to update `i` to `i + 1` and ensure that `max(big)` and `min(less)` remain the same as they are not being modified within the loop head.

Given these points, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 2`, and if `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
