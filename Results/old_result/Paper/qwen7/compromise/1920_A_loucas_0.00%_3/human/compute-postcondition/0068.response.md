Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `a` is appended to `big`, `iterable2` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, and the current value of `x` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. The values of other variables (`x`, `iterable2`, `innerLoop`) remain unchanged. The initial value of `x` is 1, which remains the same after the code execution.
