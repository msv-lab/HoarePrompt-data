Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is '0b11', `p` is 3, `q` is 2, `q` is updated to 2 ** (3 - 1) which equals 2**.

In natural language: `i` remains 1, `n` and `m` remain as input integers, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is '0b11', `p` is 3, `q` is initially 2 but is updated to 2 ** (3 - 1), which is 2.
