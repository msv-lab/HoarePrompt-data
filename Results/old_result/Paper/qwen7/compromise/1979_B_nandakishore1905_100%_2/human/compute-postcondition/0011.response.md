Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is even; `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix. Since `k` is an even number that is not a power of 2, its binary representation will start with '10' or more '0's following '10'. The variable `l` will store this binary string without the '0b' prefix. All other variables remain unchanged.
