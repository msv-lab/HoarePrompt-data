Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is '0b11', `p` is 3, `q` is 2, `f` is `k - 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `f` is assigned the value of `k - q`. Since `q` is 2, `f` becomes `k - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
