Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is '0b11', `p` is 1, and `q` is 2.**

Explanation: The code converts the integer `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) into its binary representation using the `bin()` function. The `bin()` function returns a string prefixed with '0b', so the string '0b11' is assigned to `l`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `p`, and `q`) remain unchanged.
