Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the number of test cases. The program assumes that there will always be 10 pairs of integers (as indicated by the loop `for i in range(10)`), but according to the problem statement, the number of test cases `t` is provided first, and then `t` pairs of integers follow. 

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This version correctly reads the number of test cases `t` first, and then processes each test case individually, which matches the problem description.
