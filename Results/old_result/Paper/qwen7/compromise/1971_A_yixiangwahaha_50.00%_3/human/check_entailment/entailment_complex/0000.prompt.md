Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list with 10 integers, `y` is a list with 10 integers.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 10 lines, each containing two integers separated by a space. For each iteration `i` from 0 to 9, if the value at index `i` in list `x` is less than the value at the same index in list `y`, it will print the value from `x` followed by the value from `y`. Otherwise, it will print the value from `y` followed by the value from `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` from the input. It then compares the corresponding elements of `x` and `y` and prints 10 lines, each containing two integers. If the element in `x` is less than the corresponding element in `y`, it prints the element from `x` followed by the element from `y`. Otherwise, it prints the element from `y` followed by the element from `x`. The function does not return any value.
