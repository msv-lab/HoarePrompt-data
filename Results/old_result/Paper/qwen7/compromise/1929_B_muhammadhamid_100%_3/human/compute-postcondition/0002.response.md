Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the conditions within the loop. For each test case, if \( k = 1 \), it will print 1. If \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), it will print \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). Otherwise, it will print \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

For example, if there are multiple test cases with different values of \( n \) and \( k \), the output will be a sequence of numbers corresponding to the above conditions for each test case.
