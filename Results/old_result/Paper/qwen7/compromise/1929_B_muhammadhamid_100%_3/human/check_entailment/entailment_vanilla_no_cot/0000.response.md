Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all test cases, particularly those where `k` is greater than `2 * (n + (n - 2))`. Let's analyze why this is incorrect and provide the correct solution.

#### Analysis:
- For an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
- If \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), the solution calculates the number of cells needed using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- However, when \( k > 2(n + (n - 2)) \), the solution incorrectly prints `k // 2 + 1`.

#### Correct Solution:
To find the minimum number of cells needed to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to consider the structure of the diagonals in the grid.

1. **Diagonals Structure**:
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
   - Each diagonal can be uniquely identified by its starting position.

2. **Minimum Coloring Strategy**:
   - To cover the maximum number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells, we can color cells such that each row and column contributes to covering different diagonals.

3. **Calculation**:
   - For \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) works.
   - For \( k > 2(n + (n - 2)) \), we need to cover more diagonals, and the correct approach is to use a combination of rows and columns.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of cells needed
            min_cells = n
            remaining_diagonals = k - 2 * (n + (n - 2))
            min_cells += math.ceil(remaining_diagonals / 2)
            print(min_cells)

func()
```

This solution ensures that the minimum number of cells required to cover at least \( k \) diagonals is calculated correctly for all values of \( k \).
