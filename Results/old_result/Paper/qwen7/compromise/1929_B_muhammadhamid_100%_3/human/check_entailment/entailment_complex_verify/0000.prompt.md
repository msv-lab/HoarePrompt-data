You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the conditions within the loop. For each test case, if \( k = 1 \), it will print 1. If \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), it will print \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). Otherwise, it will print \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
    #
    #For example, if there are multiple test cases with different values of \( n \) and \( k \), the output will be a sequence of numbers corresponding to the above conditions for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints a number based on specific conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k = 1 \), it prints 1. If \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). The function does not return any value but outputs a series of numbers corresponding to these conditions for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is greater than `4n - 2`, which is the maximum number of diagonals in an `n x n` grid. According to the problem description, the value of `k` should not exceed `4n - 2`. However, the program does not check this condition and proceeds to calculate the number of cells to color based on an invalid value of `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 20
```
Here, `n = 5` and `k = 20`. Since `4n - 2 = 18`, `k` should not exceed 18. However, the program will still attempt to compute the result, leading to an incorrect output. The correct output should be 5, but the program will incorrectly compute a value based on `k // 2 + 1`, which is not valid in this context.

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure that `k` does not exceed `4n - 2`.
