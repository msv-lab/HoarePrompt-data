Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length, for every index `j` from 0 to `n-2`, `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]`, and `l` is 'YES'.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The conditions inside the loop ensure that `l` remains 'YES' as long as there is at least one index where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not equal to `c[i]`. Since the loop continues until it finds an index where either `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]`, and given the problem statement, such an index does not exist (as the conditions hold for the first three iterations and no change is mentioned), `l` will remain 'YES' after all iterations.
