Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes variables t, n, a, b, and c, where t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive, and a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

This means the function likely iterates over multiple test cases defined by the variables t, n, a, b, and c, but since no specific return value is mentioned, it implies the function might be performing some operations or validations without returning a result.
