Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length `n`, `b` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string of length `n`, `l` is 'YES'**.

This output state reflects that the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was assigned the value of `int(input())`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` also remain unchanged as they were initially described. The variable `l` is explicitly set to 'YES'.
