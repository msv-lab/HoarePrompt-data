Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the final input string, `b` is the final input string, `c` is the final input string, `l` is 'YES'.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and increments `i` each time). The variable `l` will be 'YES' if for every index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If there exists any index where both conditions are false (`a[i] == c[i]` and `b[i] == c[i]`), then `l` remains 'NO'. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
