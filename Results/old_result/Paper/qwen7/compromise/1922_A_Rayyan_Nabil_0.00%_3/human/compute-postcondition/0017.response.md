Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length
   - The first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`
   - The first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`
   - `l` is 'YES'

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will increment from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 (since it starts from 0).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

5. **Condition for the Loop to Continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is now 2, the condition `i < n` will still hold true if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

6. **States to Adjust:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - The value of `i` will change from 1 to 2.
   - The other variables (`n`, `a`, `c`, `b`, and `l`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are specified, they stay the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length, the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`, the first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and `l` is 'YES'**
