Reasoning:
The provided function `func()` attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. It checks if for every index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If this condition holds for all positions, it sets `l` to 'YES'; otherwise, it sets `l` to 'NO'. Finally, it prints `l` for each test case.

However, the logic in the function is flawed. The function should check if there exists a template such that both `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not. The current implementation incorrectly sets `l` to 'YES' if the condition holds for all positions, which is the opposite of what the problem requires.

To fix this, the function should set `l` to 'NO' initially and change it to 'YES' only if it finds a position where both `a[i]` is equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        l = 'NO'
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
                break
        
        print(l)
```

With this correction, the function correctly checks if there exists a template such that both `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.

Correctness: **False**
