You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the final input string after all iterations, `b` is the final input string after all iterations, `c` is the final input string after all iterations, `l` is 'YES'.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and increments `i` each time). The variable `l` will be 'YES' if for every index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If there exists any index where both conditions are false (`a[i] == c[i]` and `b[i] == c[i]`), then `l` remains 'NO'. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold their respective final values after all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a series of strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For each test case, it checks if for every position `i` in the strings, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If this condition holds for all positions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes the variable `l` to `'YES'`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It iterates through each test case using a loop that runs `t` times.

3. **Reading String Length and Strings**: For each test case, it correctly reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Template Validation Logic**:
   - The current implementation checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for every position `i` in the strings.
   - If this condition holds true for any position, it sets `l` to `'YES'`.
   - If the condition fails for any position, it immediately sets `l` to `'NO'` and exits the inner loop.

5. **Output**: After processing all positions in the strings, it prints the value of `l`.

However, the logic has a flaw:
- The condition `if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is not sufficient to determine if there exists a valid template. This condition only checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. It does not ensure that `a` and `b` match some template while `c` does not.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = "a", b = "b", c = "c"`
  - `a[0] == 'a'` and `c[0] == 'c'`, so `a[0] != c[0]`.
  - `b[0] == 'b'` and `c[0] == 'c'`, so `b[0] != c[0]`.
  - The condition holds, but we need to check if `a` and `b` can match a template and `c` cannot. In this case, the template `"C"` works, so the output should be `"YES"`.

- **Test Case 3**: `a = "mathforces", b = "luckforces", c = "adhoccoder"`
  - We need to find a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
  - A possible template could be `"MATHFORCES"`. Here, `a` and `b` match, but `c` does not.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if a and b can match a template and c cannot
        valid_template = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i].islower() and c[i].islower() and a[i] == c[i]:
                valid_template = False
                break
            if b[i].isupper() and c[i].isupper() and b[i] == c[i]:
                valid_template = False
                break
        
        if valid_template:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not properly validate the conditions for the existence of a template. The corrected program ensures that the conditions for the existence of a valid template are met.
