### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). If no such pair exists, the output should be \((-1, -1)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it reads the array and the number of queries.
   - It then processes each query using a precomputed list `arr` which contains information about segments of consecutive identical numbers.
   - The `bisect_left` function is used to find the appropriate segment in `arr` for each query.
   - Based on the position of the segment relative to the query range \([l, r]\), the code determines whether to output a valid pair of indices or \((-1, -1)\).

3. **Key Points**:
   - The `arr` list is constructed to store the start and end indices of segments of consecutive identical numbers.
   - The logic for determining the output is sound and correctly handles the boundary conditions for the segments and the query ranges.
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient searching for the relevant segment.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like when the segment starts exactly at \(l\) or ends before \(r\).
   - It also handles the case where the entire range \([l, r]\) consists of the same number, resulting in no valid pair.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, providing valid pairs or \((-1, -1)\) for each query.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. It efficiently processes each query using precomputed segment information and handles all necessary edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
