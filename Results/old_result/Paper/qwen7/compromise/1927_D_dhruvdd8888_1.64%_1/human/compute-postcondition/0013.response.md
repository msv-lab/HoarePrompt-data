Based on the initial state provided:

- `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. This means `LA` is the length of the list `arr` minus one.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
- `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with an additional element `-1` appended.
- `s` is an integer representing the start index of segments.
- `e` is an integer representing the end index of segments.
- `num` is the last processed number from `nums`.
- `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: (1 + s, i, num), indicating the start index (adjusted by 1), the current index `i`, and the value `num` that triggered the segment change.
- `ppp` is equal to 23.

The `print(nums)` statement will print the list `nums`.

Given the description of `nums`, it is a list of integers obtained by splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, with an additional `-1` appended at the end. Since the exact input string is not provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `nums` other than knowing it includes integers from the split string plus the `-1`.

Therefore, the output will be the list `nums` which is derived from the input string with an additional `-1` appended.

Output: **[-1, ...] (where the list contains integers derived from the input string with an additional -1 appended)**
