Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `N` must be greater than 0
- If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` remains 1 and `i` remains 2, otherwise `t` remains 0, `i` is 2, and `N` must still be greater than 0.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of the variable `i`.

Output: **2**
