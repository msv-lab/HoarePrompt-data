Output State: **All values in the dictionary `cnt` will be incremented by the frequency of each element in the list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each element present in the list `a`. Since the loop iterates over the list `a` exactly `N` times (where `N` is the length of the list `a`), each element in `a` will increment its corresponding value in `cnt` by 1. Thus, the final state of `cnt` will reflect the frequency of each unique element in the list `a`.
