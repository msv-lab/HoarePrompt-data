Output State: **`cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `cnt` or `a[i]`, the only change is that the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` is incremented by 1.
