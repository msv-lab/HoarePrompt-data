Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with a default factory function that returns 0. This means that `cnt` is now a dictionary-like object where any key that does not exist will automatically be assigned a value of 0. The values of `tc`, `N`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
