Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `N-1`, and `t` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement is exiting, the only thing that happens is that the execution of the current block is stopped. The values of `i` and `t` remain as they were in the initial state, with `i` being `N-1` and `t` remaining unchanged because the condition to increment `t` was not met (since the `break` statement does not modify `t`).
