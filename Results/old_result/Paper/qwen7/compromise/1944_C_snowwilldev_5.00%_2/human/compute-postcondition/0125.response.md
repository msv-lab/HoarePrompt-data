Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `n`, a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, and an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, it returns information about the list `a` and the integer `t` based on the given constraints.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
