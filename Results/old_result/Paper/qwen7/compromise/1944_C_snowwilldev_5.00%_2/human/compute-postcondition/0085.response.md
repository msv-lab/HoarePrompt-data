Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `N` is the input integer, `tc` is `N` - 1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value int.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with a default value of `int`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `N`, `tc`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The `cnt` dictionary is created but remains empty initially.
