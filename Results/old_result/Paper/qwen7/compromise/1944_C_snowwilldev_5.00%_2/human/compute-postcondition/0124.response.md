Output State: `t` is 1, `i` is equal to `N`, and `N` is greater than 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `N` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `N-1` and then continues until the loop condition is no longer satisfied. Given that the loop has completed all its iterations without breaking early due to `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, `t` remains 1 (as it was incremented once when `cnt[2]` was 1, assuming `cnt[2]` was the last element checked before the loop condition was met). The value of `N` remains greater than 0 as it was initially and has not been modified by the loop.
