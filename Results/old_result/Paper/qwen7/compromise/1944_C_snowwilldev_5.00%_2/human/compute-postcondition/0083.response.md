Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `N` is the input integer, `tc` is `N` - 1**.

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `N`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the value of `tc` is updated to be one less than the new value of `N`.
