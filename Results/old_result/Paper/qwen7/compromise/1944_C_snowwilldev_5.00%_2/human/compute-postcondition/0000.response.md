Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `tc`, which is used to iterate over the number of test cases.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `tc`**: Since the loop is iterating over the number of test cases, `tc` should start from 0 and increment until it reaches the total number of test cases.

3. **Determine the Input**: The number of test cases is determined by the input, which is read using `int(input())`.

Given these points, let's formulate the required state adjustments:

- **Initial Value of `tc`**: Before the loop starts, `tc` should be set to 0 because the loop will start with the first test case.
- **Input Value**: The value of `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), indicating the number of test cases.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: `tc` is 0, and the input value must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed as intended, starting with the first test case and iterating through all the test cases.
