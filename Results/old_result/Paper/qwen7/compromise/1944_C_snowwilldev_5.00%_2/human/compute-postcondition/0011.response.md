Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `N-1`, and `cnt[a[i]]` (which is `cnt[a[N-1]]`) will be incremented by 1 for the last iteration. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each integer present in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will hold the value `N-1`, indicating it has iterated through all elements of the list `a`. The `cnt` dictionary will store how many times each integer in the list `a` appears.
