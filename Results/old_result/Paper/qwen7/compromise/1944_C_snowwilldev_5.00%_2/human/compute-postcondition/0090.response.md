Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - `t` is 1 (not part of the loop head).
   - `i` is 4.
   - `N` must be greater than 3.
   - `tc` is `N` - 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers (not directly involved in the loop head).
   - `cnt[a[2]]` is 2 (not directly involved in the loop head).

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `N`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - For the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than 3.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `N`.

**State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 5, `N` must be greater than 3, `tc` is `N` - 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt[a[2]]` is 2**
