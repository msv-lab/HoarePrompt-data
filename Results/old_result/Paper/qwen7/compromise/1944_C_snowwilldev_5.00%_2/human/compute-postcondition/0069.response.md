Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `N` must be greater than 0, and if `cnt[i]` equals 1, otherwise `t`, `i`, and `N` retain their original values of 0, 1, and greater than 0, respectively.

Since the value of `i` is explicitly stated as 1 and there is no mention of the `cnt` list or any conditions that would change the value of `i`, we can conclude that `i` remains 1.

Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
