Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Here's why:

1. **Game Rules Not Followed**: 
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it.
   - The solution does not simulate these rules; instead, it just counts occurrences of each number in `a`.

2. **Objective Misunderstanding**:
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after the game ends, considering optimal play from both players.
   - The current implementation does not account for the alternating turns and strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The provided solution prints values based on the count of numbers in `a`, which does not reflect the game's outcome where both players make optimal moves.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game considering the optimal strategies for both players. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's Moves**:
   - Alice will always try to add unique elements to `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to remove elements that could potentially increase the MEX.

2. **Track Elements**:
   - Use sets to track the elements picked by Alice and Bob.
   - Determine the optimal MEX based on the remaining elements.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def find_mex(a):
    mex = 0
    seen = set()
    for num in a:
        if num <= mex:
            seen.add(num)
        else:
            break
        mex += 1
    return mex

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice's turn
        alice_picks = set()
        bob_picks = set()
        
        i = 0
        while i < N:
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                if a[i] not in alice_picks and a[i] not in bob_picks:
                    alice_picks.add(a[i])
                else:
                    bob_picks.add(a[i])
            else:  # Bob's turn
                if a[i] not in bob_picks:
                    bob_picks.add(a[i])
            i += 1
        
        # Combine picks to form c
        c = alice_picks.union(bob_picks)
        
        # Find MEX of c
        print(find_mex(c))

# Example usage
func()
```

This code simulates the game according to the rules and finds the optimal MEX value.
