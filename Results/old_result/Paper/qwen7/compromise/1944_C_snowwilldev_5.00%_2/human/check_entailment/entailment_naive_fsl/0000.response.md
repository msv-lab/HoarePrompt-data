Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and calculate the MEX of the array `c` as described. According to the problem description, Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`, and Alice appends her chosen element to `c` while deleting it from `a`. Bob only deletes his chosen element from `a`.

However, the program does not simulate the game turns correctly. Specifically, it does not account for Alice appending elements to `c` and deleting them from `a`. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each element in `a` and prints the first index `i` for which `cnt[i] == 1` or `t >= 2`. This does not reflect the game's rules and the MEX calculation.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The correct output should be:
```
2
1
0
```

But the provided program will produce incorrect outputs because it does not simulate the game properly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
