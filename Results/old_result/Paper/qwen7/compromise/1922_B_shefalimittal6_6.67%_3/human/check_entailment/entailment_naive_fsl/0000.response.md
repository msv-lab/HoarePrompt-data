Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 2 2
```

The program will output `4`, but the correct output should be `4` as well, because any combination of three sticks of length 4 (since \(2^2 = 4\)) can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, the program does not handle the case where multiple sticks have the same length correctly. It only counts combinations without considering the triangle inequality.

To fix this, the program needs to check the triangle inequality condition for each combination of three sticks. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                for k in range(j + 1, n):
                    if nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k] and nums[i] + nums[k] > nums[j] and nums[j] + nums[k] > nums[i]:
                        res += 1
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected version explicitly checks the triangle inequality condition for each combination of three sticks, ensuring that only valid triangles are counted.
