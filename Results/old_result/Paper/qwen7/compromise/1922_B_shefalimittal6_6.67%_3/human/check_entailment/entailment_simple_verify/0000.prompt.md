You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

        print(res)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique value in all `nums` lists processed during the loop. The variable `res` is the cumulative result of adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` (frequency) that is 3 or more, and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` (frequency) that is 2 or more, where `total_sum` is the sum of all frequencies in `num_of_lens.values()` except for the current `cnt`. The variable `t` is set to 0 or negative, `n` retains its last input value, and `nums` is an empty list. The loop processes all values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to their conditions across all iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `res` will be the sum of all combinations calculated based on the frequencies of numbers in all `nums` lists processed, specifically:
    #- For every frequency of 3 or more, add the combination of choosing 3 out of that frequency.
    #- For every frequency of 2 or more, add twice the product of the combination of choosing 2 out of that frequency and the sum of all other frequencies.
    #
    #All other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`) remain unchanged and retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 2 2
```

The program will output `4`, but the correct output should be `4` as well, because any combination of three sticks of length 4 (since \(2^2 = 4\)) can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, the program does not handle the case where multiple sticks have the same length correctly. It only counts combinations without considering the triangle inequality.

To fix this, the program needs to check the triangle inequality condition for each combination of three sticks. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                for k in range(j + 1, n):
                    if nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k] and nums[i] + nums[k] > nums[j] and nums[j] + nums[k] > nums[i]:
                        res += 1
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected version explicitly checks the triangle inequality condition for each combination of three sticks, ensuring that only valid triangles are counted.
