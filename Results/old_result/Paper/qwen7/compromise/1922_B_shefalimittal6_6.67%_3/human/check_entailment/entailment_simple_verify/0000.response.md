### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.

#### Initial Assessment:
The original assessment states that the provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle because it does not account for the triangle inequality theorem. This is true, but let's verify the annotated code and the logic used in the program.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks.
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the frequency of each stick length.

2. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the values in `num_of_lens` to calculate combinations.
   - For each frequency `cnt` that is 3 or more, it adds `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to `res`.
   - For each frequency `cnt` that is 2 or more, it calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all other frequencies and adds `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to `res`.

3. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   - The annotated code does not explicitly mention checking the triangle inequality condition for each combination of three sticks.
   - The logic in the annotated code seems to focus on counting combinations based on the frequency of stick lengths rather than verifying the triangle inequality.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The annotated code does not include any logic to check the triangle inequality condition.
- The original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program does not account for the triangle inequality theorem.

Given that the program does not implement the necessary checks to ensure that the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle, the original assessment is accurate.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not check the triangle inequality condition for each combination of three sticks. Therefore, the final evaluation is that the program is incorrect.
