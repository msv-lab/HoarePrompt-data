Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` has a value equal to the number of occurrences of that key in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, still being greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it was an input integer. The dictionary `num_of_lens` now contains the count of each unique integer from the list `nums`. Finally, the list `nums` will contain at least 3 elements, as the loop iterated at least 3 times.
