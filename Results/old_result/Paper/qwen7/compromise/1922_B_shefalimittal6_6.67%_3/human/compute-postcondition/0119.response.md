Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` that satisfies `cnt >= 3`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `cnt >= 3`, then `res` is updated to include an additional term `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If the condition `cnt >= 3` is not met, the values of `num_of_lens`, `res`, `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
