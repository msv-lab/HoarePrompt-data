Output State: **`num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, and the value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except those that are equal to `cnt`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `res`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
