Based on the initial state provided, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key represents an element from `nums` and the corresponding value represents the count of that element in `nums`. The variable `res` contains the sum of combinations calculated based on these counts.

Let's break down the process:

1. For each key-value pair in `num_of_lens`, the loop calculates the combination of the count of that element.
2. The combination of a count `n` is given by the formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
3. The loop sums up all these combinations to get the final value of `res`.

Therefore, `res` is the sum of all combinations calculated from the counts of elements in `nums`.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of combinations calculated based on the counts of each element in nums)**
