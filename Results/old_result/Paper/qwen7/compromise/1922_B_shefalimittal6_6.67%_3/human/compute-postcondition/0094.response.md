Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 3, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, and `x` is the next element in `nums`.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. Since `x` was previously in the dictionary with a value of 2, it is now updated to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
