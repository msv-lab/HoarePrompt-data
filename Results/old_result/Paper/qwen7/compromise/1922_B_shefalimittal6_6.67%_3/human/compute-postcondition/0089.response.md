Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in nums:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `x` is the variable that will take the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `nums` is initially an empty list, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `num_of_lens`, `res`, `t`, and `n` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `nums` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**.
