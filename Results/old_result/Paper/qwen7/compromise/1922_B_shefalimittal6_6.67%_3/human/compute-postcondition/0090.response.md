Output State: **`num_of_lens` is now a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 1, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the count of the key `x` by 1. Since `x` was not previously in the dictionary, `num_of_lens.get(x, 0)` returns 0, and then 1 is added to it, making the value of `num_of_lens[x]` equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
