Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list `nums` of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates and sums specific combinations based on the frequency of each unique number in `nums`. Specifically, it adds the combination of choosing 3 out of the frequency for each number that appears 3 or more times, and twice the product of the combination of choosing 2 out of the frequency and the sum of all other frequencies for each number that appears 2 or more times. The function outputs the cumulative result for each test case.**
