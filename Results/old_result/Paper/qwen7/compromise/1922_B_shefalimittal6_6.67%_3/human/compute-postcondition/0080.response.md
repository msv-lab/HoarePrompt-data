Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `cnt` is updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` remains the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the current value of `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum`. The value of `cnt` is updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. The value of `total_sum` remains the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the current value of `cnt`, as no operation changes its value.
