Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`; `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`**.

This means that the value of `res` has been updated by adding the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
