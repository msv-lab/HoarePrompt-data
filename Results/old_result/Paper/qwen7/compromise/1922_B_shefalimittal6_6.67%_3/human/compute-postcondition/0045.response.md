Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. This results in a list of integers stored in the variable `nums`. The other variables (`num_of_lens` and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
