Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`. The variable `x` takes on the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value 2.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `x` is the second element of `nums`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `x` is the second element of `nums`, the next element in `nums` (if it exists) will be the third element.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least three elements, and `x` will be set to the third element of `nums`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `res` remains 0 as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nums` must now have at least three elements, and `x` will be the third element of `nums`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value 2, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `nums`**
