Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `x`: This variable will take on the value of each element in the list `nums`.
   
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `nums`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `x` should be set to the first element of `nums`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `x` will take the value of the first element in `nums`, we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty (otherwise, the loop won't execute).
   - We don't need to adjust the states of `num_of_lens`, `res`, or `n` because they are not used in the loop head.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `nums` must contain at least one element.
- `x` must be the first element of `nums`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `nums`**.
