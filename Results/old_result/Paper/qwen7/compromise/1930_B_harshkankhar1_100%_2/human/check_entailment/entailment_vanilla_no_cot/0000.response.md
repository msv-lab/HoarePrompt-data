Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not satisfy the problem's requirements. The function `func_1` generates a permutation by reversing every other element starting from the first element, which does not guarantee that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) will exist such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

For example, consider the input `n = 4`. The generated permutation would be `[4, 3, 2, 1]`. Here, \(p_1 = 4\) divides \(p_3 = 2\) and \(p_2 = 3\) divides \(p_4 = 1\), which violates the condition.

A correct approach would involve generating a permutation where the divisibility condition is inherently avoided. One possible solution could be to interleave elements in a way that avoids the divisibility condition, such as using a pattern like `[n, 1, n-1, 2, ..., 2, n-2, 1]` for even \(n\) or similar patterns for odd \(n\).
