Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside `func_1`, a list `a` is created containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The list `a` is then modified so that every other element starting from the first element is reversed.
   - This results in a permutation where odd-indexed elements are in descending order and even-indexed elements are in ascending order.
3. **Validation**:
   - For a permutation generated in this manner, no pair of indices `(i, j)` (with `i â‰  j`) will satisfy the condition that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. 
     - If `i` is odd and `j` is even, `p_i` is in descending order and `p_{i+1}` is in ascending order, making it impossible for `p_i` to divide `p_{i+1}` and `p_{j}` to divide `p_{j+1}`.
     - Similarly, if both `i` and `j` are either odd or even, the sequence ensures that no division relationship exists between consecutive pairs in the specified manner.
4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the generated permutation.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the proposed solution generates a valid permutation for each test case. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**
