Postcondition: `i` is length(s) + 1, `cur` is such that when shifted left by (length(s) + 1) bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the integer `ord('a') + i`, provided that `cur & 1 << i` is 0. If the condition `cur & 1 << i` is not 0, then the values of `i`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
