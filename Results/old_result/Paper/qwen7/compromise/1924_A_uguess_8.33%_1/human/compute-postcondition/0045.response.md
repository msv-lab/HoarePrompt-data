Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the original string `s` and `i` must be less than `k`; `cur` is such that when shifted left by `i` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0; `tmp` is a character which is 'a' plus `i`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to the variable `tmp`. Here, `ord('a')` returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97. Adding `i` to this value gives the ASCII value of the character that is `i` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet. Since `i` is the length of the original string `s` and `i` must be less than `k`, `tmp` will be a character starting from 'a' up to the character corresponding to the value of `i`. The values of `i`, `cur`, and `k` remain unchanged.
