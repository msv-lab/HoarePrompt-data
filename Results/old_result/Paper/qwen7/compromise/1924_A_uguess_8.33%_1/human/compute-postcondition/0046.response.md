Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of the original string `s` and `i` must be less than `k`; `cur` is such that when shifted left by `i` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0; `tmp` is a character which is 'a' plus `i`, and the program does not change `tmp` if the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` is met.
