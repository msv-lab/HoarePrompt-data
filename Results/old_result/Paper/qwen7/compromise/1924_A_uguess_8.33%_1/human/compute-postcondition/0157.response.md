Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`, the current value of `cur` does not have the `i`-th bit set to 1, `tmp` is 'a' + `i`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` calculates the character corresponding to the index `i` in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc.). Since `i` is the length of the input string `s`, `tmp` will be the character at position `i` in the alphabet. The value of `tmp` is specifically calculated as `'a' + i`, meaning it is the character resulting from adding `i` to the ASCII value of 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
