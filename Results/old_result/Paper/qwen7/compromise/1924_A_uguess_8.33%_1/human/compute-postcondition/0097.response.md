Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string.**

The code initializes `tmp` as an empty string, but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
