Output State: **The loop will execute exactly `k` times, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `cur` will always be 0, `tmp` will hold the character 'a', and `ans` will contain the character 'a' added `n - cnt - 1` times.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` appends the string `'a'` repeated `n - cnt - 1` times to the existing value of `ans`. Since `cnt` is not defined in the given context, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know that `ans` will be updated accordingly. The other variables `i`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
