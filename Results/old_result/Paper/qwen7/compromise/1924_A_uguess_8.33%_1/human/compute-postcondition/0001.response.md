Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `t`**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter.
   - The variable `t` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start from 0 (the default starting point of `range`) and `t` must be at least 1.
   - Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` will start from 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
