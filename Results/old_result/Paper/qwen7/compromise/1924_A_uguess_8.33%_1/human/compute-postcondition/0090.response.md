Postcondition: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0.** 

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is true, then `cur` becomes 0 and `cnt` becomes 3. If the condition is false, `cur` remains unchanged and is still 0, while `cnt` is also 3.
