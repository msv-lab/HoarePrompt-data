Output State: `i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will have been incremented each time the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met. Given that the loop increments `cnt` every time this condition is true, and it has already executed 3 times as per the provided states, it implies that the loop will continue to execute until `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1` for the third time. Since `cur` resets to 0 after each successful increment of `cnt`, the final state of `cur` will be 0. The variable `t` will have been decremented by 3 because the loop executes once for each decrement of `t`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
