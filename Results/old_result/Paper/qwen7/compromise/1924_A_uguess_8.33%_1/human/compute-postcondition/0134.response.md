Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 2, `cur` is `cur | (1 << cur_ss)`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` will evaluate to 1 if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is set in `cur`.**

Explanation: The line `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by setting the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` (which is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of `'a'`). Since `cur_ss` was initially 0 (as `cnt` is 2 and the bit corresponding to 0 is not set), `cur` is updated to include the bit at position `cur_ss`. Therefore, `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` will now evaluate to 1 because the bit at position `cur_ss` is set.
