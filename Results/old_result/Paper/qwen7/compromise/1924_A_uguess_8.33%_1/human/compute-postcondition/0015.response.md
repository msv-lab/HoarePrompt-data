Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. The values of `s`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states. `cnt` is incremented by 1, but since the increment operation is not explicitly shown in the code snippet, we assume it was done before this line.
