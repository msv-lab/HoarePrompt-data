Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s` + 1, `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`, and `tmp` is 'a' + `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `'a' + i` to the variable `tmp`. Since `i` is the length of the input string `s` + 1, `tmp` is calculated as 'a' + (length of `s` + 1). All other variables (`i`, `k`, and `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
