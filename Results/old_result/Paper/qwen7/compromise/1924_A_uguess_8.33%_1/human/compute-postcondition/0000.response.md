Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
