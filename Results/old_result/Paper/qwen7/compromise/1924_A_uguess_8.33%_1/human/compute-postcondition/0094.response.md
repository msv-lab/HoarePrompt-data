Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `t` is `t - 9`, but since `t` is not initialized or given an explicit value, we cannot determine its exact value from the information provided.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers.
- `cnt` is explicitly set to 3.
- `cur` is explicitly set to 0.
- The condition `(cnt >= n)` is true, meaning `cnt` (which is 3) is indeed greater than or equal to `n`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
