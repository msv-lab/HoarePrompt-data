Output State: **The loop will execute exactly `k` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`. `cur` will always be 0 because it gets reset to 0 every time `i` increments past its current value. `tmp` will hold the character 'a' for the first iteration and will not be updated further since the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` will never be true again.**

In more detail, after the loop completes:
- `i` will be `k + 1` because it starts at `k` and increments by 1 each time through the loop, executing `k` times.
- `cur` will be 0 after the first iteration and will remain 0 because the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` is checked against the new value of `i` each time, and once `i` exceeds the initial value of `k`, `cur` is not modified again.
- `tmp` will contain the character 'a' from the first iteration and will not be updated further as the loop condition is no longer met.
