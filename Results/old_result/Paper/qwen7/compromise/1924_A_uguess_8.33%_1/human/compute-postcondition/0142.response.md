Postcondition: `i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is either `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` or remains unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
