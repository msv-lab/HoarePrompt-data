Output State: `i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains unchanged as it is the length of the input string `s`. The variable `t` is decremented by 3 because the loop executes 3 times. The variables `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The variable `cnt` is 3 because the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met 3 times, incrementing `cnt` each time. Finally, `cur` is 0 as it resets to 0 at the end of each iteration when the condition is met.
