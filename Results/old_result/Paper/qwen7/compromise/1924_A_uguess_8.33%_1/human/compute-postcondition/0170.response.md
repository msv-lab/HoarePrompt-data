Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s` + `k`, `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `tmp` is the string 'abc...' repeated `cnt` times, `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times + `tmp`, `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times + `tmp` + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)**

Explanation: The code appends `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to the existing value of `ans`. Since `n` is the same as `cnt` in this context (as `ans` was previously defined as the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times + `tmp`), the updated value of `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times + `tmp` + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
