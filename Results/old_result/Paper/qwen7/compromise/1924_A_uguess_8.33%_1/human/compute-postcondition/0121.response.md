Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, a new string `s` is taken as input.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
