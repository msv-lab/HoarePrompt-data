Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s` + `k`, `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `tmp` is the string 'abc...' repeated `cnt` times, `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times + `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += tmp` adds the string `tmp` to the existing value of `ans`. Since `tmp` is the string 'abc...' repeated `cnt` times, `ans` now includes this additional part. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
