### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Score Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. This is necessary because the total points distributed must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being awarded or 2 points being split between two players).
3. **Total Points Calculation**: The program calculates the total points `x` by dividing the sum of the scores by 2. This value represents the total points that should be distributed among the players if there were no draws.
4. **Points from Wins and Draws**: The program calculates `y` as the sum of the points of the first two players `a + b`. This value represents the points that would be distributed if all games resulted in wins and losses.
5. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which effectively gives the maximum number of draws possible. This is because:
   - `x` represents the total points that need to be distributed.
   - `y` represents the points that can be distributed without any draws (i.e., all wins and losses).

However, there is a flaw in the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws. The program does not account for the possibility that the scores might not be achievable through a valid sequence of games and results. Specifically, the program does not check if the scores are consistent with the constraints of the game.

### Example Analysis:

- **Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Total points: \(0 + 0 + 0 = 0\) (even)
  - \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\)
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Total points: \(0 + 1 + 1 = 2\) (even)
  - \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\)
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\) (even)
  - \(x = 2\), \(y = 2\)
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Total points: \(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\) (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Total points: \(3 + 4 + 5 = 12\) (even)
  - \(x = 6\), \(y = 7\)
  - Output: `6` (Incorrect, should be `-1`)

- **Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 10 = 12\) (even)
  - \(x = 6\), \(y = 2\)
  - Output: `2` (Incorrect, should be `-1`)

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the scores are inconsistent with the game rules. Therefore, the given program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
