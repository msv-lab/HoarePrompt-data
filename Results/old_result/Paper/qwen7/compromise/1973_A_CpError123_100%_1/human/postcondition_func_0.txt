The function reads a positive integer `t` and `t` test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum value between half of the sum `(a + b + c) // 2` and the sum of `a` and `b` (`a + b`). It then prints this minimum value for each test case.
