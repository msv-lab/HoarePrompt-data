Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 â‰¤ `a_i` â‰¤ 10^7, and the list `a` is populated with integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The length of this list `a` is determined by the value of `n`, which was an input integer. Each element in the list `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^7, inclusive.
