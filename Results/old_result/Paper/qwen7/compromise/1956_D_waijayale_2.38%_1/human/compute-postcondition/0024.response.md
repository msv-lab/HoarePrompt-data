The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and implicitly a list `a` (since `l` and `r` refer to indices within a list). The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. The function does not directly take the list `a` as a parameter but uses it internally through the indices `l` and `r`.

The functionality of the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is to return the maximum sum of subarrays within the bounds specified by `l` and `r` in the list `a`. This is achieved through a recursive process that explores different subarray sums within the given range.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l` and `r`, which define the range within a list `a` (where `a` is a list of integers), and returns the maximum sum of any subarray within the range `[l, r]` in the list `a`.**
