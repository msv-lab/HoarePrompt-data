Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `recursive_maximize_sum` are defined but not properly integrated into the main logic. Specifically, the function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without defining it correctly within its scope.

2. **Logic Errors in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - In `func_1`, there's a mistake where the function tries to modify the array and append operations but does not correctly handle the base case when `l == r`. If `a[l]` is already equal to `r - l + 1`, it should not change anything.
   - In `recursive_maximize_sum`, the logic to maximize the sum of the subarray is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that setting all elements in a subarray to the maximum value in that subarray will maximize the sum, which is not always true.

3. **Missing Initialization of `ops`**: The variable `ops` is used in `func_1` and `func_2` but is not initialized before use. This will lead to errors during execution.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The operations are not being constructed correctly. The program needs to ensure that the operations are performed in a way that maximizes the sum of the array while adhering to the constraints.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to rethink the approach to maximize the sum of the array by ensuring that each segment of the array is filled with the smallest possible value that is not present in that segment. This can be done using a greedy approach or dynamic programming, but the current implementation is flawed and does not achieve the desired result.
