Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is a string representation of the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the integer `k` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. The resulting string is stored in the variable `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
