Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is the string representation of the binary form of `f` without the '0b' prefix, now `l` is updated to be the binary representation of `f` without '0b'; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\); `f` is non-zero and has at least two bits set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` updates the variable `l` to be the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
