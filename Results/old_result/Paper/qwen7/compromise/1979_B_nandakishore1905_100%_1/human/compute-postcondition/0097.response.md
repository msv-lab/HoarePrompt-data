Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Depending on the value of `k`, `k` remains unchanged if it is a power of 2 or odd, or is adjusted to `k - 14` if it is even and at least 14. `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2` (without the '0b' prefix), `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is `k - 14`. If `k` is odd or even but less than 14, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2`, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, and `f` is 0.**
