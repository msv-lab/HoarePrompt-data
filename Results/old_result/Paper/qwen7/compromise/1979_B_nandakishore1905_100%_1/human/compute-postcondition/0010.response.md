Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state defines that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` is equal to `t`. The value of `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line, but the specific value of `m` is not provided. The value of `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it is specified that `k` is not a power of two and is currently odd. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.
