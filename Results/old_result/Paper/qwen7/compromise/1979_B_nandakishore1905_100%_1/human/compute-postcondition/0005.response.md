Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`).

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.

To determine the exact value of `k`, we need to consider the constraints and properties given:

1. `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
2. `k` must be a power of 2.

Given these conditions, `k` could be any power of 2 within the range of possible differences between two integers where one integer is `t` and the other is the second integer input. Since `k` is a power of 2, it could be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., up to the maximum possible difference under the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

However, without specific values for `t` and `m`, we cannot determine a precise numerical value for `k`. Therefore, the output will depend on the actual inputs provided during runtime.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and k is a power of 2)**
