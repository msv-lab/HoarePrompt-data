Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must be at least 6, `l` is a binary string representation of `k - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is the binary string representation of `k - 6` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is 2, `f` is `f - 2`**.

This means that the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting 2 from its original value, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
