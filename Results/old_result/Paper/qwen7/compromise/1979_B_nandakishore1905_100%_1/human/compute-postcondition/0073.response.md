Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, if `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged, otherwise if `k` is odd, `k` remains unchanged, if `k` is even and at least 14, then `k` is adjusted to be `k - 14`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2`, `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is `k - 14`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2` without '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the value of `k - 2` into its binary string representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `p`, and `f` remain as per their initial conditions, with `l` being updated to reflect the binary string of `k - 2`.
