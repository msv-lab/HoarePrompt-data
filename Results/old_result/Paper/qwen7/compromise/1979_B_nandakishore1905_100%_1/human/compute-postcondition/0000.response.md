Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.
   - Therefore, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts from 0).

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must equal `t`, because the loop will run for `t` iterations.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `int(input())` equals `t` for the loop to execute properly. 

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `int(input())` must be equal to `t`.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:
**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**.
