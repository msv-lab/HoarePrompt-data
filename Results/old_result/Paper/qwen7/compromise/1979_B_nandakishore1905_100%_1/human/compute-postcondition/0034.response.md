Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two, and if `k` is odd, `k` remains unchanged. If `k` is even, `k` becomes zero, and additional variables `l`, `p`, and `q` are defined such that `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
