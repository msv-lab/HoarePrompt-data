Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is incremented by 1, but since the value of `i` itself is not needed for the print statement, we can ignore it.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The print statement is `print(k)`, which means it will print the value of `k`.

Since `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, the print statement will output this value.

Output: **the absolute difference between n and m**
