### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` can have lowercase or uppercase letters. If a letter in `t` is lowercase, the corresponding letter in `a`, `b`, or `c` must match. If a letter in `t` is uppercase, the corresponding letter in `a`, `b`, or `c` must not match.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` currently checks if for every character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `c[i]`.
   - This is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same position, which is not enough to determine if a valid template exists.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` for each.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if a valid template exists. It only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same position, which is not enough to determine if a valid template exists.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a combination of lowercase and uppercase characters in `t` such that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. This involves more complex logic than what `func_1` provides.

5. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of `func_1` and `func_2`. The function `func_1` indeed only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same position, which is not sufficient.
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases and prints the results, but the logic within `func_1` is flawed.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the problem description and the annotated code, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if a valid template exists. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
