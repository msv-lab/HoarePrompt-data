Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]`.
   - If such an index is found where both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` for any `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such index exists, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic correctly identifies if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - The logic here is correct as it processes each test case individually and prints the correct result based on the outcome of `func_1`.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it correctly identifies if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
   - The output format matches the expected output as per the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program is designed to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
