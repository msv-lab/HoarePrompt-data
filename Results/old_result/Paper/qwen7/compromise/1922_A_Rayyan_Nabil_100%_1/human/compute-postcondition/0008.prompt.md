You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the corresponding iteration. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and for each iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, while `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The output state will be the same as the initial state because the loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. The `results` list remains unchanged after the loop executes all the iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but uses internal variables t (an integer between 1 and 1000) and n (an integer between 1 and 20), along with strings a, b, and c (each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters). It returns a value based on the comparison and manipulation of these variables and strings.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
