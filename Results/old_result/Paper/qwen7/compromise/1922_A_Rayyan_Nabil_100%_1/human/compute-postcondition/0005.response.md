Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `result` from the list `results`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `result`**: Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the initial state of `result` must be one of the elements in the `results` list.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in the `results` list. Each element in the `results` list is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for some iteration.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the `results` list has at least one element. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust the specific values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c` for each iteration, as these are defined within the function `func_1`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of the `results` list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` is a list containing at least 1 element**
