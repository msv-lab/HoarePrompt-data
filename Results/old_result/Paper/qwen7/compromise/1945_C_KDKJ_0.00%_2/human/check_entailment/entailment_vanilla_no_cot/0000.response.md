Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `n` is read as an integer, representing the number of houses.
   - A string `a` is read, representing the preferences of the residents (0 for left, 1 for right).

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - A list `S` is initialized with `[0, 0]` to store the cumulative counts of residents preferring left (`0`) and right (`1`).
   - For each character in the string `a`, the counts are updated and appended to `S`.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - A variable `ans` is initialized to `0` to store the optimal position.
   - A loop iterates through each possible position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
     - `left` is the count of residents preferring left up to position `i`.
     - `lsum` is the total count of residents up to position `i`.
     - `right` is the count of residents preferring right from position `i+1` to the end.
     - `rsum` is the total count of residents from position `i+1` to the end.
   - If the conditions `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` are not met, the position `i` is skipped.
   - Otherwise, the position `i` is checked against the current `ans` to see if it minimizes the distance from the center of the village (`abs(n / 2 - i)`). If it does, `i` is set as `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the optimal position `ans`.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

The logic ensures that the road is placed such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, and it finds the position closest to the middle of the village. The implementation is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
