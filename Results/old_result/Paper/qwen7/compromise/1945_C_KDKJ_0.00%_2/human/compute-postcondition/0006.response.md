Output State: **`a` is an input string consisting only of '0' and '1', `n` is the length of the input string `a`, `S` is a list containing `n` sublists, each sublist contains two elements where the first element represents the count of '0's encountered up to that point in the string `a`, and the second element represents the count of '1's encountered up to that point, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, or `S`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
