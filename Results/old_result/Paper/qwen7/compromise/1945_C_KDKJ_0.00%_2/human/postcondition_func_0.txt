The function accepts an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It constructs a list `S` where each element is a sublist containing the counts of '0's and '1's encountered up to that point in the string `a`. After processing the string, it finds an index `i` that satisfies a specific condition related to the counts of '0's and '1's on both sides of the index. If such an index exists, it returns the value of `i`; otherwise, it returns 0.
