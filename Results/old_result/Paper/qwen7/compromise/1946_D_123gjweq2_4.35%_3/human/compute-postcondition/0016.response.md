Postcondition: `xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation on the subarray of `cur_arr` where the specified bit is either 0 or 1, `thing1` is -1 since the if condition is true (i.e., the bit in `xor` is 1).
