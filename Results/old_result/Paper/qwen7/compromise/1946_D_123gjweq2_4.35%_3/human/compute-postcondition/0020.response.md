Output State: **The program returns -1 if the bit in `xor` is 0, otherwise it returns the maximum value found in `new_arr` for the bit-1 position.**

Explanation:
- The variable `thing1` is defined as `-1` if the condition (`if` condition) is false, which means if the corresponding bit in `xor` is `0`.
- If the condition is true, `thing1` is set to the maximum value found in `new_arr` for the bit-1 position.
- Since the code only returns `thing1`, the output depends on whether the bit in `xor` is `0` or not.
- If the bit in `xor` is `0`, `thing1` will be `-1`, and if the bit is `1`, `thing1` will be the maximum value from `new_arr` for that bit position.
- Therefore, the program returns either `-1` or the maximum value from `new_arr` for the bit-1 position.
