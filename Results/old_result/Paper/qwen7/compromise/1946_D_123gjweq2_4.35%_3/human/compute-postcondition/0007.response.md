Output State: `xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a segment of the input array a, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of the XOR operation on the subarray of `cur_arr` up to the point where the resulting XOR value's `bit`-th bit is set to 1, and `thing1` is 0.

In simpler terms, `new_arr` contains the cumulative XOR values of subarrays from the start of `cur_arr` up to the point where the `bit`-th bit of the XOR result becomes 1 for the first time. All other variables remain unchanged.
