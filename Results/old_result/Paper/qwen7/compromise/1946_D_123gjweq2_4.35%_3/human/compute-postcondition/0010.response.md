Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation on the subarray of `cur_arr` where the specified bit is 0, `thing1` is -1.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `-1` to the variable `thing1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `(xor >> bit & 1)` being true does not affect the values of the variables since no operations involving these variables are performed.
