Postcondition: `count_b` is increased by 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be at least 1, `count_a` is increased by 1, `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.
