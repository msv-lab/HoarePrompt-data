Output State: **`len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code assigns the length of list `a` to `len_a` and the length of list `b` to `len_b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
