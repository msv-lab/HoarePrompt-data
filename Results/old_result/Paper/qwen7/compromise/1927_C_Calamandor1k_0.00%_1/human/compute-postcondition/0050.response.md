Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from another input string split on spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes another input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
