Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and maps each element to an integer. This new list of integers is assigned to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
