Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
