You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It calculates and prints the side length of the square, rounded to the nearest integer. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - We are given the coordinates of the corners in no particular order.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners and stores them in a list called `coord`.
   - It then sorts the coordinates. However, sorting the coordinates might not be necessary for finding the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the distances between pairs of points to determine the side length.
     - `p1` is calculated as the squared distance between the first and second points.
     - `p2` is calculated as the squared distance between the third and fourth points.
   - It then takes the square root of these distances and multiplies them to get the area of the square.
   - The result is rounded before printing.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The approach of calculating the squared distances between pairs of points and then taking the square root to find the side length is correct.
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distances between the points should give us the side length directly.
   - The rounding of the result is unnecessary since the area will always be an integer (as the side length is an integer).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles multiple test cases correctly by decrementing `n` after processing each case.
   - The input constraints are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
