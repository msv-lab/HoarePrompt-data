Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has a logical error in calculating the side length of the square. Specifically, the approach used to calculate `p1` and `p2` does not correctly identify the side lengths of the square. 

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate all pairwise distances between points
        distances = [
            (math.sqrt((coord[i][0] - coord[j][0])**2 + (coord[i][1] - coord[j][1])**2), i, j)
            for i in range(4) for j in range(i+1, 4)
        ]
        
        # Find the smallest distance which should be the side length of the square
        min_distance = min(distances)[0]
        
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        area = min_distance ** 2
        
        print(int(area))
        n -= 1

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Collect Coordinates**: Collect the coordinates of the four corners.
2. **Calculate Distances**: Compute all pairwise distances between the points.
3. **Identify Side Length**: The smallest distance among these pairs will be the side length of the square.
4. **Compute Area**: Square the side length to get the area of the square.
5. **Output**: Print the area.

This approach ensures that the correct side length of the square is identified and the area is calculated accurately.
