Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

    #State: Output State: `n` is 0, `i` is 0, `res` is the result of the last iteration's calculation, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the fourth split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), and (sorted(x, y)), `p1` is 0, `p2` is ((sorted(x, y))[0] - 1)² + ((sorted(x, y))[1] - 1)².
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `i` will be 0 as the loop body does not change its value and it starts at 0. `res` will hold the result of the last iteration's calculation, which involves the Euclidean distances between certain points in the `coord` list. The `x` and `y` values will be the inputs from the last set of coordinates entered, and `coord` will contain the sorted coordinates with the last set of coordinates appended. The values of `p1` and `p2` will be calculated based on these coordinates as described.
