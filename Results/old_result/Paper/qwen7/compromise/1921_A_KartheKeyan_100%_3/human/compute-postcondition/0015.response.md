Output State: `i` is 4, `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)).

This means that after the loop has executed all 4 iterations, `i` will be 4 (since the loop runs from 0 to 3, inclusive), and `coord` will contain tuples for each of the 4 inputs provided. The specific values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers entered, as those are the ones assigned in the third and fourth iterations of the loop.
