Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers from the fourth input split.
   - `coord` is a list containing four tuples: `((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y))` sorted by the first element of each tuple.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first point in `coord`.
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third point in `coord`.
   - `res` is the square root of `p1 * p2`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(round(res))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `coord` is a list of four tuples, and they are sorted by the first element of each tuple, it means that the tuples are already in order. Therefore, the second and first points are the same, and the fourth and third points are also the same.
   - The squared distance between two identical points \((x, y)\) and \((x, y)\) is \(0\). Thus, both `p1` and `p2` will be \(0\).
   - `res` is the square root of `p1 * p2`, which is \(\sqrt{0 * 0} = \sqrt{0} = 0\).

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `round` function will round `0` to the nearest integer, which is still `0`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0**
