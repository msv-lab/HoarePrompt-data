Output State: **`x` is an integer from the second input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `coord` is a list containing two tuples ((x, y), (x, y)), `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code `coord.append((x, y))` appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `coord` initially contains one tuple `(x, y)`, after appending, it will contain two identical tuples. The values of `x` and `y` remain the same as they were in the second input split. The values of `i` and `coord` are updated accordingly.
