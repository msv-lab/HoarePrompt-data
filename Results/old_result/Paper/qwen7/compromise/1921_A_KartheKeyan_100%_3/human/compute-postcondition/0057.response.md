Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the fourth split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), and (sorted(x, y)), `p1` is 0.**

Explanation: The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the first two points in the `coord` list, which are both (1, 1). The distance is \((1 - 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2 = 0\). All other variables remain unchanged.
