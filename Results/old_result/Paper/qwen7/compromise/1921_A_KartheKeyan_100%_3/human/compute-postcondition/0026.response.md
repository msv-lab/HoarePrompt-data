Output State: **`x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state specifies that `x` and `y` now hold integers from the input, while other variables retain their unspecified initial values.
