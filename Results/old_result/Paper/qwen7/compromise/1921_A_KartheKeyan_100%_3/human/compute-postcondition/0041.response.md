`n` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 3. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `coord`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)) sorted by the first element of each tuple, `i` is 4, `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first point in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third point in `coord`, `res` is the square root of `p1 * p2`, and `n` is 3.
