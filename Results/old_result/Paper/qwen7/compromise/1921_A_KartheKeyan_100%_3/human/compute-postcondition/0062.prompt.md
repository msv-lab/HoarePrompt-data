Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed; `s` is the sum of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each test case; `n` is the input integer.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)
    print(round(res))
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on their first element, `p2` is the square of the difference between the first elements of the third and second tuples plus the square of the difference between the second elements of the third and second tuples, `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)) sorted by the first element of each tuple, `i` is 4, `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first point in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third point in `coord`, `res` is the square root of `p1 * p2`, and `n` is 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `res` is sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the fourth split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), and (sorted(x, y)), `p1` is 0, `p2` is ((sorted(x, y))[0] - 1)² + ((sorted(x, y))[1] - 1)².


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
