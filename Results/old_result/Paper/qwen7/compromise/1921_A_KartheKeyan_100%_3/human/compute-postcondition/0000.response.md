Output State: **`t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed; `s` is the sum of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each test case; `n` is 0.**

Explanation: The code processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and calculates `s` as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`. This value is then printed, and `n` is decremented until it reaches 0. After processing all test cases, `n` is 0, and `s` holds the cumulative sum of the calculated values for each test case. The initial value of `t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed.
