Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is the square of the difference between the first elements of the third and second tuples plus the square of the difference between the second elements of the third and second tuples, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` sets the variable `res` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
