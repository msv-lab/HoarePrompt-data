Output State: **`res` is sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2), `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the fourth split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), and (sorted(x, y)), `p1` is 0, `p2` is ((sorted(x, y))[0] - 1)² + ((sorted(x, y))[1] - 1)².**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `res` as the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
- Initially, `p1` is 0.
- `p2` is calculated as `((sorted(x, y))[0] - 1)² + ((sorted(x, y))[1] - 1)²`. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, `sorted(x, y)` will be a tuple with the smaller value first. Let's denote the sorted values as `(min(x, y), max(x, y))`.
- Therefore, `p2` becomes `((min(x, y) - 1)² + (max(x, y) - 1)²)`.
- The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `coord`, and `p1` remain unchanged.

Since `p1` is 0, `res` simplifies to `sqrt(0) * sqrt(p2) = 0 * sqrt(p2) = 0`. However, the exact value of `p2` depends on the inputs `x` and `y`, so we keep it in the expression form.
