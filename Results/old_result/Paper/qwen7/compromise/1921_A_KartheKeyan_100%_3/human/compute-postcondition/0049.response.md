Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer from the first split, `y` is an input integer from the second split, `coord` is a list containing one tuple (`x`, `y`).**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The variable `res` remains unchanged with its initial value of 0, and `i` also remains unchanged with its initial value of 1. The list `coord` is updated to contain the new tuple `(x, y)`.
