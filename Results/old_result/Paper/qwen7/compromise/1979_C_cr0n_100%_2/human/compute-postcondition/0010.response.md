Based on the initial state provided:

- `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `den` divided by each corresponding element in `vals`.
- `den` is the result of successively applying `func_1` to the first element of `vals` and each subsequent element in `vals`.
- `den` is then updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
- The value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

Given this information, the print statement `print(-1)` will simply output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
