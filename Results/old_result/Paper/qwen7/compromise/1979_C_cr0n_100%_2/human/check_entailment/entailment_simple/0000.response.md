Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\) and the total bet must be less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for any \(i\).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \). This is used to find a common denominator for all multipliers.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - It reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and a list of multipliers \(vals\).
     - It calculates the LCM of all multipliers using `func_1`.
     - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the result of dividing the LCM by each corresponding multiplier.
     - It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from the LCM to get the remaining value `den`.
     - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
     - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod` which represent the bets.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The approach of finding the LCM of all multipliers ensures that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers.
   - Dividing this LCM by each multiplier gives a valid bet for each outcome such that the total bet is less than the payout for any outcome.
   - The subtraction of the sum of `vprod` from the LCM ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any outcome, satisfying the problem's requirement.

Given the above analysis, the code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
