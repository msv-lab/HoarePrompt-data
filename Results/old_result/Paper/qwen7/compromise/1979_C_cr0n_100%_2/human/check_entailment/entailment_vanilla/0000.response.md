Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires distributing coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. 

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code includes two functions:

1. **func_1(a, b):**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - It uses the formula: \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}\).

2. **func_2():**
   - This function processes the input for a single test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - It computes the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers.
   - It then divides this LCM by each multiplier to get the required bet amounts.
   - Finally, it checks if the remaining value (after subtracting the sum of these bet amounts from the LCM) is positive. If not, it prints `-1`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Understanding the LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM of all multipliers \( k_i \) ensures that the bet amounts are such that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers.
   - This helps in ensuring that the total bet is a feasible amount that can be evenly divided by each \( k_i \).

2. **Bet Amount Calculation:**
   - For each multiplier \( k_i \), the bet amount \( x_i \) is calculated as \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \).
   - This ensures that the total bet \( \sum x_i \) is a multiple of each \( k_i \).

3. **Validation:**
   - After calculating the bet amounts, the code checks if the remaining value (LCM minus the sum of bet amounts) is positive.
   - If the remaining value is non-positive, it means the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome, hence printing `-1`.

### Correctness Check
- The logic in `func_2()` correctly implements the requirement to find a distribution of coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome.
- The use of LCM ensures that the bet amounts are feasible and can be evenly divided by each multiplier.
- The validation step ensures that the condition is met.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**
