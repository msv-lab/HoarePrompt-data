Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `den`**: The variable `den` is initialized with the first value from the input list and then updated using the `func_1` function. This approach does not correctly calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers. Instead, it calculates the product of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of pairs of numbers, which is not equivalent to the LCM.

2. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: Even if the calculation of `den` were correct, the logic for distributing the coins (`vprod`) is flawed. It divides `den` by each multiplier `r` in the list, which doesn't ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

3. **Handling of Test Cases**: The code reads from standard input and processes only one test case at a time. Since the problem specifies multiple test cases, this implementation would need to be modified to handle all test cases.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find a way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. One effective method is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers and then distribute the coins accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function to compute LCM of two numbers
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Function to compute LCM of a list of numbers
def lcm_list(lst):
    return reduce(lcm, lst)

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
        l = lcm_list(vals)
        if l < min(vals):
            print(-1)
        else:
            result = [l // val for val in vals]
            print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

# Call the main function
solve()
```

This corrected program uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to compute the LCM of the list of multipliers. It then checks if the LCM is less than the minimum multiplier, and if so, prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the distribution of coins and prints the result.
