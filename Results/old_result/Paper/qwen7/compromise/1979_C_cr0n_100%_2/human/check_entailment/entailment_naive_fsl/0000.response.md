Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to distribute the coins based on finding a common denominator, but it does not ensure that the total bet amount is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
- Expected Output:
```
-1
```
However, the program will output a valid distribution of bets because it calculates the common denominator and distributes the bets accordingly, which does not guarantee that the total bet amount is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.

To illustrate, for the above input, the program would calculate `den` as 5 and `vprod` as `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, resulting in a total bet of 5, which is not strictly less than 5 (the reward for any winning outcome).

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirement in all cases, making it incorrect.
