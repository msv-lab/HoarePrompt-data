Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it handles the operations. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the operations as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Operation Type 1**: Appending an integer `x` to the end of the array.
2. **Operation Type 2**: Appending `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not handle the second type of operation correctly. When `op_type` is 2, it simply repeats the entire array `x` times instead of appending `x` copies of the current array. This leads to incorrect results.

To fix this, we need to maintain the state of the array correctly after each operation. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            # Append value copies of the current array
            array.extend(array * value)
    result = []
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)

# Function call to process input and output
func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that when an operation of type 2 is encountered, the current array is repeated `x` times and appended to the end of the array, maintaining the correct structure as specified in the problem statement.
