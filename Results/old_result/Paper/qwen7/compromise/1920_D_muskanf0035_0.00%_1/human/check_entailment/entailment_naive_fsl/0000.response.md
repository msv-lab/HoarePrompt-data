Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly simulate the appending of `x` copies of the array to itself when the operation type is 2. Instead, it simply repeats each element of the current array `x` times, which does not match the requirement of appending `x` copies of the entire array.

For example, consider the following operations and queries:

- Operations: 
  1. Append 1 (array becomes [1])
  2. Append 1 copy of the array (array remains [1])
  3. Append 3 (array becomes [1, 3])
  4. Append 3 copies of the array (array becomes [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3])

- Queries: [4]

The 4th element of the final array should be 3, but the program incorrectly returns 1 because it does not properly simulate the appending of the entire array multiple times.
