### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function processes the operations and queries.
- **Steps**:
  1. Initializes an empty list `array`.
  2. Iterates through the operations:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the `array`.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` with `x` copies of itself.
  3. For each query, it appends the `(k-1)`-th element of the `array` to the result list using modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function handles multiple test cases.
- **Steps**:
  1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  2. For each test case:
     - Reads the values of `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the operations and stores them in a list.
     - Reads the queries and stores them in a list.
     - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
     - Prints the result.

### Analysis:

1. **Operation Processing**:
   - The function correctly handles both types of operations:
     - Appending a single value (`op_type == 1`).
     - Extending the array with `x` copies of itself (`op_type == 2`).

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The function uses the modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array. This is correct because the array can grow very large, and we need to find the correct element within the current size of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the cyclic nature of the array, which is crucial given the large sizes involved.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each query.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to process the operations and answer the queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
