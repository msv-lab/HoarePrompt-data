Output State: **The program returns an empty list for result**

This is because the initial state shows that `array` is an empty list and `result` is also an empty list. The loop attempts to append elements to `result` based on indices from `queries`, but since `array` is empty, accessing any index would raise an IndexError, preventing any operations from being performed. Thus, `result` remains an empty list after the loop.
