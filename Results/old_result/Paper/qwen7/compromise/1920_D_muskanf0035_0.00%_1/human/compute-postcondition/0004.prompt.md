You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of operations, q is an integer representing the number of queries, operations is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers indicating the type of operation (1 or 2) and the value x, and queries is a list of integers representing the positions k for which the k-th element of the final array a needs to be determined.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` times, for each query `k` in `queries`, the result is the value of the `k-th` element in the final array `a` after applying all operations from `operations` on an initial array of length `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of operations), `q` (an integer representing the number of queries), `operations` (a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers indicating the type of operation and the value x), and `queries` (a list of integers representing the positions k for which the k-th element of the final array a needs to be determined). It returns a list of integers representing the values at the specified positions in the final array after performing all the operations.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
