Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `buffer`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid, but since `t` is not used in the given code, its value remains as per the initial state.
