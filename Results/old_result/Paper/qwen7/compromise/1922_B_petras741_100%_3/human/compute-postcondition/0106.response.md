Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(1, eta_ln)`. Therefore, the variables `j` and `eta_ln` are the ones that need to be adjusted.

2. **Determine the Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `eta_ln` must be at least 2.
   - `j` is currently 3.
   - `res` has been updated by some expression involving `q[3]` and `q[eta[3]]`.
   - `rho` has been updated by adding `q[eta[j]]`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `eta_ln`. Currently, `j` is 3. To proceed to the next iteration, `j` should be incremented to 4.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 4. The value of `eta_ln` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as the previous iteration.

5. **Update the State**: The only states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `eta_ln`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`eta_ln` must be at least 2, `j` is 4**
