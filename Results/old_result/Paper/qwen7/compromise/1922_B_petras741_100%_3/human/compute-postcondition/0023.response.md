Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(n + 1)`. This means `j` starts from 0 up to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.
   - `eta` is a list containing the value `j`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n`, the next value of `j` would be `n - 1` (if `n > 0`).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `j` will be updated to `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Update the `eta` list**:
   - The `eta` list currently contains the value `j`, which is `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `eta` should contain the value `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n - 1`, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `n - 1`.**
