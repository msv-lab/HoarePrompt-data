State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `j` is 0, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.
2. The loop runs for `range(n)`, meaning `j` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`.
3. For the loop to execute, `j` must start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n`.
4. The other variables (`t`, `buffer`, `i`, and `q`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are those involving the loop variable `j`, which should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
