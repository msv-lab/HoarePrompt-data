Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `range(1, eta_ln)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j` being 1 because `range(1, eta_ln)` generates values from 1 to `eta_ln-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `eta_ln`.
   - Therefore, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.
   - `j` must be initialized to 1.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The variables `rho`, `res`, `eta`, and `q` are not part of the loop head and their initial states do not affect whether the loop can execute. They can remain unchanged.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.
- `j` must be 1.

Therefore, the final state is:

**`eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**.
