Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the sum of all terms calculated in the loop, which can be expressed as \(\sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho\). If `n` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated based on the sum of specific calculations involving elements from the `eta` list and the value of `rho`. If `n` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `buffer` is a list of integers from the input, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` in `eta` if `n >= 3`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `eta` contains all indices `j` from `0` to `n-1` for which `q[j]` is greater than `0`, the variable `q` remains unchanged, and `res` is the cumulative sum of the terms `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` in `eta` if `n >= 3`. Otherwise, `n` is less than 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
