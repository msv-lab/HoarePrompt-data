Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the sum of all terms calculated in the loop, which can be expressed as \(\sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho\), where `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `eta` is `[n - 2, n - 1]` if `n` is greater than 1 or `[0]` if `n` is 1, `eta_ln` is 1 if `n` is 1 or 2 if `n` is greater than 1, and `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values for `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is less than 3, `n` is an input integer and no specific changes are made to `res`.
