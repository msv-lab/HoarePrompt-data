Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is 0, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, and `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. However, the value of `w[j]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `q[w[j]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
