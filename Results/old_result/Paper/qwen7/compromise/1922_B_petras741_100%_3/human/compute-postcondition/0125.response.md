Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 1
- `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `j` is defined in the loop head. Therefore, we need to consider how `j` changes during each iteration.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`. Since `j` starts at 1, it means the loop has already executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2 (assuming `n > 1`).

### Updating the State
- `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value of 1 to 2.
- `q[w[1]]` is not directly affected by the loop itself but might be incremented again if the loop body increments it further. However, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine if it will be incremented again. Therefore, we assume it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State
- `j` will be 2.
- `q[w[1]]` remains unchanged unless the loop body increments it again, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume it stays the same.

### Answer
State: **`j` is 2, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1**
