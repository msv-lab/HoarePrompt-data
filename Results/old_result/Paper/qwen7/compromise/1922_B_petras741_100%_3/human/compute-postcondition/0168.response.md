Postcondition: **`rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` in `eta`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `eta` contains all indices `j` from `0` to `n-1` for which `q[j]` is greater than `0`, the variable `q` remains unchanged, and `res` is the cumulative sum of the terms `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` in `eta`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `rho` will be the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values where `j` ranges over the indices in the list `eta`. The length of the list `eta` is stored in `eta_ln`. The list `eta` contains all indices `j` from `0` to `n-1` for which `q[j]` is greater than `0`. The variable `q` remains unchanged throughout the process. Additionally, `res` will hold the cumulative sum of specific terms involving `q[eta[j]]` and `rho` for each `j` in `eta`.
