Postcondition: `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `eta` contains all indices `j` from `0` to `n-1` for which `q[j]` is greater than `0`, the variable `q` remains unchanged, and `j` takes on all values from `n-1` down to `0` during the loop's execution, and `eta_ln` is not equal to `1`.
