### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not match the problem description. Let's break down the issues and confirm the reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The problem requires calculating the year in which all \(n\) signs of the apocalypse will occur, given their periodicities.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with the number of signs and their periodicities.
   - The output should be the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function processes a string consisting of `@` and `*` characters.
     - It calculates some kind of dynamic programming solution, but it does not relate to the periodicities of the signs.
     - The function returns a maximum value from a list, but this value is not meaningful in the context of the problem.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - It processes the input correctly by reading the number of signs and the periodicities, but it uses `func_1` incorrectly as described above.

Given these observations, the code does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to determine the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities.
