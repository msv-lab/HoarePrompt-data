Output State: **`path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0; the first character of `path` is either '@' or '*', and if the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1, otherwise if the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to -inf; the value of `n` is greater than 1, and the second character of `path` is '*', and `dp[1]` is now -inf.**

The code `dp[1] = -float('inf')` sets the value of `dp[1]` to negative infinity (`-inf`). All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
