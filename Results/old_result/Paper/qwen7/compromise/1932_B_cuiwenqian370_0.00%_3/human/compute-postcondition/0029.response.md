Output State: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is `n`; `dp` is a list of length `n`, with `dp[0]` being either 1 or -inf depending on the first character of `path`, `dp[1]` being -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`, and for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is -inf if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', 0 otherwise.
