Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0. The value of `n` is greater than 1. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to -inf. The second character of `path` is not '*'.
