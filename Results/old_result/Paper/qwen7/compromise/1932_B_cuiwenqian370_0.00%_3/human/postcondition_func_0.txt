The function `func_1` accepts a string `path` consisting of '@' and '*' characters and returns either 0 or the maximum value among the elements in the list `dp` that are greater than negative infinity. If `path` is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element depends on previous elements based on the characters in `path`. The function finally returns the highest valid value in `dp` that is not negative infinity.
