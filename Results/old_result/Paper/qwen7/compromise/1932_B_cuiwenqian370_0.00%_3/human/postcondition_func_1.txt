The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by an integer `n` (number of signs), and then `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (periodicities of the signs). For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the given periodicities and stores these LCM values in a list. Finally, it prints each LCM value from the list.
