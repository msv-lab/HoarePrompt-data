Reasoning:
1. The problem statement requires determining if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
2. The solution logic in the provided code is as follows:
   - For each test case, it checks two conditions:
     1. If \( n \leq k \): In this case, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
     2. If \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil < k \): This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be repainted to achieve uniformity is more than \( k \). If so, Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, and the answer is 'YES'.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, the answer is 'NO'.

3. The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the given test cases accurately:
   - For \( n \leq k \), it correctly outputs 'NO'.
   - For \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil < k \), it correctly outputs 'YES'.
   - For other cases, it correctly outputs 'NO'.

4. The code also respects the constraints \( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \) and the number of test cases \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \).

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly solves the problem as per the problem statement and the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
