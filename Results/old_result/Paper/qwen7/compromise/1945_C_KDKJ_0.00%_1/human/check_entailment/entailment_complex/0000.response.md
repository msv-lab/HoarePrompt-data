Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each house position using a list `S`.
   - It then iterates through these counts to find an optimal position `i` where the number of residents preferring each side is balanced according to the given constraints.
   - The logic checks if the number of residents on each side is at least half of the total residents on that side, and if so, it updates the answer `ans` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the optimal position `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the logic of `func_1` is applied to each test case independently.
   - There is no interaction between different test cases, meaning the state of `a` is reset for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and constraints.
   - It applies the required logic to each test case separately.
   - The output matches the expected format and conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
