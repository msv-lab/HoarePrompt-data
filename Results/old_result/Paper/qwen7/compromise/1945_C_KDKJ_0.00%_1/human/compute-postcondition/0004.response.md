Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \)) consisting only of '0' and '1'. It reads an unknown number of inputs from the user, with each input representing the number of iterations for a loop that calls another undefined function `func_1()`. After the loop, the string `a` may have changed or remained the same, depending on what `func_1()` does.**
