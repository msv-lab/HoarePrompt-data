Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n (where 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) consisting only of '0' and '1'.**

Given the constraints, the function does not take any parameters but seems to generate a random string of '0's and '1's of a specified length. However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact behavior beyond the parameter constraints and the return type, the description focuses on what is explicitly stated.
