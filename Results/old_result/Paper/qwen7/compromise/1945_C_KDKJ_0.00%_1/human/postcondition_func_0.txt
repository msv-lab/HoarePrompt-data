The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses (with a constraint of 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates the number of '0's (left side preference) and '1's (right side preference) up to each position in the string and then finds an index where the distribution of preferences on both sides of the street can be considered balanced. If such an index is found, it prints the index; otherwise, it prints 0.
