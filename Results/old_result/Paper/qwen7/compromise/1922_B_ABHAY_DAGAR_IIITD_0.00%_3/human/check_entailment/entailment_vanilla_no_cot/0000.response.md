Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to count the number of ways to form a triangle by considering the frequency of each stick length. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Triangle Inequality Check**: The program does not actually check if the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. It only counts the number of ways to pick sticks without ensuring they satisfy the triangle inequality conditions (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side).

2. **Overcounting**: The current approach overcounts the number of valid triangles because it does not correctly apply the triangle inequality condition. For example, if we have three sticks of the same length, the number of valid combinations should be 0 since no combination of these sticks can form a triangle.

3. **Incorrect Calculation for Pairs**: The part where it calculates pairs (`cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`) is also incorrect. This calculation does not ensure that the pairs can form a triangle with the third stick.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Use a nested loop to check all possible combinations of three sticks.
- Ensure that the selected sticks satisfy the triangle inequality condition.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                for k in range(j + 1, n):
                    if (2 ** num_list[i]) + (2 ** num_list[j]) > (2 ** num_list[k]) and \
                       (2 ** num_list[i]) + (2 ** num_list[k]) > (2 ** num_list[j]) and \
                       (2 ** num_list[j]) + (2 ** num_list[k]) > (2 ** num_list[i]):
                        res += 1
        results.append(res)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_1(t)
```

This version correctly checks all combinations of three sticks and ensures they satisfy the triangle inequality condition.
