Output State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `num_list`. All other variables (`results`, `res`, `total_count`, `cnt`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
