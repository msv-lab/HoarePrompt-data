Postcondition: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the first element of `num_list`) is present with its value incremented by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`. If `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added as a new key with a value of 1. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` remains a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the first element of `num_list`.**
