Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total_count` is 0, `results` list contains the value of `res`, which is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values; `num_of_lens` dictionary contains each unique element from the original `num_list` as keys, with their respective counts as values; `num_list` is an empty list; `cnt` has been incremented to cover all elements in `num_of_lens`; `res` is the total sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is an integer, and `res` is updated to `res` plus `cnt` times (`cnt` minus 1) times (`cnt` minus 2) divided by 6, provided that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged; `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total_count' is increased by the previous `cnt` value

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair remaining, and `res` remains unchanged if `cnt` is less than 3; otherwise, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
