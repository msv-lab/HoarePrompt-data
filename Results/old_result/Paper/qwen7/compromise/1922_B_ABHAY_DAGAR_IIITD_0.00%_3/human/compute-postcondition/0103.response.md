Postcondition: `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`; `res` is increased by either `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` or `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) * (next_cnt - 2) // 6` depending on whether `next_cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and `res` is further increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if the condition `cnt >= 2` is met.
