Output State: **`res` is updated based on the previous `cnt` value. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to its previous value plus `cnt` times (`cnt` - 1) times (`cnt` - 2) divided by 6, `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, and `cnt` is the next integer value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is less than 3, the values of `res` and `total_count` remain unchanged, and `cnt` is the next integer value from `num_of_lens.values()`; `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it.**

This means that the value of `res` is updated based on the current value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) / 6 * total_count` to its previous value. `total_count` is also increased by the previous value of `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to the next integer value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` and `total_count` remain unchanged, and `cnt` is set to the next integer value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
