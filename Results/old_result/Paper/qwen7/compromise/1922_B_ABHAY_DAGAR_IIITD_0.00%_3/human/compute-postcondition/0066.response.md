Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in num_list:`. The variables involved in this loop are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: For each iteration, `x` takes the value of the current element in `num_list`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `num_list`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
   - `x` is the first element of `num_list`.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that either has one key-value pair `{x: 1}` or the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the first element of `num_list`, after processing `x`, the next element in `num_list` becomes the new `x`.
   - The list `num_list` loses its first element, but it still needs to have at least one element for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `x` will now be the second element of `num_list`.
   - `num_list` will be the list without its first element (i.e., `num_list[1:]`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is the second element of `num_list`; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that either has one key-value pair `{x: 1}` or the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**

However, since `num_list` is modified by removing its first element, we can simplify the description of `num_list` to reflect that it still has at least one element but is now missing its first element.

Final state:
State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (excluding the first element); `x` is the second element of `num_list`; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that either has one key-value pair `{x: 1}` or the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**
