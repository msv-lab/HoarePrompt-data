Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (must not be empty), `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first element of `num_list` and now `x` is a key in `num_of_lens` with its value incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `x` (which was already a key in `num_of_lens`) has had its corresponding value in the dictionary incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
