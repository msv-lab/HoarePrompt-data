Postcondition: `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is the first element of `num_list`; if `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num_of_lens` is updated to contain the key-value pair `{x: 1}`.
