Output State: **`total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`; `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`; `res` is either increased by `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) * (next_cnt - 2) // 6` depending on whether `next_cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. The value of `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`, and the condition for updating `res` based on `next_cnt` remains unchanged. Therefore, `res` can still be updated based on `next_cnt` if it meets the condition.
