Output State: **`res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding to itself the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. The other variables `num_of_lens` and `cnt` retain their initial conditions, with `num_of_lens` having at least one key-value pair and `cnt` being greater than or equal to 3.
