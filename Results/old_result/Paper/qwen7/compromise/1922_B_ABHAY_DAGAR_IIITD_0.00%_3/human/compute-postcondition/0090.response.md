Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`. This means that `cnt` takes on each value from `num_of_lens` in turn.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, and its keys and values do not change within the loop. Therefore, `num_of_lens` itself does not need to be adjusted.
   - `cnt` is the variable that changes with each iteration, taking on each value from `num_of_lens`.
   - `res` and `total_count` are adjusted based on the value of `cnt`. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `cnt`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens` and the loop continues as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens`, the next value of `cnt` will be the next key in `num_of_lens`.
   - `total_count` is increased by `cnt` during each iteration, so it will be increased by the next value of `cnt`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `cnt` will be the next value from `num_of_lens`.
- `total_count` will be increased by the next value of `cnt`.

Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and assuming it has more than one key-value pair, the next value of `cnt` will be the next key in the dictionary.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`, `res` is unchanged, `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`**.

However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, the relevant states to adjust are:

**State: **`cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`**.
