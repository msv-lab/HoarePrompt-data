Output State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1, and `x` is an element of `num_list`.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of `num_of_lens[x]` to 1. This means that if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1 to become 1. If `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, a new entry with key `x` and value 1 is added to `num_of_lens`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
