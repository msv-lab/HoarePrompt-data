Output State: **`total_count' is increased by the previous `cnt` value**.

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by the previous value of `cnt`. The values of `res` and `cnt` remain unchanged, and `cnt` is set to the next integer value from `num_of_lens.values()`. The precondition that `res` is updated based on the previous `cnt` value and `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value remains valid.
