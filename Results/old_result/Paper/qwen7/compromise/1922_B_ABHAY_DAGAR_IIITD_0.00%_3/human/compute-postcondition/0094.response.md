Output State: **`cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is further increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Since `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens` and `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`, these values are used in the calculation. Additionally, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. The precondition that `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens` and `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt` remains valid after the code execution.
