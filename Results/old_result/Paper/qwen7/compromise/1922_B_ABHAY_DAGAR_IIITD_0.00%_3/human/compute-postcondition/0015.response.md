Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in num_list:`. This means the variable `x` is being iterated over each element in `num_list`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element of `num_list`) is present with its value incremented by 1.
   - `test_cases` remains a list of tuples.
   - `results` remains an empty list.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the second element of `num_list`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `num_list`, the variable `x` will change to the next element in `num_list`.
   - The dictionary `num_of_lens` will be updated with the new value of `x` if it exists in `num_list`.
   - The variable `_` will remain unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Given the above points, here is the state adjustment for the next iteration:

- `num_of_lens` will be updated with the next element in `num_list` if it exists.
- `x` will be the next element in `num_list`.
- `_` will remain greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element of `num_list`) is present with its value incremented by 1, `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
