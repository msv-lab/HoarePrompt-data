Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The `result` variable will change to the next element in the `results` list.
   - The `results` list itself does not change; it remains the same.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `result` changes to the next element in the `results` list, the new value of `result` will be the next element in the list.
   - The `results` list remains unchanged.

Given these points, we can conclude that the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `result`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`result` is the next element in the `results` list, `results` is the same list as before**
