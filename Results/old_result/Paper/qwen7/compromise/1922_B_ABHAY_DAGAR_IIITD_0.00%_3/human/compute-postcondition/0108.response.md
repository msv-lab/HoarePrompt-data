The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is typically an underscore used as a throwaway variable) and `test_cases`. Since the underscore is just a placeholder and does not hold any state, we only need to adjust the state of `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `results` contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, and `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, and `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**.
