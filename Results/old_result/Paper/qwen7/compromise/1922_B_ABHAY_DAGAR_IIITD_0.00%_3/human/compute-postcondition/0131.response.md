Output State: The `results` list now contains the value of `res`, which is the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop. `res` is the total sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary entries. `total_count` is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` values. `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`. `num_list` is an empty list since all elements have been processed. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique element from `num_list`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `num_list` is exhausted, and `num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer that appeared in `num_list`. The `results` and `res` reflect the cumulative sum of these frequencies, and `total_count` is the sum of all these frequencies.
