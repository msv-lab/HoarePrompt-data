Postcondition: `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair remaining, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3; otherwise, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and `total_count` and `res` remain unchanged if `cnt` is less than 2.
