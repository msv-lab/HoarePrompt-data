Output State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element from `num_list` is a key, and the corresponding value for each key is the count of how many times that element appeared in `num_list`. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` becomes an empty list after all elements have been processed, `n` is an input integer, and `_` must be greater than 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain a count of each distinct number that appeared in `num_list`, with the counts reflecting how often each number appeared. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `n`, and `_`) will retain their states from the final iteration of the loop, with `num_list` being empty since all elements have been processed.
