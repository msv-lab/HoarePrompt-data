Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in num_list:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num_list` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
   - `x` is the variable that will take each element from `num_list` in each iteration.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `num_list` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `num_list`.
   - The value of `x` will change in each iteration, starting from the first element of `num_list`.

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - We know that `num_list` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num_list` must have at least one element.
   - Since `x` will take the value of the first element in `num_list` in the first iteration, we need to ensure that `x` is set to the first element of `num_list`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num_list` must have at least one element.
- `x` must be set to the first element of `num_list`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary**.
