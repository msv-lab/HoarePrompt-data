Output State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The line `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of `num_of_lens` at index `x` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
