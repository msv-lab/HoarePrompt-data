Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is `ar[6]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 6**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to `ar[i]`, where `i` is 6. Therefore, `num` is now the 7th element in the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.
