Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the array a is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of the list `ar` in the if part, or `minn` is neither infinity nor equal to the length of `ar` in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `same` is between 1 and len(ar)-1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is equal to len(ar), and `minn` is either infinity, the length of `ar`, or a value that is the minimum of its current value and `same`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `same` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` starting from `ar[0]` up to the last element processed, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is the current number being tracked, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop's execution, and `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations and moved past the last index of the list. `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the current value of `same`, and `minn` is either equal to infinity or the length of the list `ar` in the if part, or `minn` is neither infinity nor the length of the list `ar` in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
