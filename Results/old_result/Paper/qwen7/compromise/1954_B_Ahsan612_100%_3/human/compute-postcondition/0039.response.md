Output State: `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, and `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is now equal to the length of the list `ar`, indicating that every element in the list has been processed. The variable `minn` holds the minimum value between the initial comparison values (`ar[1]` and `ar[2]`) and any subsequent updates based on the value of `same`. The variable `same` reflects the count of consecutive occurrences of the current `num` before it changes to the next element in the list.
