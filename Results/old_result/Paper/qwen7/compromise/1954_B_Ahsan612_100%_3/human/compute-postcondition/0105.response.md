Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is now equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 2, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `same` was initially set to 1. After executing `same += 1`, `same` is incremented by 1, making its new value 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
