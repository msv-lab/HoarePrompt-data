Postcondition: `same` is either 3 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is 2, `i` is 6 if the condition `ar[i] == num` is false, otherwise `same` is 3 and `i` remains 5.
