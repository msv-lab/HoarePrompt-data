Output State: **`same` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
