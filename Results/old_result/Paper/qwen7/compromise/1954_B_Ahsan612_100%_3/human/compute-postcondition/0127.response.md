Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, `i` is set to a value such that `i + 2 < len(ar)`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code sets `same` to 1. This updates the value of `same` from its initial state, which was an integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
