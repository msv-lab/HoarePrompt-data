Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. No other changes are made to the other variables (`t`, `n`, or `ar`). Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
