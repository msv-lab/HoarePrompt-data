Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` equals `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
