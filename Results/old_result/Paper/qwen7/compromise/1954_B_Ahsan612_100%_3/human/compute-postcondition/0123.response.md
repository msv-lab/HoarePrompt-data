Output State: **`same` is an integer + 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is set to a value such that `i + 1 < len(ar)`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
