Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `len(ar)` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `same = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. None of the other variables (`minn`, `i`, `num`, or `len(ar)`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
