Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
