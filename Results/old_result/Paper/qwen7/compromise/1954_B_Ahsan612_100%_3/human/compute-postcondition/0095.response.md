Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `same` is between 1 and `len(ar) - 1`
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers
- `num` is the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists
- `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, and it is either infinity, the length of `ar`, or a value that is the minimum of its current value and `same`
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`

### Loop Head:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder and does not hold any meaningful state.
- The loop runs for a number of iterations specified by `int(input())`.

### Adjusting States:
- Since the loop runs for a number of iterations based on user input, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations left to run.
- The initial state of `i` (which is set to `len(ar)`) will be decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

### New State:
- After one more iteration of the loop, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `len(ar) - 1`.
- The other states (`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop itself.

### Final State:
State: **`same` is between 1 and len(ar) - 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, and `i` is equal to len(ar) - 1.**
