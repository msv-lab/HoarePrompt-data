Postcondition: `same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, and `ar[2]` equals `num`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `ar[i]` (where `i` is 1) equals `num`, then `same` becomes 2, `i` changes to 2, and `minn` is updated to the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`. If the condition is not met, `same` remains 1, `minn` is set to 1, `i` changes to 3, `num` is updated to `ar[3]`, and `ar[2]` does not equal `num`.
