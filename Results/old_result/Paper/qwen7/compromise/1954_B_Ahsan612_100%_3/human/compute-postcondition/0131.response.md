Output State: `same` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` starting from `ar[0]` up to the last element processed, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is the current number being tracked, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop's execution, and `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations. `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.

This means that after the loop completes, `same` will hold the smallest number of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` starting from the first element. The other variables retain their final values as described, with `i` pointing just beyond the end of the list.
