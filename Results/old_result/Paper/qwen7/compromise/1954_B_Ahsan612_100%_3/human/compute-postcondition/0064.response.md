Postcondition: `same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, and `ar[3]` is equal to `num`. If `ar[i]` (where `i` is 3) is equal to `num`, then `same` becomes 2 and `i` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `same` remains 1, `minn` is set to 1, `i` is updated to 4, and `ar[4]` is equal to `num`.
