Output State: **`same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
