Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list of n integers a (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. Based on these inputs, the function determines if the array a meets certain criteria and returns a result accordingly.**

Note: The actual logic to determine if the array is beautiful and what the return value should be based on that determination is not specified in the given information.
