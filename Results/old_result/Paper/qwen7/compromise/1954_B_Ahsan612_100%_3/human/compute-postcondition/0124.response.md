The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is set to a value such that `i + 1 < len(ar)`. After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be one more than its original value, but it still satisfies the condition `i + 1 < len(ar)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is set to a value such that `i + 2 < len(ar)`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**
