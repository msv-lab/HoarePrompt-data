Output State: `same` is between 1 and len(ar)-1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `same` will hold the count of consecutive occurrences of the current `num` before it changes to a new value. The variable `minn` will store the minimum value of `same` encountered throughout the loop's execution. The value of `num` will be the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists.
