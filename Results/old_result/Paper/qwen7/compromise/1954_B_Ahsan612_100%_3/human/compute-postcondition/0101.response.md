Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is now equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `i = 1` simply assigns the integer value 1 to the variable `i`. No other variables are affected, so their previous values remain unchanged.
