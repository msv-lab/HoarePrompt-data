Postcondition: `same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, and `ar[2]` equals `num`.

Explanation: 
- If `ar[i] == num` (with `i` initially set to 1), then `same` becomes 2, `i` is updated to 2, and `num` remains as the first element of `ar`. Additionally, `minn` is updated to the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`.
- If the condition `ar[i] == num` is false, then `same` remains 1, `minn` is set to 1, `i` is updated to 3, `num` is set to `ar[3]`, and `len(ar)` is confirmed to be greater than 1. However, since the original precondition states `len(ar) > 1`, this case does not change the length of the list.
