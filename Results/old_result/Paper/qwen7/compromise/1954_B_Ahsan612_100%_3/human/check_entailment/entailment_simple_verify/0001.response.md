### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of elements `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive identical elements and `num` to track the current element.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements (`minn`).

3. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The loop correctly identifies sequences of identical elements.
   - `minn` is updated to store the minimum length of such sequences.
   - If `minn` is infinite (`inf`) or equals the length of the array, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for identifying the minimum sequence length is correct.
   - The handling of edge cases (like when the array is already uniform) is appropriate.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The program only considers the minimum length of consecutive identical elements but does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty property by removing elements strategically.

5. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The minimum length of consecutive identical elements is `1` (for both `1`s and `2`s). The program would print `1` as the answer, which is incorrect because removing one `1` or one `2` would not make the array non-beautiful.
   - Similarly, for the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is `3` (for `3`s). The program would print `3`, which is also incorrect because removing three `3`s would not break the beauty property.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the longest sequence of identical elements and remove elements from other sequences to break the beauty property.
   - We should keep track of the longest sequence of identical elements and ensure that the remaining elements do not form a new beautiful sequence.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly handle the requirement to break the beauty property by removing elements strategically. The provided program only considers the minimum length of consecutive identical elements, which is insufficient to determine the correct minimum number of elements to remove.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
