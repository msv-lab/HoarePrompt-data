### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of elements `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive identical elements and `num` to track the current element.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements (`minn`).

3. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The loop correctly identifies sequences of identical elements.
   - `minn` is updated to store the minimum length of such sequences.
   - If `minn` is infinite (`inf`) or equals the length of the array, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for identifying the minimum sequence length is correct.
   - The handling of edge cases (like when the array is already uniform) is appropriate.
   - The final check to ensure the array cannot be made non-beautiful if `minn` is infinite or equal to the array length is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
