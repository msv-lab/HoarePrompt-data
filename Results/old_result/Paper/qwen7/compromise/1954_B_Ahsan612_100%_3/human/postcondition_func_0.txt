The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers. It then finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list. If such a minimum count exists and is less than the length of the list, it prints this minimum count; otherwise, it prints -1. The function implicitly accepts the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case through standard input and does not return any value explicitly.
