Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1()` correctly initializes the necessary variables (`n`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`, `cnt`, and `ans`).
2. The loop to check if the array is beautiful is implemented correctly. If any two consecutive elements are different, `flag` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks.
3. The logic to calculate the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the array is also correct. It iterates through the array, counting consecutive occurrences and updating `ans` accordingly.
4. The conditional statements to handle the output based on the value of `flag` are correct. If `flag` is `True`, `-1` is printed, indicating the array is already beautiful. Otherwise, `ans` is printed, which is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the array.
5. The overall structure of the function aligns with the problem requirements and handles all specified constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
