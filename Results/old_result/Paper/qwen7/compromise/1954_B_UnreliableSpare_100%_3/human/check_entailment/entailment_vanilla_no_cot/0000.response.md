Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called within the main loop where the test cases are processed. The main loop should call `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Logic for Determining Minimum Removals**: The logic to determine the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. Specifically:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if the array is already non-beautiful (i.e., there is at least one position where `arr[i] != arr[i-1]`), it should just print `-1`. This is incorrect because even a non-beautiful array might still need some elements removed to stop being beautiful.
   - The logic for counting consecutive elements that are the same and determining the minimum removals is also incorrect. It does not properly account for the requirement to remove elements to break the beauty condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-beautiful
        if any(arr[i] != arr[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)):
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the longest segment of consecutive identical elements
        max_length = 0
        current_length = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
                current_length = 1
        
        # Print the result
        print(n - max_length)
```

This corrected version:
- Checks if the array is already non-beautiful and prints `-1` if it is.
- Finds the longest segment of consecutive identical elements.
- Prints the number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty condition, which is the total length of the array minus the length of the longest segment of identical elements.
