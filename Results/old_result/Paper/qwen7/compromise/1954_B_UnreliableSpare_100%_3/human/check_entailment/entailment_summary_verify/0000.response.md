### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to understand why.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
- A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the array.
   - If the array is beautiful, it prints `-1`.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - The program uses a flag to check if the array is already beautiful.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it iterates through the array to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element, which indirectly helps in determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It determines if the list `a` is "beautiful".
   - If the list is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list and prints this value.
   - If the list is beautiful, it prints `-1`.

#### Correctness of the Given Program:
- The program correctly identifies if the array is beautiful by checking adjacent elements.
- For non-beautiful arrays, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element, which effectively helps in determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
- The logic in the program is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Example Verification:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  5
  1 2 1 2 1
  ```
  - The array is not beautiful.
  - The program correctly identifies that removing the middle `2` will break the beauty condition.
  - The output is `1`, which is correct.

- Consider another input:
  ```
  7
  3 3 3 5 3 3 3
  ```
  - The array is not beautiful.
  - The program correctly identifies that removing the first three elements will break the beauty condition.
  - The output is `3`, which is correct.

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.
