Output State: **`val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity').**

Explanation: The code initializes `val` to the first element of the list `arr` (`arr[0]`) and sets `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
