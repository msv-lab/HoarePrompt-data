The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the diagonally opposite corners and prints the smaller distance. The function outputs a series of numbers, one for each test case, representing the minimum distance calculated for each set of input coordinates.
