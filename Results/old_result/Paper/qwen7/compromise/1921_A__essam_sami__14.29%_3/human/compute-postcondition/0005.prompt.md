You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case has four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. These coordinates represent the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are at most 100 test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed by the `print` statements inside the loop. For each iteration of the loop, the program calculates two distances `n` and `x`, and prints the smaller one. Therefore, the output will contain `t` numbers, where `t` is the number of test cases, and each number is the minimum distance calculated for each set of inputs provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four lines with two integers per line representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns information about the squares based on the given coordinates.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
