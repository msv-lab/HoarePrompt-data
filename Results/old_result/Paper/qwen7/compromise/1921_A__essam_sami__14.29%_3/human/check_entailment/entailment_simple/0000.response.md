Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the area of a square by finding the smallest distance between pairs of points, which is not the correct approach. The program should instead identify the side length of the square by comparing the differences between the coordinates of the points.

Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the squared Euclidean distance between pairs of points (e.g., \(n\) and \(x\)) and prints the smaller one. This does not necessarily correspond to the side length of the square. Instead, it compares the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately.

2. **Correct Approach**: To correctly identify the side length of the square, we need to compare the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points. Specifically, we should find the maximum difference in x-coordinates and the maximum difference in y-coordinates, as these will be equal for a square with sides parallel to the axes.

3. **Implementation**: The correct implementation would involve:
   - Storing all four points.
   - Finding the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.
   - Calculating the side length of the square as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).
   - Squaring this value to get the area.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
