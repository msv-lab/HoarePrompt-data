Postcondition: `flag` is a boolean and `s` is a string. If `flag` is True, then the character at index `i` of string `s` is no longer '1'. Otherwise, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1' and the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `s`.
