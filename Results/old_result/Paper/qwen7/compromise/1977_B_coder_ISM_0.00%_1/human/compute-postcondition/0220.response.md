Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(30)`. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 30`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

5. **Verify Other Variables**: The other variables (`length`, `nalla`, `x`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body. Since no modifications to these variables are specified in the problem, they retain their current values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 33, `x` is an input integer, and if `x & pow(2, i)` is greater than 0, then `s` is `['1']`; otherwise, `s` is `['0']`**.
