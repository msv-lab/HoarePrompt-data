Postcondition: `i` is 1, `flag` is a boolean, `s` is a string such that if `flag` is True, the character at index 1 of `s` is '1', otherwise the character at index 1 of `s` is '0'. If `flag` is 0 and the character at index 1 of `s` is the same as the character at index 2 of `s` and the character at index 1 of `s` is '1', then the character at index 1 of `s` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, the character at index 1 of `s` remains unchanged.
