Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a list of three elements where the first two elements are '1' or '0' and the third element is either '1' or '0'. `t` is increased by 1, and `x` is an input integer. If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, then the first element of `s` is '1'. Otherwise, the first element of `s` is '0'.**
