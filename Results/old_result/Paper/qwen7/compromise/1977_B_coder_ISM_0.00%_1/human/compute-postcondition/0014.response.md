Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with '1' appended to it, `i` is 30**

The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `x` remains an input integer, and `i` is still 30. The list `s` now contains the element `'1'` in addition to whatever elements it had before.
