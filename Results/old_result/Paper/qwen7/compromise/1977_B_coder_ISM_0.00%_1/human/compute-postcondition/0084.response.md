Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]`, for all `i` from 2 to 28, `s[i]` is '0', `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1'**.

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, the list `s` contains elements from index 0 to 29, with `s[0]` being either '0' or '1', `s[1]` equal to `s[0]`, and all other elements from index 2 to 29 being '0', and `s[29]` is '0'. After appending `'1'` to the list, the length of `s` increases by one, and the new element at index 30 is `'1'`. All other values of the variables remain unchanged.
