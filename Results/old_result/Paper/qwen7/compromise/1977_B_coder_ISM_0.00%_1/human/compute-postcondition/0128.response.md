Postcondition: `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s` is either `['1', '1', '1']`, `['0', '1', '1']`, `['1', '0', '1']`, or `['0', '0', '1']`, `t` is increased by 1, and `x` is an input integer. If `x` has the bit at position `i` (which is 2) set to 1, then `s` remains unchanged and `t` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `s` is set to `['1', '1', '0']`, `['0', '1', '0']`, `['1', '0', '0']`, or `['0', '0', '0']` depending on the original value of `s`, and `t` is increased by 1.
