Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 3, `length` is at least 29, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is '-1', `s[1]` is '1', `s[2]` is '0', for all `i` from 3 to 28, `s[i]` is '0', `s[29]` is '1', and `s[30]` is '1'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 3 because the loop increments `i` starting from 1 and continues until it can no longer find a pair where `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1'. Given the initial conditions and the output state after 3 iterations, we know that the only change made by the loop was setting `s[1]` to '-1' and `s[2]` to '0' during the second iteration. Since no further changes were made in subsequent iterations, the final state remains with `i` as 3, `length` being at least 29, `flag` unchanged, and the specified values for `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 32, length is greater than 31, and the value of s[31] is either '0' or '-1', while all elements s[0] to s[30] remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 30, flag is 1, and the string s has been modified according to the given rules.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
