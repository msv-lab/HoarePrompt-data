Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` must be greater than 1, `s[i]` is '0', `s[i - 1]` is '-1'**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `s[i - 1]` from '1' to '-1'. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `length` is still greater than 1, `s[i]` is still '0', and `s[i - 1]` is now '-1'.
