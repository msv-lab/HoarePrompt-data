Output State: **`i` is 29; `flag` remains unchanged; `s` is a list where the 29th element is '1'; `length` is increased by 1.**

The code `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. Since `i` and `flag` remain unchanged, and `s` is a list where the 29th element is '1', these values stay the same. Therefore, the updated state includes `length` being increased by 1.
