Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `length > 30`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 30.
   - `length` is greater than 30.
   - If `s[29]` is '-1' and `s[28]` is '1', then no changes are made to the variables.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < length`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 30 and `length` is greater than 30, the loop will execute again if `i` is incremented to 31.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `i` will become 31.
   - `length` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body and the condition for continuing the loop does not depend on modifying `length`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now 31.
   - `length` must still be greater than 30 (since it was greater than 30 at the end of the previous iteration and no changes were made).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 31, `length` is greater than 30**.
