Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with '1' or '0' appended to it, and `i` is 30. If `x` has the bit at position `i` set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true), then `s` is a list with '1' appended to it. Otherwise, `s` is a list with '1' and '0' appended to it.
