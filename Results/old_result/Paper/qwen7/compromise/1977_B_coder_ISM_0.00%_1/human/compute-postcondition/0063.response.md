Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is 0, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]`, `s[2]` is '1'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `flag`. The values of `i`, `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and `s[2]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `flag` is now 0, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` remains equal to `s[0]`, and `s[2]` is still '1'.
