Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` must be at least 29, `s[2]` is '0', `s[1]` is '-1', `flag` is either 0 or 1**

Explanation: The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the string `s` such that the character at index `i - 1` (which is `1` since `i` is `2`) is set to `'-'` followed by `1`. Therefore, `s[1]` is now `'-'` followed by `1`, which is `'-'1`. However, since strings are typically represented without the number following the `-`, we represent it as `'-'1` or simply `'-'` followed by `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
