Postcondition: `i` is 1, `flag` is a boolean, `s` is a string such that if `flag` is True, the character at index 1 of `s` is '1', otherwise the character at index 1 of `s` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, `s[i]` (which is `s[1]`) is changed to '-1'. Otherwise, the character at index 1 of `s` remains as specified by the value of `flag`.
