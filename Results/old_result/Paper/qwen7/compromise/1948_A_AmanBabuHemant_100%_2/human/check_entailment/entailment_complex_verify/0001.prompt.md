You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` input integers between 1 and 50, inclusive; for each integer `n`, if `n` is odd, the output is 'NO'; if `n` is even and the length of 'AAB' * (n // 2) is less than 200, the output is 'YES' followed by the string 'AAB' * (n // 2); otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of integer inputs `t` and `n`. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and the generated string 'AAB' repeated `(n // 2)` times is less than 200 characters long, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Count Check:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters with an odd count (as explained in the problem statement).
     - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct a string.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The program constructs a string `s` using the pattern `'AAB' * (n // 2)`.
     - This pattern ensures that every third character is different from its neighbors, making the characters at positions 1, 4, 7, etc., special.
     - For example, for `n = 6`, the string would be `"AAB AAB"` which simplifies to `"AAABAA"`. Here, the special characters are at positions 1, 4, and 6.
     - This pattern guarantees that the constructed string will have exactly `n // 2` special characters.

4. **Output Validation:**
   - The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200.
     - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.
     - If the length exceeds 200, it prints "NO".

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1: n = 6**
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     YES
     AAABAA
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     YES
     AAABAA
     ```

2. **Test Case 2: n = 1**
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     NO
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     NO
     ```

3. **Test Case 3: n = 2**
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     YES
     MM
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     YES
     MM
     ```

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the example. It correctly identifies when a solution is not possible (odd `n`) and constructs a valid string with the required number of special characters for even `n`.
