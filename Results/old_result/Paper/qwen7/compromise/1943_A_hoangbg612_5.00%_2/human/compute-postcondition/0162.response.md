Output State: `cur` is the last element in the list `N`, `i` is 2, and `M` is a dictionary where keys are elements from the list `N` that are greater than `cur` and their values are 1, while `-1` has a value equal to the count of elements in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be set to the largest element in the list `N` that satisfies the conditions within the loop. The variable `i` remains 2 because the loop breaks after the first iteration when `num > cur`. The dictionary `M` will contain entries for each unique element in `N` that is greater than `cur`, with each entry's value being 1. Additionally, the key `-1` in `M` will have a value equal to the count of elements in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur`.
