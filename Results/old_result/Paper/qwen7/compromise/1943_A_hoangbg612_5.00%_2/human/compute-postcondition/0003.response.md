Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `N`. The initial state values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged.
