Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves `num` from the list `N`.

2. **Understand the conditions and updates**:
   - `cur` is either -1 or equal to `num` if `num > cur`.
   - If `cur` was -1, it is now updated to `next_num`.
   - If `cur` was equal to `num`, it remains unchanged.
   - `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive.
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`.
   - `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated, or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since `num` is being iterated over from the list `N`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `cur`.
   - `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Consider the possible values of `cur`**:
   - If `cur` was -1, it is now updated to `next_num`.
   - If `cur` was equal to `num`, it remains unchanged.

5. **Prepare the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
   - `cur` will be updated based on the condition described above.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the update of `cur` to the next element in the list `N`.

**State:**
- `cur` is either -1 or equal to the next element in `N` (let's call it `next_num`).
- `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`.
- `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated, or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated.

Since `cur` is the only variable that changes within the loop head, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cur` is either -1 or equal to the next element in `N`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated, or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated.**
