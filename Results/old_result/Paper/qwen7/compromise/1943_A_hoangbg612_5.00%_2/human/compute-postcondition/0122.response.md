Based on the initial state provided, `cur` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. Since the loop did not break early because `M[i]` was less than or equal to `i` for any `i` from 0 to 2, it implies that `cur` remained unchanged from its initial value. Therefore, `cur` must still be greater than 0.

Output: **cur (where cur is a value greater than 0)**
