Postcondition: `cur` is either -1 or equal to the next element in `N`. `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M[cur]` is 2 if `cur` was updated (either to `num` or to the next element in `N`), or `M[next_num]` is 2 if `cur` was -1 and updated.
