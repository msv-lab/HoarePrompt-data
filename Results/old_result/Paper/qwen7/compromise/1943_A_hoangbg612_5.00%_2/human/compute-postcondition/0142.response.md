Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `N` to iterate over.

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**:
   - `cur` is either equal to `num` and `i` is 2, or
   - `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`.

4. **Consider the possible states at the start of the next iteration**:
   - If `cur` is equal to `num` and `i` is 2, then the current `num` was the value that made `cur` equal to `num`. For the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in `N`.
   - If `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, then the loop might have started with an initial condition where `cur` is -1 and `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `num` will be the first element in `N`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - In both cases, the variable `num` will change to the next element in `N`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next `num` from the list `N`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is either equal to the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`.**
