Postcondition: `cur` is either -1 or equal to `num`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, and if `num > cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1, and `M` contains a key-value pair where the key is -1 and the value is 1.
