Output State: **`cur` is either -1 or equal to the next element in `N` + 1, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated, or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. If `cur` was -1 before the increment, it now equals the next element in `N`. Otherwise, `cur` is now equal to its previous value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
