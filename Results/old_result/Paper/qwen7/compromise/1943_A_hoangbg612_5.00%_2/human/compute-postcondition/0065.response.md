Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is 0 (or a negative value), `S` is an input integer, `N` is now sorted in ascending order, and `M` maps each relevant element to its frequency in `N`.**

Explanation: The line `cur = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cur`. All other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `M`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
