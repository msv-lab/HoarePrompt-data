Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is a variable that will take on the values from the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `N` must contain at least one element. If `N` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - Since `N` is a list and the loop will iterate over its elements, we need to ensure that `N` contains at least one element.
   - The value of `num` will change with each iteration, but initially, it doesn't matter what `num` is because the loop will start with the first element of `N`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `N` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` must be a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M` is an empty dictionary**
