Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `N` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is equal to the third element of `N`.
   - `M[cur]` is set to 1 if `num` is greater than `cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `num` is the variable being iterated over, it will be incremented to the next element in the list `N`.
   - `cur` will now be the fourth element of `N` (since `num` was the third element).
   - `M[cur]` will be updated based on the new value of `num`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `num` will be the fourth element of `N`.
   - `cur` will be the fourth element of `N` (since `num` was the third element).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cur` is the fourth element of `N`, `M[cur]` is set to 1 if `num` is greater than `cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is incremented by 1**.
