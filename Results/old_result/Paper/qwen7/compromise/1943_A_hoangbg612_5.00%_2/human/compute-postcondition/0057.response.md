Output State: **`M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i`, the index `cur` is within the bounds of `M`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `M` or `cur`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the code snippet, we assume it refers to the most internal loop or conditional context. The values of `M` and `cur` remain unchanged, and the condition that `cur` is equal to `i` and within the bounds of `M` still holds true.
