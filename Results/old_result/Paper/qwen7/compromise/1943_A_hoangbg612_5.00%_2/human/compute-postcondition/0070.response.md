Output State: **`cur` is the current value of `cur` plus 1, the current value of `num` is greater than the new value of `cur`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The initial condition states that `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. After the increment, `cur` becomes `cur + 1`, and the condition about `num` remains true because `num` was already greater than `cur + 1`, so it is now greater than the new value of `cur`.
