Output State: **`cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer**

Explanation: The variable `S` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value entered by the user. The values of `cur`, `i`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial states.
