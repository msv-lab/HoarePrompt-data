Output State: **`cur` is either equal to the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `2`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Initially, `cur` is either equal to the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`. In both cases, `cur` is -1, so the dictionary `M` will have its value for key `-1` incremented from `1` to `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
