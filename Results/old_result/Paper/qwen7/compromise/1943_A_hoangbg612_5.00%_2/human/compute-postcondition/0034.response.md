Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated, or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` updates the variable `cur` to be equal to the value of `num`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Since `cur` was either -1 or equal to the next element in `N`, and now it is equal to `num`, the condition for updating the dictionary `M` remains the same. Therefore, `M` will contain the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated (now it is equal to `num`), or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated.
