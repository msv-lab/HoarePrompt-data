Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4 remains valid, and no other variables are affected.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    for i in range(cur):
        if M[i] <= i:
            cur = i
            break
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final value of `cur` is the last index `i` for which the condition `M[i] <= i` was satisfied before breaking out of the loop. `T` and `S` remain as initially provided, `N` is still empty, and `M` maps each relevant element to its frequency in `N` with the sum of the counts equaling the initial value of `S` if the condition in the if statement was true for some iteration. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged, `T` and `S` stay as initially provided, `N` is empty, and `M` maps each relevant element to its frequency in `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 2.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `cur` remains greater than 0, and the value of `i` is 2. This implies that the loop did not break early because `M[i]` was less than or equal to `i` for any `i` from 0 to 2, and thus `cur` remained unchanged from its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cur is greater than 3, i is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
