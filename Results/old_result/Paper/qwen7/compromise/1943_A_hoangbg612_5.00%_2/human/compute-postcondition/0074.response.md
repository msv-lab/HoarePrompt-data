Output State: **`num` is greater than `cur + 1`; `cur` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. This means that `cur` now holds the value of `num`. The condition that `num` is greater than `cur + 1` is no longer checked because `cur` has been updated to `num`. Therefore, the only change is that `cur` is now equal to `num`, and the original condition remains as a precondition.
