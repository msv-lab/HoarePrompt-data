Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cur`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `cur - 1`. This means `i` starts from `0` and increments until it reaches `cur`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `M` is a list of integers.
   - `cur` is equal to `i` (from the previous iteration).
   - The index `i` is within the bounds of `M`.
   - If the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop breaks.

4. **Consider the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `cur`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by `1` to become `cur + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `cur + 1`.
   - The value of `cur` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since there is no explicit modification given, `cur` stays the same.

6. **Ensure the loop condition is met**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < cur`. After the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `cur`, so for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `cur`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is now `cur + 1`.
- `cur` remains the same.
- `M` is still a list of integers.
- The index `i` must still be within the bounds of `M`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i` (which is now `cur + 1`), the index `i` (now `cur + 1`) is within the bounds of `M`.**
