Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, processes pairs of integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). The function does not return a value explicitly from the given code snippet, but it implies processing each test case and potentially returning results for each case.**

However, since the exact return values or processing logic are not specified in the provided output descriptions, the functionality focuses on the input structure and implied processing rather than specific outputs.
