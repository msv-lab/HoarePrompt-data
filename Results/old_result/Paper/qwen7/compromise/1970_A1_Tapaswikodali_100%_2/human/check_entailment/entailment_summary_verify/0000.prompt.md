You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", calculates the balance of parentheses at each position, sorts the characters in `s` based on their balance and position, and prints a new string composed of these characters. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, its length `n`, a sorted list of `BalanceInfo` objects, and a printed string `result` composed of characters from `s` based on the sorting rules.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the sorting of the balance information correctly. The sorting key should prioritize non-negative balances first and then sort by position in descending order within the same balance level. However, the current implementation sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order, which does not guarantee that prefixes will have non-negative balances.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The expected balanced shuffle is `()(()())`, but the current implementation might produce an incorrect sequence due to the sorting logic. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. **Compute Balance Information:**
   ```
   Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
   Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
   Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
   ```

2. **Sort by Balance and Position:**
   The current implementation sorts by `(balance, -position)`, which means it prioritizes negative balances over positive ones and sorts positions in descending order within the same balance level. This can lead to incorrect sequences.

3. **Expected Sorted Table:**
   ```
   Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
   Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
   Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
   ```

4. **Resulting Sequence:**
   The resulting sequence from the current implementation might not maintain the required non-negative balance property for prefixes.

To fix this, the sorting key should be adjusted to prioritize non-negative balances and then sort by position in descending order within the same balance level. Here’s a corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (max(x.balance, 0), -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)

class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
```

This corrected version ensures that the balance property is always non-negative and maintains the required order for correct balanced shuffles.
