Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to implement a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle operation involves creating a table of prefix balances, sorting the characters based on these balances, and then forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Analyze the Given Code**:
   - **Class Definition**: A class `BalanceInfo` is defined to store the balance, position, and character of each position in the input sequence.
   - **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
     - The length of the input string `s` is calculated and stored in `n`.
     - A list `balance_info` is initialized to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - A loop iterates over each character in `s`, updating the balance and storing the current balance, position, and character in `balance_info`.
     - After collecting all the information, `balance_info` is sorted based on the balance and position.
     - Finally, the characters from the sorted `balance_info` are joined to form the result string, which is then printed.
   - **Helper Function (`func_1`)**:
     - This function is not used in the provided code and seems to be a placeholder or might be intended for a different purpose. However, it is not necessary for the implementation of the balanced shuffle operation as described.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the prefix balance and storing it in `balance_info` is correct.
   - Sorting `balance_info` based on the balance and position ensures that the characters are placed in the correct order for the balanced shuffle operation.
   - Joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` to form the result string is the correct final step.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
