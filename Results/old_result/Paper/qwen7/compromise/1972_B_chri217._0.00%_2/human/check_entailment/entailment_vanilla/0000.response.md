Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins.
2. The provided solution reads all inputs at once and processes them in a loop.
3. The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
4. The logic in `func_1` checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd. If it is, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
5. This logic aligns with the problem statement, which states that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win, and if even, Bob will win.
6. The provided examples match the expected behavior of the function:
   - For `"UUDUD"`, there are 3 facing-up coins, so `num_up % 2 == 1` is true, and the function returns `'YES'`.
   - For `"UDDUD"`, there are 2 facing-up coins, so `num_up % 2 == 0` is true, and the function returns `'NO'`.
   - For `"UU"`, there are 2 facing-up coins, so `num_up % 2 == 0` is true, and the function returns `'NO'`.

Given that the logic in the provided code correctly implements the rules described in the problem statement and matches the provided examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
