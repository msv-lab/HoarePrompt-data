### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all inputs at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the data into a list. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: The program iterates over each test case by reading the necessary parameters (`n` and `s`) and calling the function `func_1` with the string `s`.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function counts the number of 'U' (up-facing) coins in the string `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is odd, the function returns 'YES', indicating that Alice will win.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is even, the function returns 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.
4. **Game Logic**:
   - The game logic described in the problem statement involves removing a 'U' coin and flipping its adjacent coins. However, the function `func_1` does not simulate the game; it only checks the initial condition of the number of 'U' coins.
   - The key insight from the game logic is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of 'U' coins determines the winner. If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always make the last move. If it is even, Bob wins because he can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that the number of 'U' coins remains even until the end.

Given that the function correctly implements the rule derived from the game logic, the program is correct.
