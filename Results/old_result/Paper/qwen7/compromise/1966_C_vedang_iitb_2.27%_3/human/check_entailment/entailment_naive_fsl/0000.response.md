Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be related to determining the winner of the game. Instead, they appear to be processing the input array in ways that do not align with the game rules.

To determine the winner, we need to use the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles. If the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def game_winner(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        xor_result = 0
        for pile_size in a:
            xor_result ^= pile_size
        
        if xor_result != 0:
            print("Alice")
        else:
            print("Bob")

# Example usage
t = 7
input_data = [
    "5",
    "3 3 3 3 3",
    "2",
    "1 7",
    "7",
    "1 3 9 7 4 2 100",
    "3",
    "1 2 3",
    "6",
    "2 1 3 4 2 4",
    "8",
    "5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2",
    "1",
    "1000000000"
]

game_winner(t)
```

This corrected version correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the XOR of the pile sizes. Since the provided program does not implement this logic, it is incorrect.
