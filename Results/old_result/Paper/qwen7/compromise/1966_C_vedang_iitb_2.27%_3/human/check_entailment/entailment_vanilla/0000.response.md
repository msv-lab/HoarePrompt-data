### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones.
   - Players take turns removing a number `k` of stones from each non-empty pile, where `k` is at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty) loses.
   - We need to determine the winner assuming optimal play.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of the sizes of the piles).
   - If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.
   - If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a)**: This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and calculates the difference between consecutive elements. This is not directly related to solving the Nim game.
   - **func_2(a, n)**: This function is intended to solve the problem recursively but does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the Nim-sum.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To determine the winner, we should calculate the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
   - If the Nim-sum is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We need to implement a function that computes the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on this value.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
