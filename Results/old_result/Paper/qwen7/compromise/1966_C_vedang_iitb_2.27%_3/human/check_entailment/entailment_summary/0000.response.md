Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of stone piles. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the optimal strategy and how the game progresses.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a list of integers `a` and returns a new sorted list `a_new` with unique elements.
   - Each element in `a_new` represents the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted and unique version of `a`.
   - The purpose of this function seems to be to transform the input list into a form that might help in determining the game's outcome.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - This function recursively determines if the first player has a winning strategy.
   - For \( n = 1 \), the first player always wins.
   - For \( n = 2 \), if the first pile has an even number of stones, the first player wins; otherwise, the second player wins.
   - For \( n > 2 \), it checks if the first player can force a win by considering the result of the game with one less pile and the parity of the first pile.

4. **Integration and Correctness**:
   - The main program processes each test case by calling `func_1` to transform the input list and then `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The transformation done by `func_1` simplifies the input list, making it easier to analyze the game state.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls to determine the winner based on the game rules.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples match the expected outcomes, indicating that the functions work as intended.
   - The transformations and recursive checks in `func_2` align with the game's rules and the optimal strategy.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. All functions together meet the requirements and produce the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
