Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - The game is about removing a positive integer \(k\) from each non-empty pile, where \(k\) is at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty) loses.
   - The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero, the position is losing; otherwise, it is winning.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code structure suggests that `func_1` and `func_2` are meant to process the input and determine the winner.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` does not align with the Nim-sum strategy required to solve the game correctly.

3. **Reviewing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This transformation does not help in determining the Nim-sum or the game state correctly.

4. **Reviewing `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` attempts to recursively determine the winner based on the parity of the number of piles and the values in the list.
   - For \(n = 1\), it returns 1 (Alice wins).
   - For \(n = 2\), it checks if the first pile has an even number of stones, returning 1 if true (Alice wins).
   - For \(n > 2\), it recursively calls itself with the remaining piles and checks conditions to decide the winner.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not consider the Nim-sum or the optimal game strategy.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To determine the winner, compute the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).
   - If the Nim-sum is zero, the current player (Bob) will lose if both play optimally.
   - Otherwise, the current player (Alice) will win.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the game logic or the Nim-sum strategy.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
