Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the median is increased to the next possible value after performing the minimum number of operations. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
2 2 8
```

The correct output should be `1`, as explained in the example. However, the program outputs `1` but does not account for the fact that the median needs to be increased to the next possible value. In this case, increasing the first element to `3` makes the array `[3, 2, 8]`, and the median becomes `3`. However, the program does not check if increasing other elements could potentially achieve the same result with fewer operations.

Another example is:

```
4
7 3 3 1
```

The correct output should be `2`, as explained in the example. However, the program outputs `2` without checking if there is a more efficient way to increase the median. For instance, increasing the third element to `4` and the fourth element to `2` results in the array `[7, 3, 4, 2]`, which has a median of `3` after sorting, and only two operations are needed.

Therefore, the program fails to handle these cases correctly, making it incorrect.
