Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is being modified within the loop.
   - `mdx`: This is a constant derived from `n` and does not change within the loop.
   - `n`: This is a constant input integer and does not change within the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, so it remains as `t - 1`.
   - `n` is a constant and does not change.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `res` is 2.
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and does not change.
   - `i` starts at `mdx + 1`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in the range `[mdx, n)`. Therefore, the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at each iteration of the loop.
   - `mdx` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `t` is already updated to `t - 1`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `res` remains 2 unless it changes inside the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume it remains 2.
   - `mdx` remains the same.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mdx + 2` (since `i` was `mdx + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is 2, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, then the value of `res` is set to 2. If `a[mdx]` does not equal `a[i]`, the value of `res` remains unchanged.**
