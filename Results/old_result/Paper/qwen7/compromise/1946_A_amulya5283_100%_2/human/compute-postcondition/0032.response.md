Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
