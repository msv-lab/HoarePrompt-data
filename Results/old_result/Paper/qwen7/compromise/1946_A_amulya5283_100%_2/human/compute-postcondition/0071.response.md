Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and `res` is `res + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `res` is updated to its original value plus one, while `n`, `mdx`, and `i` retain their initial values.
