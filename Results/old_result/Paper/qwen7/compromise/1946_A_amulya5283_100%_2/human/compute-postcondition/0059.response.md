Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any other number, it wouldn't satisfy both conditions simultaneously. So, `t = 1`.

2. `n` is described as an input integer, but its specific value is not provided. It could be any integer, but since it doesn't affect the print statement, we don't need to specify it further.

3. `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, split from a single input string. Again, the exact content of `a` is not provided, but this does not impact the print statement either.

4. The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
