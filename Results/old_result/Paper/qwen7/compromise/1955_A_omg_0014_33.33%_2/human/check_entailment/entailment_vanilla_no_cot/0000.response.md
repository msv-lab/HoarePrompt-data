Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the promotion. The logic in the program is flawed because it assumes that the cost per yogurt when buying two is half of `c`, which is incorrect. Instead, the cost for two yogurts is `c`, and we need to decide whether it's cheaper to buy in pairs or individually.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost without any promotion
        cost_without_promotion = n * a
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of pairs that can be bought
        max_pairs = n // 2
        remaining_yogurts = n % 2
        
        # Calculate the cost with promotion
        cost_with_promotion = max_pairs * b + remaining_yogurts * a
        
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_without_promotion, cost_with_promotion))

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the cost without using the promotion and the cost using the promotion, then prints the minimum of the two.
