Output State: The output state will consist of `n` lines, each containing either the value of `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d` or not for each iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input for each iteration, and `d` is calculated as `c / 2`. The comparison between `a * b` and `a * d` determines which value is printed.
