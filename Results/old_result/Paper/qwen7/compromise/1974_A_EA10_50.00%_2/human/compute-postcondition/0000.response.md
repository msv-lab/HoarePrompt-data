Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
