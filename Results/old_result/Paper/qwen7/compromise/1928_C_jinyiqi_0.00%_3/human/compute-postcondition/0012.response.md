Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing the value [3], and `output2` is a list containing the value [int(x / 3)] if `x` is divisible by 3. Otherwise, `output1` remains a list containing the value [3] and `output2` remains an empty list.
