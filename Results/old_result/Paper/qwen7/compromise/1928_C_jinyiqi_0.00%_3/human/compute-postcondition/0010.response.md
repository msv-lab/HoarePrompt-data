Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing the values [3], `output2` is a list containing the value [int(x / 3)]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(x / i)` to `output2`. Given that `i` is 3, `output2` now contains the value `[int(x / 3)]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
