You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:

            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and n are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:

    #State: Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is the largest integer such that \(i^2 \leq x\), `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\), and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients of `x` divided by each divisor in `output1` in the same order.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that is the concatenation of `output2` (list of quotients) and `output1` (list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) in descending order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list. This list contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) in descending order, followed by their corresponding quotients when `x` is divided by these divisors.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - It reads the position `n` and the number `x` for each test case.

2. **Checking Conditions for Valid `k`:**
   - The program checks two conditions to determine possible values of `k`:
     1. `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     2. `(n - x) % 2 == 0`

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It returns a list of divisors in ascending order.

4. **Generating Possible Values of `k`:**
   - For each valid condition, it uses the divisors from `func_1` to generate possible values of `k`.
   - Specifically, it checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates before converting back to a list.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` ensure that `k` is an integer and fits the pattern described in the problem.
   - These conditions are correctly applied.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
   - The logic to reverse and concatenate divisors is correct.

3. **Generating `k` Values:**
   - The logic to check if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the generated `k` values satisfy the problem constraints.
   - This part of the logic is also correct.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The final output is a unique list of valid `k` values, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find all valid `k` values based on the given constraints. There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code.
