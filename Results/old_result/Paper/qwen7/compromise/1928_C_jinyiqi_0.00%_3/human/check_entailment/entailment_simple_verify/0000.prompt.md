You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received during the settling \( x \). Specifically, the program does not handle the periodic nature of the settling pattern correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input: `10 2`

According to the problem description, the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. For \( k = 2 \), the settling pattern is:

```
k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2
```

For \( k = 3 \):

```
k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2
```

For \( k = 5 \):

```
k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2
```

For \( k = 6 \):

```
k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2
```

The program attempts to determine the number of valid \( k \) values using the functions `func_1` and some arithmetic checks, but it does not correctly account for the periodicity and the specific pattern of the settling sequence. Therefore, the program fails to provide the correct number of valid \( k \) values for the given inputs.
