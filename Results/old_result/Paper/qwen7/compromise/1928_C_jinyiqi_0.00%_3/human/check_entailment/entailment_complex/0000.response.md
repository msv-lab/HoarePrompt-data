Reasoning:

1. **Input and Variable Initialization**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It initializes variables `n` and `x` for each test case.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even. If they are, it proceeds to call `func_1` with these values.
   - The logic behind checking `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` is correct because the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, which means `n + x - 2` and `n - x` should be even for some valid `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) and their corresponding quotients.
   - The returned list is in the correct order (divisors in descending order followed by their quotients).

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - For each valid `k` found from the divisors, the program checks if \((s + 2) / 2 \geq x\). This condition ensures that the value of `k` fits the constraints given in the problem.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates before returning the result is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(k = 1\) is not considered, as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
