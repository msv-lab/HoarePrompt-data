Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of a number `x`. However, the current implementation appends `i` and `int(x / i)` to `output1` and `output2` separately, which results in duplicate values. It should directly append `i` and `int(x / i)` to the same list without reversing and concatenating them.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `sep`:**
   - The logic to calculate `sep` using `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` is flawed. These conditions do not correctly identify the possible values of `k`. Instead, we need to check if `x` falls within the range defined by the settling pattern.

3. **Divisor Check and Output Calculation:**
   - The divisor check and output calculation logic is also incorrect. Specifically, the condition `if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:` is not appropriate for determining valid `k` values.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    
    # Check divisors of (n - x + 1)
    for k in range(1, int((n - x + 1) ** 0.5) + 1):
        if (n - x + 1) % k == 0:
            if (n - x + 1) // k >= x:
                output.append(k)
            if k != (n - x + 1) // k and (n - x + 1) // k >= x:
                output.append((n - x + 1) // k)
    
    print(len(set(output)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Finding Divisors:**
   - We iterate through potential divisors of `n - x + 1` and check if they are valid `k` values.
   - If `k` is a divisor, we check if it satisfies the condition `k >= x`.
   - Similarly, if `k` is not equal to `n - x + 1 // k`, we check the other divisor and ensure it also satisfies the condition.

2. **Output Calculation:**
   - We use a set to avoid duplicate values and then count the unique valid `k` values.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
