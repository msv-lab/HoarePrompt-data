### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the provided program. Let's break down the analysis to confirm:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` of size `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `pergunta` to infinity, ensuring that any valid cost will be smaller.
   - The variable `x` accumulates the cost of moving through the queue.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `i < m`. If true, it updates `pergunta` with the minimum cost of moving to position `i`.
   - The variable `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the value of `pergunta`, which should be the minimum cost.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly accounts for the cost of moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` people.
- The backward iteration ensures that the cost of moving through the queue is calculated correctly.
- The initialization of `pergunta` to infinity ensures that the minimum cost is found.
- The condition `i < m` correctly identifies the positions where Kirill should stop moving.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
