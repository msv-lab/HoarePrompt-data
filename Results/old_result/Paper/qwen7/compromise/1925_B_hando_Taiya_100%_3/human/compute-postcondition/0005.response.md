To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans`.

1. **Variables and their ranges:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).

2. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is defined as the maximum value between any divisor `i` of `x` and `x // i` where `n` is less than or equal to either `i` or `x // i`.

Given this, let's consider the possible values for `i` and `x // i`:

- For any divisor `i` of `x`, `x // i` is also a divisor of `x`.
- We need to find the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` such that `n` is less than or equal to either `i` or `x // i`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will be the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for the appropriate divisor `i`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the maximum value between any divisor `i` of `x` and `x // i` where `n` is less than or equal to either `i` or `x // i`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value between any divisor i of x and x//i such that n is less than or equal to either i or x//i)**
