Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `isqrt(x) + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (as specified in the range function).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 1.
   - `isqrt(x) + 1` should be calculated based on the given value of `x`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
- `ans` is 0.

Since `i` is initialized to 1 and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`, we need to ensure that `isqrt(x) + 1` is correctly set.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `isqrt(x) + 1`.

**State:**
- `i` is 1.
- `isqrt(x) + 1` must be calculated based on the value of `x`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
**State: **`i` is 1, `isqrt(x) + 1` must be calculated based on the value of `x`**.
