Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` holds true.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `right` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` also remains valid.
