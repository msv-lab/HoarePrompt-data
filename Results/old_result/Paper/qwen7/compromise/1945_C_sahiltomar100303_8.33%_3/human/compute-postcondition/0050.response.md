Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `i` is initially `mid + 1` and `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains `mid + 1` and `n` must still be greater than `mid + 1`. The only change is that `rightOne` has been incremented by 1.
