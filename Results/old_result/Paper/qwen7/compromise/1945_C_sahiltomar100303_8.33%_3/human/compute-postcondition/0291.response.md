Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `right` equals `n`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, and either `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n + 1) // 2` is true.**

This means that after executing the if-else block, `left` remains 0, and the counts of zeros and ones (`leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`) are as described. The variables `right`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` do not change. Additionally, the condition involving `rightOne` (either greater than or equal to half of `n+1` or less than half of `n+1`) must hold true.
