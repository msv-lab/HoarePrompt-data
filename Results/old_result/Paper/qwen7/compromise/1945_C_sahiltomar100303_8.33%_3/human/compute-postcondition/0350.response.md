State: **`i` must be equal to `mid - 1`, `n` is the upper limit of the range**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(mid, n):` starts from `i = mid` and increments `i` until `i` is no longer less than `n`.
2. The initial condition given is that all variables are updated according to the loop's execution until `i` equals `mid - 1`.
3. For the loop to start executing, `i` must be set to `mid - 1` because the loop begins at `i = mid` and the loop will not start if `i` is already greater than or equal to `mid`.
4. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the range but does not affect whether the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is `mid - 1` and `n` is the upper limit of the range.
