Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `n`; `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and remains unchanged; `trightZero` is decremented by 1; either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds true.**

Explanation: 
- `right` was incremented by 1 and is still less than `n`.
- `tleftZero` was incremented by 1 and remains unchanged.
- `trightZero` is decremented by 1.
- The condition `either tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds true because only `trightZero` has been modified, and the other variables (`tleftZero` and `trightOne`) remain unchanged.
