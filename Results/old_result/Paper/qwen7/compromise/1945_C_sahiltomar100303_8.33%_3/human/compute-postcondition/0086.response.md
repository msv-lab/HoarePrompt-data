Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `left` is `mid-2`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` or `rightOne` is increased by 1 depending on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or '1', `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
