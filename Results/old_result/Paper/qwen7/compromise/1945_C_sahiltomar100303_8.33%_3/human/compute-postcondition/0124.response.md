Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` starting from index `mid` to the final value of `right`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, and `leftOne` is `0` because the loop does not affect it further. The variable `right` is no longer equal to `n`, as the if condition `right != n` is now satisfied.
