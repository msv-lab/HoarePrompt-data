Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, `rightOne` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was previously increased by 1 whenever `s[mid]` is '0', it is now increased by 1 regardless of the condition. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition for `rightZero` remain unchanged.
