Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 (now `rightZero + 1`).**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `rightZero` was increased by 1 before this line of code, the new value of `rightZero` is now `rightZero + 1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
