Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must satisfy `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` and is now decreased by 1, and `rightOne` must satisfy `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`**.

The value of `leftZero` is decreased by 1, but the exact numerical value of `leftZero` is not specified. The conditions for `left` and `rightOne` remain unchanged.
