Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `mid + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`.
   - Additional information about `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and `s` is given but not directly relevant to adjusting the loop state.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `mid + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mid + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than `mid + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 2`**.
