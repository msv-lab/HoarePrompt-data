Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` starting from index `mid` to the final value of `right`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, and `leftOne` is `0` because the loop does not affect it further. The variable `right` equals `n`, and `right` is not different from `n`. If the number of '1's (`rightOne`) in the substring is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, the number of '1's is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
