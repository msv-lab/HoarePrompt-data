Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The line `trightZero += 1` increases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `mid + 1`, `n` must still be greater than `mid + 1`, and `rightZero` is also unchanged, but now `trightZero` has been incremented by 1.
