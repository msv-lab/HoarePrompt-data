Output State: **`trightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is equal to `n` or less than `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` remains unchanged, `trightOne` remains unchanged.**

The code `trightZero = 0` sets the variable `trightZero` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
