Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2 + 1, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, `leftOne` is n - rightOne, `right` is mid + 1, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, `trightOne` is less than or equal to (n - mid - 1) // 2, and `tleftOne` is either `tleftOne` or `tleftOne + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was either 0 or n//2, after incrementing `tleftZero` by 1, `leftZero` becomes either 0 or n//2 + 1. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.
