Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and `mid` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `mid`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `mid`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` initially.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `mid` and `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute.

Given the information, the initial state before the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `mid`, `mid` is defined, `n` is defined and `i` must be less than `n`**
