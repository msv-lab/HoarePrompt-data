Output State: **`leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `leftOne` to 0. This does not affect the values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `mid`. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.
