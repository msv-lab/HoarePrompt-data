Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightZero` is only incremented when `s[i]` is '0', and there is no such condition here, `rightZero` remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `n` stay the same as they were in the initial state.
