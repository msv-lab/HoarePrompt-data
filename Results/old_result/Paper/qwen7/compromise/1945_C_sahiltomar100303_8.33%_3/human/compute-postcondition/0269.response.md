Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\), `tleftOne` is either equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 - 1\) or increased by 1, and `trightOne` is either less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2\) or decreased by 1; `right` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was initially less than `n`, after incrementing, `right` is still less than `n`. The conditions for `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the increment operation. Therefore, the updated condition for `right` is that it is increased by 1, while the other conditions remain the same.
