Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`.
- `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`.
- `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`.
- `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`.
- `right` is `n`.
- `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`.
- The condition `rightOne < (n + 1) // 2` is true.

We need to determine the value of `right` when the print statement `print(right)` is executed.

From the initial state, it is explicitly stated that `right` is equal to `n`.

Therefore, the value of `right` will be `n`.

Output: **n**
