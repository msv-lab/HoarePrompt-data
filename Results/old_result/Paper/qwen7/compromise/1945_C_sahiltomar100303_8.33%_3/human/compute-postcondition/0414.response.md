Postcondition: `left` is `0`, `leftZero` is either `0` or `n//2` (depending on the number of zeros encountered), `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1` (depending on the number of ones encountered), `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, and `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`; `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(mid + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`; `s[right]` is `'1'`
