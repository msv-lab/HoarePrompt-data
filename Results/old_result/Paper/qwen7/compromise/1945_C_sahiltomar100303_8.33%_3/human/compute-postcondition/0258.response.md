Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is decreased by 1, and `s[right]` is not equal to '0', and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
