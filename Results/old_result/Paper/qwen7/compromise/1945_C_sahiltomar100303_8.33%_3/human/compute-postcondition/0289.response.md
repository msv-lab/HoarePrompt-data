Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `right` equals `n`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, and either `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2` is true, in which case `rightOne` remains unchanged and `rightZero` remains unchanged, or `rightOne < (n + 1) // 2` is true, in which case `rightOne` remains unchanged and `rightZero` remains unchanged.
