Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` must satisfy the condition `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `mid-1` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightZero` and `rightOne` are adjusted based on the value of `s[left - 1]`: if `s[left - 1]` is '0', `rightZero` is increased by 1 and `leftZero` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 1.
