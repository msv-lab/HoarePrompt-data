Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`.**

The code calculates the integer division of `n` by 2 and assigns the result to the variable `mid`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
