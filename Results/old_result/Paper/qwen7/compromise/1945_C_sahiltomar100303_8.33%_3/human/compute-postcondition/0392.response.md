Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must satisfy `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` and is now equal to `leftZero - 1`, and `rightOne` must satisfy `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The conditions for `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged except for `leftZero`, which is now decreased by 1. Therefore, the updated state reflects these changes.
