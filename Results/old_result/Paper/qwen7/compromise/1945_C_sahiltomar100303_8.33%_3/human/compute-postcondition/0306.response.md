Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- Other variables (`leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`, `right`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne`) are not relevant to the `print(left)` statement since they do not affect the value of `left`.

Given that `left` is explicitly set to 0, the `print(left)` statement will simply print the value of `left`.

Output: **0**
