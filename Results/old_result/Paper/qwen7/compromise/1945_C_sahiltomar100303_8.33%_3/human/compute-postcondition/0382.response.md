Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now (`leftZero` - 1), `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is now (`rightZero` + 1), the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
