Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, `leftOne` is n - rightOne, `right` is mid + 1, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, `trightOne` is less than or equal to (n - mid - 1) // 2, and `trightZero` is either `trightZero - 1` or `trightZero` depending on the value of `s[right]`. If `s[right]` is '0', `trightZero` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**
