Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, and `leftOne` is n - rightOne; `right` is mid, `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, and `trightOne` is greater than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2 - 1; `tleftOne` is tleftOne + 1.**

Explanation: The line `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. Since `trightOne` was initially greater than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, after subtracting 1, it is now greater than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
