Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0. Since `left` is already 0, `leftZero` would be 0 because no zeros need to be counted.
- `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0. Again, since `left` is 0, no zeros need to be counted, so `rightZero` is also 0.
- `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0. Similarly, since `left` is 0, no ones need to be counted, so `rightOne` is also 0.
- `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0. Since `left` is 0, no ones need to be counted, so `leftOne` is also 0.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.
- `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus one.

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of `right`, which is `n`.

Output: **n**
