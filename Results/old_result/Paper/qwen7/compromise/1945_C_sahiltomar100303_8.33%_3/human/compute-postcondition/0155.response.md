Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `right` is `n`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, and `leftOne` is `0`. Depending on the condition `left == 0`, if `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` is updated to a new value. If `right` is equal to `n` and `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, `rightOne` is adjusted based on the given condition.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if or else part is executed, `i` remains `n-1`, `right` becomes `n`, and the counts of '0's and '1's in the relevant substrings and cumulative counts are correctly updated based on the conditions provided.
