Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` remains at least 2, `leftZero` is increased by 1 to 2, `n` is unchanged, `leftOne` is unchanged.**

The code `tleftZero += 1` increases the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Given that `leftZero` was initially increased by 1 in the initial state, it now becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
