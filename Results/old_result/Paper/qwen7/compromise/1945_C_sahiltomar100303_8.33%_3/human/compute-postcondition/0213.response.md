Postcondition: `s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s` such that `i + 1 < n`. If the character at index `i` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 2, `rightOne` is increased by 2 if the character is not '0', and `trightZero` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` is not '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 2, `rightOne` is increased by 3, and `trightOne` is increased by 1.
