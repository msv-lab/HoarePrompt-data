Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, `leftOne` is n - rightOne, `right` is mid + 1, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, `trightOne` is less than or equal to (n - mid - 1) // 2, and `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1**.

The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
