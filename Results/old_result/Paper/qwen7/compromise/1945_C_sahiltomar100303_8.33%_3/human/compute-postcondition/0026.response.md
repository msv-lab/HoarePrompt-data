Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 1, `leftOne` is updated by adding 1.**

The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `i` and `mid` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The precondition that `s[1]` being '0' updates `leftZero` and '1' updates `leftOne` is still valid, but since the condition is not checked here, `leftOne` is simply incremented.
