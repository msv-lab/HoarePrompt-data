Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\), `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and `trightOne` is less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2\)**.

This means that the value of `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions involving `right`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from the initial state.
