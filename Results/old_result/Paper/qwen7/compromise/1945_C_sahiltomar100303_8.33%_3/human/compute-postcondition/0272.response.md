Output State: **`right` is less than `n` and incremented by 1; `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\) and increased by 1; `trightOne` is less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2); `trightZero` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
