Postcondition: `right` is less than `n` and incremented by 1, `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\) and either increased by 1 or remains the same, `trightOne` is less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2\) and either decreased by 1 or remains the same, and `tleftOne` is equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 + 1\) if the condition `s[right] == '0'` is true, otherwise it remains as \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\).
