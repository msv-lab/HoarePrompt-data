Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the output state maintains the original conditions regarding `tleftZero` and `trightOne`, and updates `trightZero` to be its previous value minus 1.
