Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(mid)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mid` is a positive integer.
   - If the first character of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 4 and `leftOne` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `leftZero` is 3 and `leftOne` is 2.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `mid`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop can execute again as long as `mid` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `mid` remains the same (it must still be a positive integer greater than 1).

5. **Consider the postconditions related to `s`, `leftZero`, and `leftOne`**:
   - These variables are not directly affected by the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `mid`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is a positive integer greater than 1**
