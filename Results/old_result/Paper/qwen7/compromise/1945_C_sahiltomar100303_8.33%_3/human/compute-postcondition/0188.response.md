Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is at least 2, `leftOne` is `leftOne` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `leftOne` being increased by 1, while `i` and `mid` retain their original conditions.
