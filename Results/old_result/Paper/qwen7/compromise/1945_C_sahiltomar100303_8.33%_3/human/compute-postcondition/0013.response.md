Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(mid):` will execute if `mid` is at least 1. This is because `range(mid)` generates a sequence from 0 to `mid-1`, and if `mid` is 0, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `i` will take on values from 0 to `mid-1` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `mid` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `mid` is greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 (the starting point of the range).

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `mid` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `mid` must be greater than 0**
