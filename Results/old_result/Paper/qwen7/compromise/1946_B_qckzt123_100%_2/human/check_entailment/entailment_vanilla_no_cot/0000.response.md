Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It also reads the array `a`.

2. **Sum Calculation and Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The program calculates the initial sum of the array `s`.
   - It then finds the maximum subarray sum (non-negative sum) using Kadane's algorithm. This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum (`tmp`). If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to zero. The maximum value of `tmp` is stored in `t`.

3. **Final Answer Calculation**:
   - The final answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. This represents the sum of the array after performing the operations.
   - For each operation, the maximum subarray sum `t` is doubled and added to the answer. This doubling is done `k-1` times, ensuring that the maximum possible sum is achieved by inserting the maximum subarray sum multiple times.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - All calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
