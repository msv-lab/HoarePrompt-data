Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 4 modulo MOD, `ans` is 6 modulo MOD**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `t`. Given that `t` is 4 modulo MOD, and `ans` was initially 2 modulo MOD, adding `t` to `ans` results in `ans` being 6 modulo MOD. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
