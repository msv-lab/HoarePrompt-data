Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `k` is the number of iterations the loop ran plus 1, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is the cumulative sum of `t` values calculated throughout the loop iterations, modulo `MOD`, `a` is a list of integers read from the standard input, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the first element of the list `a`, `tmp` is 0 if the first element of `a` is less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the same as its initial value, `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `tmp` is the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `t`, and `t` is the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the third element of the list `a`, `tmp` is the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `x`, and `t` is the maximum value between the original `t` and `x`, and if `tmp` was less than 0, it is now set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
