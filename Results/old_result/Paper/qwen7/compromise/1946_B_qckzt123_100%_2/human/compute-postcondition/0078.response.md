Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` must be greater than 5, `ans` is `ans + t`**.

The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `t`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. The condition for `k` to be greater than 5 is still valid. The exact value of `ans` depends on its initial value before the operation, but it is now updated to include `t`.
