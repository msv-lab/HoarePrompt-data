Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t % MOD`, `ans` is equal to `ans + t % MOD`**

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be the remainder when `ans + t` is divided by `MOD`. Since `t` is already equal to `t % MOD`, adding `t` to `ans` and then taking the modulo `MOD` again does not change the value of `ans`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + t % MOD`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged.
