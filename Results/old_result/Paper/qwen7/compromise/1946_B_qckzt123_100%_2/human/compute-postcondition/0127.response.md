Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t * 2 % MOD`, `ans` is equal to `ans + t % MOD`**

Explanation: The code multiplies `t` by 2. Since `t` was previously equal to `t % MOD`, after the multiplication, `t` becomes `t * 2 % MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
