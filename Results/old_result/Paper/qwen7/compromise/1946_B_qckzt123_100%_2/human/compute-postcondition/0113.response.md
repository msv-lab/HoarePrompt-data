Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the third element of the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the original `tmp` and `x`, and `t` is the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `t`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the third element of the list `a`, `tmp` now holds the sum of its original value and `x`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not directly modified by the code.
