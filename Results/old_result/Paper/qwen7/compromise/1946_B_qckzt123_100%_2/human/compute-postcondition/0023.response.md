Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, `s` is the sum of all elements in the remaining list `a`**.

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` sets the value of `tmp` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
