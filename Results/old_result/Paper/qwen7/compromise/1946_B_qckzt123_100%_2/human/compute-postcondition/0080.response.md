Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < k - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `k` must be greater than 5
   - `ans` is `ans % MOD` (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must still be greater than 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 5
- `k` must be greater than 5

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 5, `k` must be greater than 5**
