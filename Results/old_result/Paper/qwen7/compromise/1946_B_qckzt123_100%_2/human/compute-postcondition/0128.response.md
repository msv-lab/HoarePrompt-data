Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t % MOD`, `ans` is equal to `ans + t % MOD`**

The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, or `ans`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The updated value of `t` is now `t % MOD`, which is assigned back to `t`. The value of `ans` remains `ans + t % MOD` because the operation only modifies `t`.
