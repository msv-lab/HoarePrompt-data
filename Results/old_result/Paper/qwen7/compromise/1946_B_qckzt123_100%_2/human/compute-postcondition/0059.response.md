Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is 0, `ans` is 48 modulo MOD, `k` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `tmp` is 0, `x` is the first element of `a`, `t` is 0**

Explanation: The line `t = max(tmp, t)` updates `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`. Given that both `tmp` and `t` are initially 0, `max(0, 0)` is 0. Therefore, `t` remains 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
