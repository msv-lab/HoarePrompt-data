Output State: **`T` is an integer read from standard input and stripped of any trailing whitespace, and it is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive; `MOD` remains 1000000007.**

The code reads an integer from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and assigns it to `T`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` now holds the same value but is explicitly assigned through the code. The value of `MOD` remains unchanged.
