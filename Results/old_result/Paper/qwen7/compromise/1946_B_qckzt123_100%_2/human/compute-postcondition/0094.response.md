Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(T)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `T` (which determines the number of iterations) and the loop counter `_` (which is incremented in each iteration).

2. **Understand the Current State**: After the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is equal to `k`, indicating the total number of iterations completed.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop ran.
   - `t` is `t % MOD` and represents the highest value that `tmp` reached during any of the loop's iterations.
   - `ans` is the cumulative sum of `t` values calculated throughout the loop iterations, modulo `MOD`.

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` must be incremented. This means that the number of iterations will increase by 1. Therefore, `k` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will become `k + 1` because the loop counter `_` will be incremented, making the next iteration the `(k + 1)`-th iteration.
   - `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` becomes `k + 1`.
   - `t` remains the same as it is updated within the loop body but not directly affected by the loop counter increment.
   - `ans` remains the same as it is updated within the loop body but not directly affected by the loop counter increment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is equal to `k + 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop ran plus 1, `t` is `t % MOD` and represents the highest value that `tmp` reached during any of the loop's iterations, `ans` is the cumulative sum of `t` values calculated throughout the loop iterations, modulo `MOD`.**
