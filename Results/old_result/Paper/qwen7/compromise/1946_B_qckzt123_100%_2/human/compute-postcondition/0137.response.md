Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k-1`, `t` will be equal to `2^(k-1) % MOD`, and `ans` will be equal to the sum of `t` from `0` to `2^(k-1) - 1` modulo `MOD`.

To understand this, let's break it down:
- The loop runs `k-1` times, so `i` will be `k-1` at the end.
- In each iteration, `t` is multiplied by 2 and then taken modulo `MOD`.
- Therefore, after `k-1` iterations, `t` will be `2^(k-1) % MOD`.
- Each iteration also increments `ans` by the current value of `t`, which is `2^i % MOD` for the `i`th iteration.
- So, `ans` will be the sum of `2^i % MOD` for `i` from `0` to `k-2`, which simplifies to `2^(k-1) - 1` modulo `MOD`.
