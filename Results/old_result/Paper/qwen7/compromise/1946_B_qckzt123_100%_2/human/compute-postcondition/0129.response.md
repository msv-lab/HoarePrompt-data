Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t % MOD`, `ans` is equal to `ans + t % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `ans += t` updates the value of `ans` by adding `t` to its current value. Since `t` is already equal to `t % MOD`, the updated value of `ans` will be `ans + t % MOD`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged.
