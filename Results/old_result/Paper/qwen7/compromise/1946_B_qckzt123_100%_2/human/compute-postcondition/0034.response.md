Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2 modulo MOD, `ans` is 2 modulo MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` by performing a modulus operation with `MOD`. Since the initial value of `ans` is `t` (which is 2 modulo MOD), `ans` remains 2 modulo MOD after the operation. The other variables (`i` and `t`) are not affected by this operation.
