Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is 0, `ans` is 48 modulo MOD, `k` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `x` is the third element of `a`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the third element of the list `a`, `tmp` now holds the value of `tmp + x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
