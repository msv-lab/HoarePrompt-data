Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it generates a string consisting of the first \( k \) characters of the alphabet ("a" to "z") repeated \( n \) times and prints this string. The function repeats this process for a total of \( t \) times, where \( t \) is the number of test cases specified by the user. The final output is a collection of such strings, one for each test case.**
