Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of characters that are either in non-decreasing order (digits first followed by letters) or all characters are the same; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string sorted in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string sorted in alphabetical order; `sortedPassword` is a string that concatenates the sorted `digits` and `letters`.**

Explanation: The code `sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)` concatenates the `digits` list (which contains all digits from the original `password` in sorted order) and the `letters` list (which contains all letters from the original `password` in sorted order), and then joins them into a single string using `''.join()`. This new string `sortedPassword` maintains the order of digits followed by letters as per the initial conditions. The states of `password`, `digits`, and `letters` remain unchanged except that now there is a new variable `sortedPassword` which is the concatenated and joined version of `digits` and `letters`.
