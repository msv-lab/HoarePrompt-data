You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: Output State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: `password` is a string consisting of characters that are either in non-decreasing order (digits first followed by letters) or all characters are the same. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string sorted in ascending order. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string sorted in alphabetical order. If the loop returns `False`, it means the `password` does not meet the criteria of having digits and letters in non-decreasing order with digits coming before letters, or all characters being the same.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
2. For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
3. It sorts both lists separately.
4. It checks if any digit is greater than the next digit (to ensure digits are in non-decreasing order).
5. It also checks if any letter comes before a digit (to ensure letters are followed only by more letters or the end of the string).
6. After sorting the digits and letters separately, it concatenates them and compares the result with the original password to ensure the order is maintained as required.
7. The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and should work as intended according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
