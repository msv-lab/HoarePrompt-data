Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions. The function `func_1` properly checks the ordering of digits and letters within the password, ensuring that digits are sorted in non-decreasing order and placed after any letters, which themselves must also be sorted in non-decreasing order. The overall structure of the program handles multiple test cases as required.
