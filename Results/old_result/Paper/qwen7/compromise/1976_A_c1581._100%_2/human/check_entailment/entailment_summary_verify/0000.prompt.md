You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. It sorts the digits and letters within the password, checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order and come before any letters, and ensures all characters are either in non-decreasing order or identical. If the password meets these criteria, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are both letters and digits in the password, and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order. Specifically, the program checks if the sorted digits are in non-decreasing order and if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, but it does not ensure that all digits are in non-decreasing order relative to each other.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5
8
b123a456
```
- Expected Output:
```
NO
```
- Actual Output:
```
YES
```

In this case, the password `b123a456` has digits `123` and `456`, which are not in non-decreasing order. The program incorrectly returns "YES" because it only checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, but it does not check the order of the digits themselves.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all digits are in non-decreasing order before checking the rest of the conditions.
