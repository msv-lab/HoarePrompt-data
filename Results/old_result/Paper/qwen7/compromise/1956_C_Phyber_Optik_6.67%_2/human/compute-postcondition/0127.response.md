Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is any non-negative integer.
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

The `print` statement is as follows:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the integer `1` followed by the current value of `j`, with no newline character at the end (`end=' '`).

Output: **1 [j] (where j is the current value of j and is less than or equal to n)**
