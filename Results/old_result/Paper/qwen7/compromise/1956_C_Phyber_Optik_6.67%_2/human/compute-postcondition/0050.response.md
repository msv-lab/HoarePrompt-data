Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given information, `i` is initially set to `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` will execute as long as `i` is between 1 and `n + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n + 1`, it is not within the range `1` to `n + 1`. Therefore, the loop will not execute if `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - To make the loop execute, `i` must be within the range `1` to `n + 1`. This means `i` should start from `1` or any value less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `sum` is 0, but it is not part of the loop head.
   - `r` is 0, but it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is defined as `n + r + 1`, but it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` is greater than 0, but it is not part of the loop head.

Since the only variables that affect the loop execution are `i` and `n`, and `i` needs to be within the range `1` to `n + 1`, we need to adjust `i` to start from `1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer**.
