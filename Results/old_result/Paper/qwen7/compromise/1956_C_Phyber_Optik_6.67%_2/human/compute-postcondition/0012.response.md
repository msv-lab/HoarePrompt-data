Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` must be at least 1
- `i` is either 1 or 2
- `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`
- `r` is either 1 or 0

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop iterates over values from 1 to `n` inclusive. Therefore, if `i` is currently 1 or 2, it will change to the next value in the range during the next iteration.
2. **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop; it remains constant throughout the loop execution.
3. **Variables `t`, `sum`, and `r`**: These variables are not directly modified by the loop itself but may be affected by the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, these variables' values remain unchanged unless explicitly modified inside the loop body, which is not the case here.

### Next Iteration
- Since `i` is either 1 or 2, the next value of `i` will be the other value (either 2 or 1).
- `n` remains the same.
- `t`, `sum`, and `r` remain unchanged.

### Updated State
Given that `i` will change to the other value in the range (1 to `n`), let's consider both possible scenarios:

1. If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
2. If `i` was 2, it will become 1.

Since the loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`, and `n` remains the same, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within this range.

### Final State
- `t` must still be greater than 0
- `n` must still be at least 1
- `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2)
- `sum` remains unchanged
- `r` remains unchanged

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2), `sum` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged**
