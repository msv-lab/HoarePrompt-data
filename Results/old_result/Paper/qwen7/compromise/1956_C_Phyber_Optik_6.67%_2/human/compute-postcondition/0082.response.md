Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is the input integer
   - `r` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j` to `n + r + 1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + r + 1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is the input integer (unchanged)
   - `r` is 0 (unchanged)

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + r + 1`.
   - Since `r` is 0, this simplifies to `j` being less than or equal to `n + 1`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, the loop will increment `j` by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 2.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `j` will be 2
   - `n` remains unchanged (the input integer)
   - `r` remains unchanged (0)

7. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is the input integer
   - `r` is 0

So, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `r` is 0**
