Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The loop runs for `t` iterations.
2. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know it involves the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`.
3. **Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a placeholder indicating that the loop variable itself is not used inside the loop. However, the loop does affect the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`.

Given the information:
- The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`.
- `r` remains `0` throughout the loop.
- After the loop, `j` will be `n + 1`, `n` will still be the input integer, and `r` will be `0`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `r` is `0`.

2. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed.

Since the loop has already completed all its iterations (as indicated by the condition that `j` is `n + 1`), there are no more iterations left to execute.

### Conclusion:
There is no need to adjust the states because the loop has already completed all its iterations.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `n` is the input integer, and `r` is `0`. The loop has completed all its iterations.**
