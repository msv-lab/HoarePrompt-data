Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operation and returns the result.**

Note: The specific operations to be performed on `t` and `n` are not detailed in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the constraints and input structure.
