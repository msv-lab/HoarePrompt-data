Given the initial state:
- `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `r` must be non-negative
- The condition `j <= n` is true

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(*range(1, n + 1))`.

Let's break it down:
1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, the output will depend on the specific value of `n` within the given range (1 to 500).

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a number between 1 and 500 inclusive)**
