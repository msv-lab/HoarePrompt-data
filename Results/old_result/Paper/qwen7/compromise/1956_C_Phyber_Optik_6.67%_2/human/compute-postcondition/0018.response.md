Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2).
   - `sum` is increased by either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, otherwise it is increased by `i * n`.
   - `r` is equal to `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, otherwise `r` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - Depending on the value of `i`, `sum` and `r` are updated based on the conditions provided.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` ranges from 1 to `n`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be either 1 or 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the other value in the range (if `i` was 1, then `i` will be 2, and vice versa).

6. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2).
   - `sum` and `r` will be updated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

Given that `i` was either 1 or 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be the other value. Therefore, if `i` was 1, it will be 2, and if `i` was 2, it will be 1.

Since the exact values of `sum` and `r` depend on the condition, we cannot specify them without knowing the exact value of `i` and `n`. However, we know that `sum` and `r` will be updated based on the condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2), `sum` and `r` will be updated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.**
