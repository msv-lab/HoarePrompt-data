Output State: **`i` is 2; `r` is 2; `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`**

The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`. However, since `n` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `sum`. But we know that `sum` now holds the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged.
