State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable) and `t`.
2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because the `range(t)` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.
3. **Consider the constraints on `n`**: The problem statement mentions that `n` is an integer with a value within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, but this constraint is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition. It is a constraint on the problem setup rather than the loop itself.
4. **Formulate the final state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the required state adjustment is: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500**.
