Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.
   - `r` must be non-negative.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `r`.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, `r` remains non-negative as it was initially.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `r` remains unchanged.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, `r` remains non-negative but does not change further (it stays as it was before).

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n + r`, the final value of `j` at the end of the loop will be `n + r`.
   - Therefore, the condition `j > n` will hold true at the end of the loop, meaning `r` remains non-negative but does not change further.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `n` remains within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.
   - `r` remains non-negative and does not change further.
   - The loop will execute one more time if `j` is still within the range of the loop, which means `j` will be `n + r`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `r` must remain non-negative and unchanged.

Since `j` will be `n + r` at the end of the current iteration, the loop will execute one more time if `j` is still within the range of the loop, which means `j` will be `n + r`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, `r` must be non-negative.**
