Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `r` is set to 0.
- `j` is stated to be greater than `n`.

However, the code snippet provided is:

```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

The key part here is the `range(1, n + 1)`. This function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator is used to unpack this range into separate arguments for the `print` function.

Given that `j` is greater than `n`, it does not affect the range generation or the printing process. The `print` function will output the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 2 3 ... n** (where `n` is the input integer)
