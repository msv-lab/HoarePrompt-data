Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` will still be the input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `r` will remain non-negative and unchanged. The variable `sum` will contain the sum calculated during the loop's execution. The variable `t` will be greater than 0. The loop will have printed sequences for each value of `j` from 1 to `n + r + 1`, following the specified rules for printing based on whether `j` is less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`.

In more detail, the loop will have completed all its iterations, and the final values of the variables will be as follows:
- `j` will be `n + r + 1`
- `n` will be the original input integer
- `r` will be non-negative and unchanged
- `sum` will contain the sum calculated during the loop's execution
- `t` will be greater than 0

The output will consist of lines printed during each iteration of the loop, with `j` ranging from 1 to `n + r + 1`, and the values of `sum` and `n + r` printed at the end of the loop.
