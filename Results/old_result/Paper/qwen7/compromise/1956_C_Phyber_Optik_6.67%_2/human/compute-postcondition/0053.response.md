Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true; `r` is 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. Since `n * (n + 1) // 2` is a specific value based on the current `n`, it is added to `sum`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
