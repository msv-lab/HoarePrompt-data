Given the initial state:
- `j` is 2
- `n` is the input integer
- `r` is 0

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Since the value of `n` is not explicitly provided, we will keep it as `n` in the output.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer)**
