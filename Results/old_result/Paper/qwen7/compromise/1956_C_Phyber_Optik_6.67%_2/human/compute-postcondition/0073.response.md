Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + r + 1`.

3. **Determine the Initial Values Needed**: 
   - `j` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n + r + 1`.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `r` is an auxiliary variable used within the loop, but its initial value is not specified in the loop head. However, it is updated inside the loop based on the condition involving `i` and `n`.

4. **Initial Values for `j`, `n`, and `r`**:
   - `j` should start at 1.
   - `n` is already given as the input integer.
   - `r` needs to be initialized to 0 because it is not specified otherwise and it will be updated inside the loop.

5. **Final Value of `sum`**:
   - The final value of `sum` is determined by the rules described in the problem statement. However, for the loop to start executing, we only need to ensure the initial values of `j`, `n`, and `r`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `j` should start at 1.
- `n` should be the input integer.
- `r` should start at 0.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `r` is 0**.
