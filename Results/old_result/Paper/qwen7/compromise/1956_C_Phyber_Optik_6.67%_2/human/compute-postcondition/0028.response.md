Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `r` must be non-negative.
- The condition `j <= n` is true.

The `print(1, j, end=' ')` statement will print the integer 1 followed by the value of `j`, with no newline character at the end (`end=' '`).

Since `j` is defined such that `j <= n` and `n` is within the range 1 to 500, `j` could be any integer from 0 up to `n`. However, without an explicit value for `j`, we can only describe it in terms of its constraints.

Output: **1 [j] (where j is an integer such that 0 <= j <= n)**
