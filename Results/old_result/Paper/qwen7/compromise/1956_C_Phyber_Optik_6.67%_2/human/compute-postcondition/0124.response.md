Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, or `i * n` otherwise.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum, n + r)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`, which further simplifies to `n + 1 // 2 > n`. This is false for any positive integer `n`, so the sum will be `i * n`, which is `n * n`.

   - Therefore, `sum` is `n * n`.

   - The value of `r` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. However, since it is not part of the calculation for `sum`, it does not affect the value of `sum`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `sum` and `n + r`.
   - Given that `sum` is `n * n`, the output will be `n * n` followed by `n + r`.

Output: **n * n, n + r**
