Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the sum directly without performing any operations, which is not aligned with the problem description.

According to the problem, Nene can perform up to 2n operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. However, the program does not actually perform any operations. Instead, it calculates a sum based on a formula that does not account for the operations allowed.

For example, consider a 2x2 matrix. The correct approach would involve performing operations to set specific elements to maximize the sum. The program, however, simply prints a sum calculated without any operations, which is incorrect.

Here's an example to illustrate the issue:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  7 3
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  1 1
  1 1 1
  ```

This shows that the program does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum, thus it is incorrect.
