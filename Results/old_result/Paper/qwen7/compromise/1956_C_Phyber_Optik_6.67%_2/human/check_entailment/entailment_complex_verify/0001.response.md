### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the elements of a row or a column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed.
   - The sum is calculated as follows:
     - If \( n(n+1)/2 \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is greater than \( i \times n \) for some \( i \), then the sum includes \( n(n+1)/2 \).
     - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to the sum.
   - The number of operations required is \( n + r \), where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( n(n+1)/2 > r \times n \).
   - The solution prints the sum and the number of operations.
   - It then performs the operations:
     - For the first \( n \) operations, it sets the first element of each row to the corresponding index (i.e., \( a_{i,1} = i \)).
     - For the remaining operations, it sets the first element of each column to the corresponding index (i.e., \( a_{1,i} = i \)).

3. **Verification**:
   - **Sum Calculation**:
     - The sum calculation logic is flawed. The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is incorrect. This condition is checking if the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is greater than \( i \times n \), which is not relevant to the problem. Instead, we should consider how to fill the matrix to achieve the maximum sum.
   - **Number of Operations**:
     - The number of operations is correctly determined as \( n + r \), but the logic to determine \( r \) is also incorrect. The correct approach would be to fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum, not just counting the number of operations.
   - **Operations Performed**:
     - The operations performed are not optimal. Setting the first element of each row and column to the corresponding index does not necessarily maximize the sum. We need to strategically place the values to achieve the maximum sum.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The sum calculation should be based on filling the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum. The correct approach would be to fill the matrix with the highest possible values in the first row and first column, and then fill the rest of the matrix.
- The operations should be designed to fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum. For example, setting the first row and first column to the sequence \(1, 2, \ldots, n\) is a good start, but additional operations may be needed to further maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. The sum calculation and the number of operations are incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
