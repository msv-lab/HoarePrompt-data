Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k-1`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is equal to the new `ans1`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains within the original range, `ans1` is reduced by twice the value of `a[i + x]`, `ans2` now equals the updated `ans1`, and `ans` is reassigned to be the maximum between the current values of `ans1` and `ans2`.
