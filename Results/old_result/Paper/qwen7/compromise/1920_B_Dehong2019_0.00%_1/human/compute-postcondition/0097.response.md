Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, `ans` is the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`, `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` decreases the value of `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. The other variables (`ans`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
