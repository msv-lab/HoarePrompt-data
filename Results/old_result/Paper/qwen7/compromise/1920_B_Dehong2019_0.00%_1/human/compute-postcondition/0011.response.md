Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans1` is decreased by `a[2] * 2`; `x` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans1` by subtracting `a[i] * 2` from it. Given that `i` is initially 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`. Since `ans1` is initially decreased by `a[0] * 2`, it is now further decreased by `a[2] * 2`. The value of `x` remains unchanged.
