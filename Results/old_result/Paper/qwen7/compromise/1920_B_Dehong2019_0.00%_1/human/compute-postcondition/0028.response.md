Output State: **`ans` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. It does not affect `ans1`, `i`, or any other variables. The precondition that `i` is `i + 1` remains true after this line of code is executed.
