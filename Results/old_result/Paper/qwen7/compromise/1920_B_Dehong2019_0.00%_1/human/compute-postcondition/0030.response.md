Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `ans` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 2`. Since `ans` is initially set to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, its value remains unchanged unless `ans1` becomes greater than `ans2` after the addition. However, since no comparison or reassignment to `ans` is explicitly shown in the given code snippet, `ans` retains its original value which is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
