Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `x` (which is the upper limit of the range).

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[k - 1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `x-1`, meaning `i` will increment from `0` to `x-1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `k - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is defined before the loop starts.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `k`.
   - The value of `ans1` will remain the same as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `k`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[k - 1]`**.
