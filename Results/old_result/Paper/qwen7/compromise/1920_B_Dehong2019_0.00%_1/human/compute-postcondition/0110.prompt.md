Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ `x`, `k` ≤ `n`; and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` will be equal to the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. The variable `i` will be equal to `k - 1`, as it increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. `ans1` will be the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` (if within bounds). `ans2` will retain its initial value since it is only updated if `ans1` becomes greater than `ans2` during the loop, but no such update has occurred based on the given information.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will hold the highest value between `ans1` and `ans2`, with `i` being the last index processed by the loop, `ans1` being the adjusted sum of selected elements as described, and `ans2` staying the same as initially set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is within the range 0 to `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of `a[0]` to `a[k-1]` with adjustments based on the value of `x` and the condition `i + x < n`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have gone through all possible values from 0 to `k-1`. During each iteration, `ans1` accumulates the sum of elements from the array `a` starting from index `i` up to `i + x - 1` (if within bounds), while also subtracting twice the element at index `i + x` if it exists. `ans2` is always kept equal to `ans1`, and `ans` keeps track of the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` throughout the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `ans` will be the maximum value between the final `ans1` and `ans2`. `ans1` will be the sum of elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` in list `a`, adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, if `i + x < n`, the value at index `i + x` will be subtracted twice from `ans1`. `ans2` will remain equal to the final value of `ans1`.

This means that `ans1` will accumulate the sum of the relevant elements in `a` with certain adjustments, and `ans` will hold the maximum value found during these adjustments over all iterations of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
