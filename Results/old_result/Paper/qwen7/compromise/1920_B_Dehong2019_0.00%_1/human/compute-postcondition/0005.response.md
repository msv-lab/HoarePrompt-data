Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces, and `a` is a list of these integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a`, which is a list of integers sorted in descending order. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `ans1` is assigned the sum of all elements in `a`.
