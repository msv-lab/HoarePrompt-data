Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increases the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The value of `ans` remains the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` since no operation directly affects `ans`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1.
