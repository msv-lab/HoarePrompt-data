Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i_new]`, `ans` is the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`, `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increases `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is `i_new`. The value of `ans` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`. The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
