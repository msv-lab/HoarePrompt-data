To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` from the end.
   - `outind` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
   ```

3. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - `len(inpstr)` gives the length of the string `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' from the end.
   - `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B'.
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the distance between the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string `inpstr`.

Given the initial state, we need to find the indices `ind1` and `ind2` for the string `inpstr`. However, since the actual content of `inpstr` is not provided, we can only express the result in terms of these indices.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the distance between the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string `inpstr`.

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1**
