You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is an `answer` list of length `n-1`. This list is constructed by iterating through the range from 1 to `n-1` and appending elements from the `array` list based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each odd `i`, the last element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) is used to index into `array` and append the corresponding element to `answer`. For each even `i`, the first element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) is adjusted and then used to index into `array` to append the corresponding element to `answer`.
    #
    #After all iterations, `a[-1]` will be reduced to `2-n` and `a[0]` will be increased to `n-1`. Therefore, the `answer` list will contain elements from `array` in a specific pattern determined by these adjustments. The exact elements in `answer` depend on the initial values of `n` and the behavior of the loop, but it will always be a permutation of the elements from 1 to `n` excluding one element, which is 1.
    #
    #For example, if `n=4`, the `answer` list might look like `[1, 4, 3, 2]` or any other permutation of `[2, 3, 4]` since 1 is the first element in `answer` and the rest are derived from `array` based on the loop's conditions.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation of length n for the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes an array `array` with values from 1 to n.
   - It starts constructing the answer array `answer` with the value 1.
   - It uses a list `a` initialized as `[1, -1]` to keep track of indices for selecting elements from the `array`.

3. **Building the Permutation**:
   - The loop runs from 1 to `n-1` to fill the rest of the `answer` array.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `(-1) ** i` is `-1`, it appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - Otherwise, it appends `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic and constraints:

1. **k-Level Permutation Definition**:
   - A permutation is k-level if the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.

2. **Pattern in the Given Program**:
   - The program alternates between selecting elements from the start and end of the `array`. This pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will be close to each other because the differences between consecutive elements in the `array` are small (just 1).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles even `k` correctly by alternating between the start and end indices.
   - The initial value of 1 in the `answer` array ensures that the first sum is 1, and the subsequent sums follow a pattern that maintains the k-level property.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `array = [1, 2]`
  - `answer = [1, 2]`
  - Sums: `1 + 2 = 3`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
  - `array = [1, 2, 3]`
  - `answer = [1, 2, 3]`
  - Sums: `1 + 2 = 3`, `2 + 3 = 5`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 10`, `k = 4`
  - `array = [1, 2, 3, ..., 10]`
  - `answer = [1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`
  - Sums: `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`, `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`, etc.

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs a k-level permutation by alternating between the start and end of the array, ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length k are close to each other.
