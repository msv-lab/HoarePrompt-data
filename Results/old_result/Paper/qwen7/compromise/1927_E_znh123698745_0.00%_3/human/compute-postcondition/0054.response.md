Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged, `answer` is updated with the element at index `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` from the `array` to the list `answer`. Since the initial state of `array` is unchanged, the only new information is that `answer` now contains the element at the index `array[a[-1]]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
