You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is an `answer` list of length `n-1`. This list is constructed by iterating through the range from 1 to `n-1` and appending elements from the `array` list based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each odd `i`, the last element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) is used to index into `array` and append the corresponding element to `answer`. For each even `i`, the first element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) is adjusted and then used to index into `array` to append the corresponding element to `answer`.
    #
    #After all iterations, `a[-1]` will be reduced to `2-n` and `a[0]` will be increased to `n-1`. Therefore, the `answer` list will contain elements from `array` in a specific pattern determined by these adjustments. The exact elements in `answer` depend on the initial values of `n` and the behavior of the loop, but it will always be a permutation of the elements from 1 to `n` excluding one element, which is 1.
    #
    #For example, if `n=4`, the `answer` list might look like `[1, 4, 3, 2]` or any other permutation of `[2, 3, 4]` since 1 is the first element in `answer` and the rest are derived from `array` based on the loop's conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a set of test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) with `k` being even. It returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
