Based on the initial state provided:

- The `answer` list starts with the element 1.
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each odd `i`, the last element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) is used to append an element from `array`.
- For each even `i`, the first element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) is adjusted and then used to append an element from `array`.
- `a` starts as `[1, -1]`.
- `array` is a list of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Let's break down the process for a general `n`:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `answer = [1]`
   - `a = [1, -1]`

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - For `i = 1` (odd): Use `a[-1]` (which is `-1`), so append `array[-1]` (which is `n`) to `answer`. Now, `answer = [1, n]` and `a = [1, -1]`.
   - For `i = 2` (even): Adjust `a[0]` (which is `1`), so `a[0]` becomes `2`. Append `array[0]` (which is `1`) to `answer`. Now, `answer = [1, n, 1]` and `a = [2, -1]`.
   - Continue this process until `i = n-1`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `n-1` iterations, `a[-1]` will be reduced to `2-n` and `a[0]` will be increased to `n-1`.
   - The final `answer` list will contain elements from `array` in a specific pattern determined by the loop's conditions.

For example, if `n = 4`:
- Initial `answer = [1]`
- After `i = 1`: `answer = [1, 4]`, `a = [1, -1]`
- After `i = 2`: `answer = [1, 4, 1]`, `a = [2, -1]`
- After `i = 3`: `answer = [1, 4, 1, 3]`, `a = [2, -1]`

Thus, the final `answer` list for `n = 4` would be `[1, 4, 1, 3]`.

Output: **1 4 1 3 (the actual sequence depends on the value of n, but follows the described pattern)**
