Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - If `(-1)^i` equals -1, then `answer` contains the element at index `array[a[-1] - 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `a[0]` is increased by 1, and `answer` now contains the element `array[a[0]]` from the original list.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the New State:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being 1 and `n` being greater than or equal to 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 2) and `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
