Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `array` is unchanged, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decreases the last element of list `a` by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` is still greater than or equal to 3, `array` remains unchanged, `a[-1]` is now one less than its original value, and `answer` has a new element which is the updated value of `array[a[-1]]`.
