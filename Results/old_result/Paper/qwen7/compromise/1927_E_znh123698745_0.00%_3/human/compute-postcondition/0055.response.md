Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged, `answer` is updated with the element at index `array[a[-1]-1]`**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Since `a[-1]` was the last element of `a`, after decrementing, `a[-1]` now refers to the element at the new position, which is one index lower than before. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `array`, and `answer`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The `answer` is updated to reference the element at the new index of `a`, which is `array[a[-1]-1]`.
