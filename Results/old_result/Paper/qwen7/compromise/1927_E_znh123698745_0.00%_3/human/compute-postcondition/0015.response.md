Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `array` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `array` and `a`, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `i` and `n` are also not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `array[a[-1]]` to the `answer` list.
