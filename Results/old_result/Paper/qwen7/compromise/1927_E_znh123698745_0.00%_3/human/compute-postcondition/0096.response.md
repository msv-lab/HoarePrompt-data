Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers `n` and `k` (with `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` being even). For each test case, it constructs a list `answer` of length `n-1` by iterating through the range from 1 to `n-1`. During each iteration, it appends elements from a predefined list `array` (containing numbers from 1 to `n`) to `answer` based on specific conditions involving two indices `a[0]` and `a[-1]`. After processing all test cases, it prints the `answer` list for each case. The final state of the program is that it has printed the constructed `answer` lists for all given test cases.**
