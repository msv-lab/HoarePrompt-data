### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring chosen for a cyclic shift.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which is not consistent with the problem statement where the input is a binary string.
   - It splits the input string into a list of integers, which is incorrect because the input should be treated as a string.
   - The logic inside the loop is trying to count the number of 1s before a 0 appears and adding the cost (length of that segment plus one) to the answer. This logic does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation required to sort the string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, it will not solve the problem correctly.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify segments of 1s and 0s and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - The correct approach involves identifying the longest segment of 0s and calculating the cost to move all 1s to the front.

### Conclusion:
The given functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
