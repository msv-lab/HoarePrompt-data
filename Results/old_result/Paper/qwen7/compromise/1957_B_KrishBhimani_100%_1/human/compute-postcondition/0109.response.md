Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string for the last test case, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, and `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer. 

If `n` equals 1, then `k` remains unchanged, and `ans` is simply `k` itself. Otherwise, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that), `arr` is an empty list, `k0` equals `k`, `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`. `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))` to match the length of `n`.

All other variables that were not affected by the loop remain in their initial or previously calculated states from the last iteration of the loop.
