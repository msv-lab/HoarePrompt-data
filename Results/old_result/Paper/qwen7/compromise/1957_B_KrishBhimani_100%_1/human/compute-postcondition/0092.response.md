Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 4, and the most internal loop or if statement has been exited.**

Explanation: The value of `temp` is multiplied by 2, changing its value from 2 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
