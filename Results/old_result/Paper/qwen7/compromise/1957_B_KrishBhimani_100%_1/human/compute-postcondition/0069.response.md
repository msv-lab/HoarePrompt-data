Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`; `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element, which is `(1 << i) - 1`. After appending `k - sum(ans)`, `ans` now contains two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - (1 << i) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
