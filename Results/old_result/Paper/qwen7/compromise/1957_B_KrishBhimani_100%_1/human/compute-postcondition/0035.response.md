Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing two elements `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is either the final value it reached after being doubled as many times as possible without exceeding `k`, or 2 if doubling did not occur.**

Explanation: The code appends `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element `(1 << i) - 1`. After appending `k - sum(ans)`, `ans` now contains two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
