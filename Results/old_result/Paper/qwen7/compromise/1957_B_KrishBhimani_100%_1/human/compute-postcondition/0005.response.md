Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string.
2. `n` is an integer equal to 1.
3. `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

- The print statement `print(k)` will print the value of `k`.
- Since `k` is derived from converting the second element of `l1` into an integer, we need to know the content of `l1` to determine the exact value of `k`.

However, the initial state does not provide the specific input string used to create `l1`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `k` without this information. 

But based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`**
