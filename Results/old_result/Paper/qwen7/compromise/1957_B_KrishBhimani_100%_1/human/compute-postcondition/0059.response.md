Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All other variables retain their initial states.
