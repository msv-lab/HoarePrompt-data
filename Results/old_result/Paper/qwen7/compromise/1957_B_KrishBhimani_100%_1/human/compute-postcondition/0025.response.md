Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is true or false, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is within. Since there is no loop or if statement specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
