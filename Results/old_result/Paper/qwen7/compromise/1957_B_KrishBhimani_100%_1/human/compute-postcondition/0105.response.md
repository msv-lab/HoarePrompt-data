Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that), `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1`, and `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`; `ans` now contains `k - sum(ans)`, `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`**

Explanation: The line `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length is `n`. This means that if `len(ans)` is less than `n`, the list `ans` will be extended by `n - len(ans)` zeros. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
