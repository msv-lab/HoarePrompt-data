Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is `temp * 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `temp` is multiplied by 2. Since the initial value of `temp` was not specified, it remains as `temp * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
