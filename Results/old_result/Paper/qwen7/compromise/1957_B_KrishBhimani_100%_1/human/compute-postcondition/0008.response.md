Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, and `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `arr`. Since `l1`, `n`, and `k` are derived from the initial state and the code does not modify these variables, they remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is the only new variable introduced, and it is initialized as an empty list.
