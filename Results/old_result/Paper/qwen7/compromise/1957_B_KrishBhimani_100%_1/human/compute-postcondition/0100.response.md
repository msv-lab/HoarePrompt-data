Postcondition: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is either 1 or 3 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 4 or 2 based on the same condition.**
