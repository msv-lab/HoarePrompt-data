Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no such loop or if statement was specified in the code snippet provided, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current block. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
