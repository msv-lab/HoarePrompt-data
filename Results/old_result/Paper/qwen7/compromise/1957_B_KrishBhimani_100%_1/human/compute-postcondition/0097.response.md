Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 4 if `temp * 2 < k` is true, otherwise `temp` remains 2.**

Explanation: The code `temp *= 2` multiplies the value of `temp` by 2. Initially, `temp` was set to 4 if `temp * 2 < k` was true, or remained 2 otherwise. Since `temp` was either 4 or 2, multiplying it by 2 will result in `temp` being 8 if it was initially 4, or 4 if it was initially 2. Therefore, `temp` is now 8 if `temp * 2 < k` was true, or 4 if it was false. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
