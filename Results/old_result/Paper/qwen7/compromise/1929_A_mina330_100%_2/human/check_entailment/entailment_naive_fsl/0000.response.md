Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the sorting and subtraction logic. The program sorts the array and then subtracts the smallest element from the largest element, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition.

To maximize the beauty, we need to ensure that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \) are maximized. Sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements only ensures that the first and last differences are maximized but does not guarantee that all intermediate differences are optimized.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program outputs `57`, but the correct maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[90, 54, 100, 43, 80]`. This gives us the following differences:
\[ (90 - 54) + (54 - 100) + (100 - 43) + (43 - 80) = 36 - 46 + 57 - 37 = 57 \]

However, another optimal arrangement could be `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]`, which gives:
\[ (100 - 90) + (90 - 80) + (80 - 54) + (54 - 43) = 10 + 10 + 26 + 11 = 57 \]

In this case, the program fails to find the correct maximum beauty because it only considers the extreme values after sorting. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
