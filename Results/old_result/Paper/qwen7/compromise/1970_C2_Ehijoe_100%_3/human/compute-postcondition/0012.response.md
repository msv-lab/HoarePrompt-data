Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is a list of length `n-1` containing pairs of integers representing the edges of the tree, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) of the tree, `start` is an integer equal to the input integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `moves` is a boolean value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the keys are integers from 1 to n and the values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of each node.**

Explanation: The code `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `nodes` and `start`. The function `func_1` returns a boolean value which is assigned to the variable `moves`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
