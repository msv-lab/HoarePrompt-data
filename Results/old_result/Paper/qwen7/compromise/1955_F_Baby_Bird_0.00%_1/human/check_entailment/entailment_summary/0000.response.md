Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win, which happens when the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers in the sequence is zero.
2. The provided solution attempts to calculate this by checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and adding 1 to a counter if they are. It also adds half of the total count of all numbers (integer division) to this counter.
3. However, the logic used does not accurately reflect the rules of the game. Specifically:
   - The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` is checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. This part is correct.
   - Adding `sum(p) // 2` to the counter is incorrect because it does not account for the actual bitwise XOR operation or the optimal removal strategy to maximize Bob's wins.
4. The solution does not correctly simulate the process of removing numbers to achieve the desired outcome (maximizing Bob's wins).

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
