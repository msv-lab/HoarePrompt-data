Output State: The output state is a series of integers representing the result of the loop for each test case. For each test case, the output is calculated as follows: if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, the output is 3; otherwise, it is the integer division of the sum of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s by 2. The results for all test cases are concatenated together.
