Functionality: **The function processes input data consisting of `t` sets of values, where each set includes integers `n` and `k` (with `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5`) and a series of edges defined by pairs of integers `v` and `u` (with `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`). For each set of input data, the function calls `solve()` exactly once. After processing all sets, the function returns no value but ensures that `solve()` has been executed `t` times.**
