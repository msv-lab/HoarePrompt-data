Reasoning:
- The function `func_1()` correctly processes the input and converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It handles the special case where the hour is '00' by printing '12'.
- For hours between '01' and '12', it directly prints the hour.
- For hours between '13' and '23', it correctly adjusts the hour by subtracting 12 and prepending '0' if necessary.
- It appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to 12.
- The function processes each test case as described and outputs the results in the required format.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
