Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then reads `t` lines of input, each containing a time in 24-hour format (e.g., "09:41").

2. **Extracting Hour and Minute:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the hour (`h`) and minute (`s[2:]`) from the input string `s`.

3. **Converting Hour to 12-Hour Format:**
   - If the hour is '00', it prints '12' followed by the minutes and 'AM'.
   - If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour directly followed by the minutes and the appropriate AM/PM indicator.
   - If the hour is greater than '12', it calculates the 12-hour equivalent by subtracting 12 from the hour and prepends a '0' if necessary (e.g., '21' becomes '09').

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - It uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` to determine whether to print 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour is 12 or greater.

### Testing the Logic:

1. **Hour '00':**
   - The program correctly converts '00' to '12:00 AM'.

2. **Hour '01' to '12':**
   - The program correctly prints these hours directly followed by 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour.

3. **Hour '13' to '23':**
   - The program correctly converts these hours to their 12-hour equivalents (e.g., '13' to '01:00 PM', '23' to '11:00 PM').

### Example Test Cases:

- **Input:** "09:41"
  - **Expected Output:** "09:41 AM"
  - **Program Output:** "09:41 AM"

- **Input:** "18:06"
  - **Expected Output:** "06:06 PM"
  - **Program Output:** "06:06 PM"

- **Input:** "12:14"
  - **Expected Output:** "12:14 PM"
  - **Program Output:** "12:14 PM"

- **Input:** "00:59"
  - **Expected Output:** "12:59 AM"
  - **Program Output:** "12:59 AM"

- **Input:** "00:00"
  - **Expected Output:** "12:00 AM"
  - **Program Output:** "12:00 AM"

- **Input:** "14:34"
  - **Expected Output:** "02:34 PM"
  - **Program Output:** "02:34 PM"

- **Input:** "01:01"
  - **Expected Output:** "01:01 AM"
  - **Program Output:** "01:01 AM"

- **Input:** "19:07"
  - **Expected Output:** "07:07 PM"
  - **Program Output:** "07:07 PM"

- **Input:** "11:59"
  - **Expected Output:** "11:59 AM"
  - **Program Output:** "11:59 AM"

- **Input:** "12:00"
  - **Expected Output:** "12:00 PM"
  - **Program Output:** "12:00 PM"

- **Input:** "21:37"
  - **Expected Output:** "09:37 PM"
  - **Program Output:** "09:37 PM"

### Conclusion:

After testing the logic with various valid inputs, the program correctly converts the 24-hour time to the 12-hour format as specified.

**Correctness: True**
