Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s` representing a time in the 24-hour format. For each test case, it converts the time from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format and prints the formatted time along with "AM" or "PM". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the formatted times for each test case.**
