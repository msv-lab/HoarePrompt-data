Postcondition: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of n constraints where n is an integer. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x, where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. The variable `to_int` is False, and `space` is False, so `line` is not split into a list of strings stored in `items`. Instead, `items` remains a list of characters from a line.
