Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `x + 1`, `z` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `z` is initially 1. The code updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `k` is an input integer, we cannot determine the exact value of `k - 1`, but we know that `z` will be updated to `1 + 1 = 2` because `z // (k - 1)` will be 0 (as division by a positive number results in an integer, and the smallest positive integer is 1, making the whole expression evaluate to 1). The values of `k`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
