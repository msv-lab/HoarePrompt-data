Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` equals `2x + 1` if `x >= k - 1`, otherwise `i` equals `x`, `z` equals `x + 1` if `x >= k - 1`, otherwise `z` equals `x + 1`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. However, since the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are not specified in the initial state, the only thing we can determine is that `a` remains unchanged. The conditions for `i` and `z` are based on the value of `x` relative to `k - 1`, which remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and the conditions for `i` and `z` based on their initial definitions.
