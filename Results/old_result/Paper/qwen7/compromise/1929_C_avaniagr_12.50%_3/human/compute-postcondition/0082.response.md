Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an integer (unchanged).
   - `x` is a non-negative integer (unchanged).
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is `x` (unchanged).
   - `z` is `z + 1` (unchanged).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x + 1`.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `x`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `x + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `x + 1`.
   - The other variables (`k`, `x`, `a`, and `z`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is `x + 1`, `z` is `z + 1`**.
