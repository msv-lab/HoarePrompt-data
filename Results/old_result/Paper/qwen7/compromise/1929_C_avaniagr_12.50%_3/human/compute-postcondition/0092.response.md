Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` equals `x + 3`, and `z` is updated to `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged and `z` is updated as described. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z` and `z` is updated as described.
