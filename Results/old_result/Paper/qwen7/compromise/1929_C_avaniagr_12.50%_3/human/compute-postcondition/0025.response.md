Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` modifies the value of `z`. However, the initial value of `z` and the value of `k` are not provided. Since `z` is updated based on its current value, the exact new value of `z` cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `z` and `k`. The precondition that `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 remains unchanged, and `i` remains 0.
