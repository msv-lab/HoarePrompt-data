Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state does not provide specific values for `k` and `x`.
- The value of `a` is mentioned but remains unchanged, so it's not relevant to the print statement.
- The value of `i` is determined by the condition `x >= k - 1`. If this condition is true, then `i = 2x + 1`; otherwise, `i = x`.
- The value of `z` is always `x + 1` regardless of the condition on `x`.
- Since the print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`, the output will be `YES`.
