Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `k` is an input integer (this variable is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `x` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is equal to `x`.
   - `z` is 1 (this variable is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < x + 1` must hold true. Since `i` starts at `x` and is incremented within the loop, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `x + 1`. However, since `i` is incremented within the loop, the condition `i < x + 1` must still hold true.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the following:
- `x` remains the same (since it is not modified in the loop).
- `i` is incremented by 1 from `x` to `x + 1`.
- `z` remains 1 (since it is not involved in the loop head).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `x + 1`, `z` is 1**
