Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `z` will be the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x + 1` times.

To explain further, since the loop runs from `i` in `range(x + 1)`, it will iterate `x + 1` times. Each iteration increments `z` by `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Therefore, after all iterations, `z` will be the result of adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x + 1` times.
