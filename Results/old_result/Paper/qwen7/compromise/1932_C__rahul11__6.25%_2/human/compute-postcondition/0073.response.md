Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `k` is 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, and the current value of `s[k]` is 'L'**.

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, the value of `s[k]` is 'L', and `k` is 0. After executing the code, `k` becomes 1, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
