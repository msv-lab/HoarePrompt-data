Output State: **The value of `ans` is the product of all elements in the list `arr`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the product of all the elements in the list `arr`. The state of all other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, and `res`) remains unchanged from their initial or previous states.
