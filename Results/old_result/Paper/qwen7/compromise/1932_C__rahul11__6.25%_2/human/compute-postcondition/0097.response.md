Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD - 1`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is `r - 1` if `s[1]` is not 'L', `c` is `c + 2`, `res[c]` is now `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation:
- The variable `k` remains unchanged at 2.
- The variable `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- The variable `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD - 1`.
- The variable `n` remains the number of elements in the array.
- The variable `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[1]` is not 'L'.
- The variable `c` is incremented by 2.
- The variable `res[c]` is now set to `ans % m % MOD`.
