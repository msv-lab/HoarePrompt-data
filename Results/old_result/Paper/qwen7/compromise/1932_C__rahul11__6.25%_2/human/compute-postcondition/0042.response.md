Output State: **`k` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 2, `r` is `r - 1`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD` if `s[2]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `r - 1` and `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. Given that `l` is 2, `ans` is now `ans // arr[2] % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
