Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD` or `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `l` is 2, `r` is `r - 1`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD` if `s[2]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `r - 1` and `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its initial value (which was not specified but implied to be 0) to 1. All other variables retain their previous states as per the initial conditions.
