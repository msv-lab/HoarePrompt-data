Output State: **`k` is 2, `l` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD - 1`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is `r - 1` if `s[1]` is not 'L', `c` is `c + 2`, `res[c]` is now `ans % m % MOD**.

This means that the variable `l` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
