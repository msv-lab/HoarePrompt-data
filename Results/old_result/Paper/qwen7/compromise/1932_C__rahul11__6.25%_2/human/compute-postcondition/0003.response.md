Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking a single line of input, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The original values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, but now `arr` holds the list of integers obtained from the input.
