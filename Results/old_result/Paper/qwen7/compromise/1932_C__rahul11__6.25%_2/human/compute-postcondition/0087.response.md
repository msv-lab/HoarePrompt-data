Output State: **`k` is 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD - 1`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` is now `ans // arr[r] % MOD**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. Therefore, `k` is still 1, `ans` is still updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is still `ans % m % MOD - 1`, `n` remains the number of elements in the array, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is now `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
