Correctness: **False**

The program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `MOD` variable is set to `10 ** 9 + 6`, but the problem does not specify any need for this large modulus. Instead, the modulus should be the one provided in the input (`m`).
2. The initial calculation of `ans` is done before any operations, which means it includes all elements of the array. This should be updated after each operation.
3. The loop runs `n-1` times, but the problem states that the array becomes empty after processing all commands. Therefore, the loop should run `n` times.
4. The `res` array is initialized with zeros, but the first element should be calculated correctly based on the initial product of the array.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = []
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res.append(ans)
        
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], -1, m)) % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], -1, m)) % m
                r -= 1
            res.append(ans)
        
        print(*res)

func()
```

This corrected version initializes `ans` correctly for each test case, updates `ans` after each operation, and ensures the loop runs `n` times to handle all commands.
