Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the annotated program to ensure it correctly implements the problem statement.

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `MOD` to \(10^9 + 6\) and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
3. **Result Array Initialization**: It initializes the result array `res` with zeros and sets `ans` to the product of all elements in `arr`.
4. **First Product Calculation**: The first element of `res` is set to the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` and `MOD`.
5. **Loop Through Commands**: The loop iterates through the string `s` and performs the following actions:
   - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element in `arr` and updates `res` with the new value of `ans` modulo `m` and `MOD`.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element in `arr` and updates `res` with the new value of `ans` modulo `m` and `MOD`.
6. **Update Pointers**: The pointers `l` and `r` are updated accordingly to reflect the removal of elements from `arr`.
7. **Printing Results**: After processing all commands, the results are printed.

The logic in the annotated program matches the problem description accurately. The program correctly calculates the product of the array elements, updates the product based on the commands, and stores the results in the `res` array. The use of `MOD` ensures that the intermediate and final results do not overflow.

Given the detailed analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
