Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration. For each input set (n, m, k), if \( n \le k \) or \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil < k \), it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The number of 'YES' and 'NO' printed will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
