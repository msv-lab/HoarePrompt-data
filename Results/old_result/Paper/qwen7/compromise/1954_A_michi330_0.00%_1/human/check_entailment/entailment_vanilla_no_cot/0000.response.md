Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Logic Error**: The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:` does not correctly determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
   
2. **Output Format**: The output should be in lowercase ('yes' or 'no') as per the problem statement.

Let's correct the logic:

- If `k >= n - 1`, then Bob can always repaint all but one part to match the color of the last part, making it possible for him to achieve his goal.
- Otherwise, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color if `m > 1` and `n > k`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1 or m == 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')

func()
```

This corrected version checks the conditions properly and outputs the result in the required format.
