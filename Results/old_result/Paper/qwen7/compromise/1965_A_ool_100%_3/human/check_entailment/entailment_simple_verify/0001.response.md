### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Calling the Function:**
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner based on the given piles.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes an array `arr` as input and returns the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob').

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Convert the Array to a Set and Sort It:**
   - The code converts the array `arr` to a set and then sorts it to get unique pile sizes in ascending order.
   - However, this step is unnecessary because the original array already contains unique values due to the problem constraints. Sorting is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

2. **Step 2: Check if the Smallest Pile Has More Than 1 Stone:**
   - If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, the function returns 'Alice'.
   - This step is correct because Alice can always win by removing 1 stone from each pile, making the smallest pile size 1.

3. **Step 3: Iterate Through the Sorted Unique Pile Sizes:**
   - The function iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, the function immediately returns 'Bob' because this indicates a losing position for the current player.
   - Otherwise, the boolean variable `A` is toggled to alternate between 'Alice' and 'Bob'.

4. **Step 4: Return the Winner Based on the Boolean Variable `A`:**
   - The function returns 'Alice' if the last value of `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.
   - This step is correct because the toggling of `A` simulates the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, ensuring the final result is determined based on the parity of the number of moves.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The check for the smallest pile being greater than 1 is correct and ensures Alice can always win in such scenarios.

2. **Iterative Check:**
   - The iterative check for differences between consecutive pile sizes is a simplified version of the XOR strategy used in the Nim Game theory. This approach is correct under optimal play conditions.

3. **Boolean Toggle:**
   - The toggling of the boolean `A` correctly simulates the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, ensuring the final result is determined based on the parity of the number of moves.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the Nim Game theory and the problem constraints. The sorting step is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
