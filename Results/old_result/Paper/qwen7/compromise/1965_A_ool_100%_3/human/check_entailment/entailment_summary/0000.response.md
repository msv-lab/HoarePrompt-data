Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to determine the winner based on the given rules. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed:
   - It converts the array to a set and sorts it, but this step is unnecessary for determining the winner.
   - It checks if the smallest element is not 1, which is a simple check but does not cover all scenarios.
   - The main logic to determine the winner is incorrect. The provided logic only checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted unique array is more than 1 and toggles a boolean `A`. This does not accurately reflect the game's rules or the winning strategy.

The correct approach involves using the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles after reducing them to the minimum pile size. This is a well-known solution for this type of game theory problem.

Given the execution summary, the function always returns 'Alice', which is incorrect. The correct implementation should use the XOR of the sizes of the piles after reducing them to the minimum pile size.

Correctness: **False**
