Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a list `arr` representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It first removes duplicate values and sorts the unique values in ascending order.
   - If the smallest value in the sorted list is not 1, it directly returns 'Alice', which is correct because if the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice can immediately reduce all piles to 1 stone and then force Bob into a losing position.
   - For the remaining cases, it checks the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list.
     - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to False and breaks out of the loop. This is correct because it indicates that there is a gap larger than 1 between some piles, which means Bob can force Alice into a losing position.
     - The variable `A` is toggled between True and False for each iteration of the loop. This logic is also correct because it simulates the alternating moves between Alice and Bob.
   - After the loop, if `not_c` is still True, `A` is toggled again. This ensures that if the differences are all 1 (indicating a pattern like [1, 2, 3, ...]), the final value of `A` is determined correctly.
   - Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise 'Bob'. This is correct based on the toggling logic.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is correct.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
