Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the first integer `n` as part of the array `arr`, which should be separate. The current code incorrectly merges `n` and the array into a single list.
2. **Redundant Code**: The `c = 1` and `while t > 0:` loop is unnecessary and can be removed.
3. **Logic Error in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` should correctly determine the winner based on the game rules.
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if set_[0] != 1:` is not sufficient to determine the winner.
   - The logic involving `not_c` and `A` is overly complex and incorrect for the game's rules.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    
    # Find the minimum value in the array
    min_val = min(arr)
    
    # Determine the winner based on the game rules
    if min_val == 1:
        # If the smallest pile has 1 stone, the player whose turn it is will lose
        if n % 2 == 0:
            print("Bob")
        else:
            print("Alice")
    else:
        # If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, the player whose turn it is will win
        if n % 2 == 0:
            print("Alice")
        else:
            print("Bob")

```

This corrected program correctly handles the input and determines the winner based on the game rules.
