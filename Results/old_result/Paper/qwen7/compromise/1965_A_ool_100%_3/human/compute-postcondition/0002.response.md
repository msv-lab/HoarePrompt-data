Output State: **`A` is False; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in place, meaning the original list is modified to be sorted. The initial state of `A` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the sorting operation. The list `set_` is now sorted in ascending order, but the specific elements are not specified without knowing the contents of `arr`.
