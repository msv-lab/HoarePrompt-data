Postcondition: **`A` is True, `not_c` is False, and `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with the first element being 1. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` remains False. Otherwise, `A` toggles between True and False based on the number of iterations.**
