Output State: **`A` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr`**.

Explanation: The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a set from the list `arr`, which removes any duplicate elements, and then converts it back into a list. However, since the initial state of `A` is `False` and there is no information about `arr`, `A` remains unchanged. The new variable `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr`.
