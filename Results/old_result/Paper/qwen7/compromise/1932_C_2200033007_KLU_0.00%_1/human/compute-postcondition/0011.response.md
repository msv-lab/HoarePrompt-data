Output State: **The program returns a list that is the reverse of `ans`, where `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements being the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element, and `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.**

To break this down:
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. As `l` and `r` are set to `n-1` and `0` respectively, `b` will be constructed by iterating through `s` and appending either `a[l]` or `a[r]` to `b` based on the character in `s`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element. This means that `ans[i]` is the product of all elements in the reversed `b` from index `i` to the end.
- `p` is the last value it was updated to after the loop, which is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.

The return statement `return reversed(ans)` simply reverses the list `ans` before returning it. Therefore, the output is the reversed version of `ans`, which contains the cumulative products as described above.
