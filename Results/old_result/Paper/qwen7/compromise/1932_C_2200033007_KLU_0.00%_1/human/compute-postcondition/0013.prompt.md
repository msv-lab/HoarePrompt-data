You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', then `b[i]` is `a[l]` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', then `b[i]` is `a[r]` and `r` is decremented. The final values of `l` and `r` will be `n-1` and 0 respectively after the loop completes.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. The final values of `l` and `r` will be `n-1` and 0 respectively, `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements being the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element, `p` is the last value it was updated to after the loop, which is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list that is the reverse of `ans`, where `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements being the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element, and `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list that is the reverse of `ans`, where `ans` is a list of length `n` with each element being the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element, and `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list that is the reverse of `ans`, where `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements being the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element, and `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
