Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. The final values of `l` and `r` will be `n-1` and 0 respectively, `ans` is a list of integers where each element is the product of all previous elements in `b` in reverse order, starting from the last element, and `p` is the last computed product value in `ans`.
