#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', then `b[i]` is `a[l]` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', then `b[i]` is `a[r]` and `r` is decremented. The final values of `l` and `r` will be `n-1` and 0 respectively after the loop completes.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. The final values of `l` and `r` will be `n-1` and 0 respectively, `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements being the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element, `p` is the last value it was updated to after the loop, which is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list that is the reverse of `ans`, where `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements being the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element, and `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by iterating through `a` and appending elements from the start or end based on the direction specified in `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` and stores these products in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns a list that is the reverse of `ans`.
