Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the commands in the string `s` and calculates the required remainders.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and appends the appropriate element from `a` to `b` based on the command ('L' or 'R').

3. **Calculating Remainders**:
   - After constructing the list `b`, it calculates the product of its elements and takes the remainder modulo `m`.
   - However, the program incorrectly constructs the list `b` by appending elements directly without considering the product calculation during the iteration.

### Issues in the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Construction of List `b`**:
   - The list `b` is constructed by simply appending elements from `a` based on the command, but it does not maintain the product of the remaining elements of `a` at each step.
   - The product should be calculated dynamically as elements are removed, but the current implementation does not do this.

2. **Reversing the List**:
   - The list `ans` is constructed by reversing the product calculations, which is not necessary and incorrect because the original requirement is to output the remainders at each step of the command processing.

### Correct Implementation

To fix the issues, we need to calculate the product of the remaining elements of `a` at each step and take the remainder modulo `m`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = (product * a[i]) % m
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `product` to 1 to keep track of the running product of the array elements.
   - Initialize `ans` to store the remainders at each step.

2. **Iterate Through Commands**:
   - For each command in the string `s`, update the product by multiplying the current element and taking modulo `m`.
   - Append the updated product to `ans`.
   - Remove the appropriate element from the array `a` based on the command ('L' or 'R').

3. **Return the Results**:
   - Return the list `ans` containing the remainders at each step.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the way it constructs the list `b` and calculates the remainders. The corrected program above ensures that the product is calculated correctly at each step and outputs the remainders as required.

**Correctness: False**
