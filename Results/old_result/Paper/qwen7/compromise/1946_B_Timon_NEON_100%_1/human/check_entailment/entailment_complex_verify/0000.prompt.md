You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

    #
    #Explanation: The provided code snippet aims to find the segment with the maximum sum in the array `arr`. However, the logic within the loop does not correctly update the `max_segment` or `segments_variants` lists. The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are not properly initialized or updated, leading to incorrect results. Given the initial conditions and the logic in the loop, the final state of the variables remains the same as the initial state.

    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `segments_variants` is now ['new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'], `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [len(arr) - 1]
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over `segments_variants`, which contains a single element 'new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'. Inside the loop, it checks if `total_max_segment[0]` is less than the first element of the current `segment` and if the length of the segment is not 1. Since `total_max_segment` starts as [-1] and the first element of the segment is `len(arr) - 1`, which is greater than -1 (assuming `len(arr) > 1`), `total_max_segment` gets updated to `[len(arr) - 1]`. All other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop's condition or actions.
    return total_max_segment
    #`total_max_segment` is [len(arr) - 1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the last index of the list (`len(arr) - 1`). It attempts to find the segment with the maximum sum but due to incorrect logic, it always returns the last index of the array.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer, and quantity is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= quantity <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_3(number, quantity):
    answer = 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `number` and a non-negative integer `quantity`, initializes a variable `answer` to 0, and then performs an unspecified operation involving both parameters. After the function concludes, it returns the value of `answer`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the `func_3` function is incomplete and does not handle the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires performing up to `k` operations to maximize the sum of the array by inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray at any position. However, the provided functions do not address this requirement.

Here's a brief breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incomplete Function**: The `func_3` function is defined but is not implemented to solve the problem. It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array.

2. **Missing Logic**: The `func_2` function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray but does not incorporate the ability to perform up to `k` operations to further increase the sum. It only finds the maximum sum subarray once and does not consider the possibility of inserting the sum of different subarrays multiple times.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
