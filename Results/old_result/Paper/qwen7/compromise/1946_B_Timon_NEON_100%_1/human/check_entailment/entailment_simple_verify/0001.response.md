### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The result must be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to consider the largest positive sums from the initial array and the subarrays formed during operations.
   - Inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the total sum, especially if the subarray has a large positive sum.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly computes the modulo operation, which is necessary for handling large sums.
   - **func_2**: This function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray(s) in the input array but does not fully implement the logic to handle multiple operations and insertions.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem as stated.

4. **Detailed Analysis of func_2**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to find the maximum sum subarray(s) in the array `arr`.
   - However, the logic within the loop does not correctly update the `max_segment` or `segments_variants` lists. The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are not properly initialized or updated, leading to incorrect results.
   - The function appends `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` to `segments_variants`, but it does not ensure that these segments are the maximum sum segments.
   - The function returns `total_max_segment`, which is set to `[len(arr) - 1]` in the end, indicating that it does not correctly identify the maximum sum segment.

5. **Analysis of the Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic assumes that `max_segment` is the maximum sum segment found by `func_2`.
   - If `max_segment[0]` is `-1`, it is set to `0`, which is incorrect because it implies that no positive sum subarray was found.
   - The formula `answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is intended to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, but it relies on the incorrect value of `max_segment`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as they do not implement the logic to handle the `k` operations and the insertion of subarray sums.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum subarray, and the main program logic incorrectly uses the result of `func_2`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
