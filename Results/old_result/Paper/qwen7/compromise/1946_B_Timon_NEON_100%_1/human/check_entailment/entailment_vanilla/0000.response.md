Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to consider the largest positive sums from the initial array and the subarrays formed during operations.
   - Inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the total sum, especially if the subarray has a large positive sum.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly computes the modulo operation, which is necessary for handling large sums.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray(s) in the input array. However, it seems incomplete as it does not fully implement the logic to handle multiple operations and insertions.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem as stated.

4. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - **func_2** does not fully address the problem requirements. It only finds the maximum sum subarray once and does not account for the insertion of these sums multiple times as allowed by the problem statement.
   - There is no logic to handle the `k` operations and the insertion of subarray sums into the array.
   - The function does not return the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as they do not implement the logic to handle the `k` operations and the insertion of subarray sums.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
