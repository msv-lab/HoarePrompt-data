Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(len(arr))`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(arr)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `segments_variants` is an empty list.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list.
   - `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`.
   - `max_sum` is `-1`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 1 (since `range(len(arr))` will generate values from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `len(arr)`, we need to ensure that `len(arr)` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 when the loop starts.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `len(arr)` must be at least 1.
- `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `len(arr)` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
