You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where -10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for each element arr[i].
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1.
    #
    #Explanation: The provided code snippet aims to find the segment with the maximum sum in the array `arr`. However, the logic within the loop does not correctly update the `max_segment` or `segments_variants` lists. The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are not properly initialized or updated, leading to incorrect results. Given the initial conditions and the logic in the loop, the final state of the variables remains the same as the initial state.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `segments_variants` is now ['new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'], `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [len(arr) - 1]
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over `segments_variants`, which contains a single element 'new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'. Inside the loop, it checks if `total_max_segment[0]` is less than the first element of the current `segment` and if the length of the segment is not 1. Since `total_max_segment` starts as [-1] and the first element of the segment is `len(arr) - 1`, which is greater than -1 (assuming `len(arr) > 1`), `total_max_segment` gets updated to `[len(arr) - 1]`. All other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop's condition or actions.
    return total_max_segment
    #`total_max_segment` is [len(arr) - 1]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers where each element is between -10^9 and 10^9. The function returns the last index of the list (len(arr) - 1).

```

Return Postconditions: `total_max_segment` is [len(arr) - 1]


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
