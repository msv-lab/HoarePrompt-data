The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `number`, which is an integer, and `quantity`, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= quantity <= 2 * 10^5. The function does not have a specific output described directly in the problem statement, but based on the constraints, it implies that the function might perform some operation involving both `number` and `quantity`. However, since no specific operation or return value is mentioned, we can only describe the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` and a non-negative integer `quantity` (where 0 <= quantity <= 2 * 10^5), and it performs an unspecified operation involving both parameters.**
