Output State: **`j` is 107, `k` must be greater than 9, `s` is the string 'iu\ud83d'**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the Unicode code point `j` (which is 107) to the string `s`. The Unicode code point 107 corresponds to the emoji \ud83d. Since `s` initially contains the characters 'i' and 'u', after appending the character, `s` becomes 'iu\ud83d'. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `k` must be greater than 9 is still valid.
