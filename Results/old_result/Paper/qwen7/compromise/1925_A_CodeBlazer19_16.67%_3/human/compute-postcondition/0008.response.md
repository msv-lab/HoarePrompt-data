Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` in the range `range(97, k + 97)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `j` starting from 97 up to `k + 97 - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is the first integer input by the user
   - `k` is the second integer input by the user
   - `s` is the string 'aa'
   - `j` is 98

3. **Check if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, the value of `j` must be within the range specified by the loop head, i.e., `97 <= j < k + 97`. Given that `j` is currently 98, it satisfies the condition as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 97.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `j` is 98, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 99. However, the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is the string 'aa', `j` is 99**
