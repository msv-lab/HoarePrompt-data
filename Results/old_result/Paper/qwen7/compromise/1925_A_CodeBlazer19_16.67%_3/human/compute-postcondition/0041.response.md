Output State: **`j` is 199, `k` is at least 102, `s` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value 199 (`}*`)**

Explanation: 
- The variable `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 199) to itself. The character corresponding to ASCII value 199 is `}*`.
- Since `j` was 199 and `s` was already `}*`, after executing `s += chr(j)`, `s` becomes `}*}*`.
- The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged as the loop condition does not allow another iteration.
