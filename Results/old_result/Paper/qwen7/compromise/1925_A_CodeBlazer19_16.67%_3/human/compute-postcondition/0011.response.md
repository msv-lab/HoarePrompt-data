Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is the string 'aaaaaaaaa', `j` is 105.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = k + 97 - 1`. Since the loop executes 3 times as per the given states, we can infer that it will continue until `j` reaches 105 (since the third iteration sets `j` to 99, and the next iteration would set `j` to 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, and finally 105). Therefore, the string `s` will contain the characters from 'a' to 'j', which is 'aaaaaaaaaa'. However, since the loop stops just before `j` reaches `k + 97`, if `k` is such that `k + 97` is greater than 122 (which is the ASCII value for 'z'), then `s` will stop at the last valid character before exceeding 122. Given the pattern, `s` will be 'aaaaaaaaa' if `k` is such that `k + 97` is between 122 and 123.
