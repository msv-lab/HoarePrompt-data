Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and `t` is now the integer input by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state of `t` is defined as an integer between 1 and 676, after executing the code, `t` will hold the value entered by the user, which must still fall within the range 1 to 676. The other conditions and constraints for `n` and `k` remain unchanged and are still valid.
