Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(97, k + 97)`. This means `j` should be less than `k + 97` for the loop to continue.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 106
   - `k` must be greater than 9
   - `s` is a string containing the characters 'i' and 'u'

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `k + 97`.
   - Given `j` is currently 106, for the loop to continue, `k + 97` must be greater than 106.
   - Since `k` must be greater than 9, let's assume the smallest possible value for `k` that satisfies both conditions. If `k` is just slightly more than 9 (e.g., 10), then `k + 97` would be 107, which is indeed greater than 106.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will increase by 1 in each iteration, so it will become 107.
   - `k` must still be greater than 9 to ensure the loop can continue.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is 107, `k` must be greater than 9, `s` is a string containing the characters 'i' and 'u'**
