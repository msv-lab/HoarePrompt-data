You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The pairs (r_i, c_i) for i-th move you made are valid positions on an n × n chessboard, ensuring no two rooks attack each other before and after each move.
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `dp` will contain [12828, 1070834], with `i` being 9.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break down the process:
    #
    #1. Initially, `dp` starts as `[1, 1]`.
    #2. After the first iteration (`i=3`), `dp` becomes `[1, 6]`.
    #3. After the second iteration (`i=5`), `dp` becomes `[6, 28]`.
    #4. After the third iteration (`i=7`), `dp` becomes `[28, 214]`.
    #
    #Following the pattern, we can see that each new element added to `dp` is calculated based on the last two elements of `dp`. Specifically, the formula used is `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
    #
    #For the fourth iteration (`i=9`):
    #- The new element will be `(214 + 2 * (9 - 1) * 28) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = (214 + 2 * 8 * 28) % (1000000007) = (214 + 448) % 1000000007 = 662 % 1000000007 = 662`.
    #- The updated `dp` will then be `[28, 214, 662]`.
    #
    #For the fifth iteration (`i=11`):
    #- The new element will be `(662 + 2 * (11 - 1) * 214) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = (662 + 2 * 10 * 214) % 1000000007 = (662 + 4280) % 1000000007 = 4942 % 1000000007 = 4942`.
    #- The updated `dp` will then be `[214, 662, 4942]`.
    #
    #Continuing this pattern until the loop completes, the final state of `dp` after all iterations will be `[12828, 1070834]`, with `i` being 9.
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns 1070834
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer n and returns the value 1070834.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 1070834

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
