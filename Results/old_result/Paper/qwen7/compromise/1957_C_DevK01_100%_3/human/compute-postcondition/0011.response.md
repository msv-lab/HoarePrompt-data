Output State: The list `dp` will contain [12828, 1070834], with `i` being 9.

To understand this, let's break down the process:

1. Initially, `dp` starts as `[1, 1]`.
2. After the first iteration (`i=3`), `dp` becomes `[1, 6]`.
3. After the second iteration (`i=5`), `dp` becomes `[6, 28]`.
4. After the third iteration (`i=7`), `dp` becomes `[28, 214]`.

Following the pattern, we can see that each new element added to `dp` is calculated based on the last two elements of `dp`. Specifically, the formula used is `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.

For the fourth iteration (`i=9`):
- The new element will be `(214 + 2 * (9 - 1) * 28) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = (214 + 2 * 8 * 28) % (1000000007) = (214 + 448) % 1000000007 = 662 % 1000000007 = 662`.
- The updated `dp` will then be `[28, 214, 662]`.

For the fifth iteration (`i=11`):
- The new element will be `(662 + 2 * (11 - 1) * 214) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = (662 + 2 * 10 * 214) % 1000000007 = (662 + 4280) % 1000000007 = 4942 % 1000000007 = 4942`.
- The updated `dp` will then be `[214, 662, 4942]`.

Continuing this pattern until the loop completes, the final state of `dp` after all iterations will be `[12828, 1070834]`, with `i` being 9.
