Output State: The list `dp` will contain [214, 1806], with `i` being 9.

Explanation: The loop continues to append new values to the `dp` list based on the formula provided. Starting from the given state after 3 iterations (`dp = [28, 214], i = 7`), we can see that each new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. After the 4th iteration, `dp` becomes `[214, 1806]`, and `i` becomes 9.
