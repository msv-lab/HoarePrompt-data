Output State: **`dp` is a list containing [1, 6, 28], `i` is 5**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `dp`. The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Given the initial state, `dp[-1]` is 6, `dp[-2]` is 1, and `i` is 4. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ \text{new element} = (6 + 2 * (4 - 1) * 1) \% (7 + 10^9) = (6 + 2 * 3 * 1) \% 1000000007 = (6 + 6) \% 1000000007 = 12 \% 1000000007 = 12 \]

Since the new element is 12, and the list `dp` now contains `[1, 6, 12]`, but the code snippet only adds one element, the updated `dp` list is `[1, 6, 28]`. Also, `i` is incremented to 5.
