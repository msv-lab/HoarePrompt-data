The function processes a single test case consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. It constructs a list `v` based on the input and checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies and uses the list `v` to determine the output.
