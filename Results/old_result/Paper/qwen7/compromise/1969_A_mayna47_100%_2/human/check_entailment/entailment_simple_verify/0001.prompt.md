You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `v` is a list of length n+1 where the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are integers from the input split and converted to int. The value printed is either 2 or nothing, depending on whether the condition `v[v[i]] == i` is met for any `i` in the range 1 to n. If the condition is met for any `i`, then 2 is printed; otherwise, nothing is printed.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop.
   - This suggests there might be a missing call to `func_1()` inside the loop.

3. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, it initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It updates `v` to include the best friends' indices.
   - It then checks if any pair of friends are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`).
     - If such a pair exists, it prints `2` and returns, indicating only 2 invitations are needed.
   - If no such pair exists, it prints `3`, indicating 3 invitations are needed.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and ensures that if such a pair exists, only 2 invitations are required.
   - However, the logic assumes that if no such pair exists, 3 invitations are always needed, which might not be true in all cases.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `5` (number of friends), `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]` (best friends).
   - Expected Output: `2` (since friends 4 and 5 are each other's best friends).

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `4` (number of friends), `[2, 3, 4, 1]` (best friends).
   - Expected Output: `3` (since no pair of friends are each other's best friends, and we need to invite at least one more friend to ensure at least 2 friends come).

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2` (number of friends), `[2, 1]` (best friends).
   - Expected Output: `2` (since friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends).

### Issues Identified

- The function `func_1()` is not being called in the main loop.
- The logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is flawed because it assumes 3 invitations are always needed if no pair of friends are each other's best friends. This is not necessarily true.

### Corrected Program

To fix the issues, we need to:
1. Call `func_1()` inside the main loop.
2. Ensure the logic correctly handles cases where no pair of friends are each other's best friends.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    found_pair = False
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            found_pair = True
            break
    if found_pair:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(3)
```

### Conclusion

After making these corrections, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.
