Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
3. The program initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it with the values from the input list `p`.
4. The program then checks for each friend `i` if `v[v[i]] == i`. If this condition is true for any `i`, it prints `2` because both `i` and `v[i]` would be invited, and both would come to the party.
5. If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
- The program does not handle the case where no pair `i` and `v[i]` exists such that `v[v[i]] == i`. In such cases, it should print `3` but the current implementation prints `3` unconditionally after the loop.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple pairs exist, which could potentially allow for fewer than 3 invitations to be sent.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
