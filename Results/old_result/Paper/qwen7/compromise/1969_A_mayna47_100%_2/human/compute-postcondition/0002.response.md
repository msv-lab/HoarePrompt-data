Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is an integer from the input split and converted to int, with the first element being 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `v` by converting the input into a list of integers and concatenating it with `[0]`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. The new list `v` now starts with `0` followed by the integers from the input.
