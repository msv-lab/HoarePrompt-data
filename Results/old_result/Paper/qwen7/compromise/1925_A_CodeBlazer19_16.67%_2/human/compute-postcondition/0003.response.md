Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `s`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, their conditions and values remain unchanged.
