Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = ''
    for j in range(97, k + 97):
        s += chr(j)
    if k == 1:
        print(n * s)
    else:
        print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k + 97 * 9 = k + 873` is the valid upper bound, `s` is a string consisting of 9 'a's, and `j` is 195.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 2, `k` is 1 or greater than or equal to 195 (since the loop runs from 97 to k + 97, and it executes 98 times if k is 194 but not 1), `s` is a string containing characters from 'ù' to 'ý' (which are the characters corresponding to ASCII values from 128 to 255), `j` is 195 at the start of each iteration but changes within the loop, and `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 99, `s` is a string consisting of 95 'û' characters, `j` is 291, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `k` equals 1, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
