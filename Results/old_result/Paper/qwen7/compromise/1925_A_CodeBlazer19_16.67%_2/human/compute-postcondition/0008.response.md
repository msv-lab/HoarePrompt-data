Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `k + 97`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `97` to `k + 97`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `k + 97`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k + 97` is a valid upper bound.
   - `s` is 'aa'.
   - `j` is 98.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 98, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `k + 97`.
   - Given that `j` is 98, the next value of `j` would be 99.
   - Therefore, `k + 97` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains the same: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676.
   - `i` remains the same: `i` is 1.
   - `n` remains the same: `n` is an input integer.
   - `k + 97` remains the same: `k + 97` is a valid upper bound.
   - `s` remains the same: `s` is 'aa'.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 99.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k + 97` is a valid upper bound, `s` is 'aa', `j` is 99**
