Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state of `t` was a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), after executing the code, `t` retains its constraint but now holds the specific integer value input by the user. All other conditions and constraints on `t` remain valid.
