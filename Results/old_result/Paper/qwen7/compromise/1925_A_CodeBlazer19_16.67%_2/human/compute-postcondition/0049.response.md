Output State: `t` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` is an input integer greater than 99, `s` is a string consisting of 95 'รป' characters, `j` is 291, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`, meaning the loop has run `t` times. Given the constraints, `t` can be any value from 3 to 676. The variable `k` is not directly modified by the loop itself but is an input that must be greater than 99 for the loop to produce the described output (since the loop runs 95 times when `k` is 100). The string `s` consists of 95 'รป' characters because the loop runs 95 times when `k` is greater than 99. The variable `j` starts at 291 (97 + 194) and does not change within the loop body since the loop ends before `j` reaches its next value. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
