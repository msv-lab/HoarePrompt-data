### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences of `s`.
   - The goal is to minimize the length of `s`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `n` copies of `s`. Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - When `k == 1`, the string `s` will be a single character repeated `n` times.
     - This is correct because the only possible string of length `n` using one character is that character repeated `n` times.
   - **Case 2: `k > 1`**
     - The string `s` constructed by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets ensures that all possible strings of length `n` using these `k` characters can be found as subsequences.
     - However, the logic `(2 - (n == 1)) * s` is problematic:
       - If `n == 1`, it should print `s` once, but the code prints `s` twice.
       - If `n > 1`, it prints `s` twice, which is unnecessary and does not minimize the length of `s`.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - For `k == 1`, the correct output should be `s` repeated `n` times.
   - For `k > 1`, the correct output should be `s` repeated enough times to ensure all possible strings of length `n` are covered.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly handle the case when `n == 1` for `k > 1`. It prints `s` twice instead of just once.

### Correctness:
**False**
