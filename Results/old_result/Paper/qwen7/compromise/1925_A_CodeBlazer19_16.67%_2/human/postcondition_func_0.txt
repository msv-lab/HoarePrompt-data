The function processes multiple test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs a string `s` containing 95 characters, each being the character corresponding to ASCII values from 97 to `k + 97`. If `k` equals 1, it prints `n` multiplied by the string `s`. Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1))` multiplied by the string `s`. The function returns nothing but prints the results for each test case.
