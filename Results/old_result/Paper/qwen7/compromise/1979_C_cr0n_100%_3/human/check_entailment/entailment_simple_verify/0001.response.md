### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula:
  \[
  \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)}
  \]
- This implementation is accurate and correctly returns the LCM.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Reading**:
  - Reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
  - Initializes `den` with the first multiplier value.

- **LCM Calculation**:
  - Iterates through all multipliers and updates `den` using `func_1` to find the least common multiple of all multipliers.
  - This ensures that `den` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all multipliers.

- **Bet Distribution**:
  - Computes `vprod` as `den // r` for each multiplier `r`, ensuring that the total bet is evenly distributed among the multipliers.
  - Checks if `den - sum(vprod)` is greater than 0. If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
  - Otherwise, it prints the bets as a space-separated string of integers.

#### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Multiplier Calculation**:
   - The initialization of `den` with the first multiplier is correct.
   - Using `func_1` to update `den` by finding the LCM of all multipliers is also correct because the LCM ensures that the total bet is a multiple of each individual bet required to match the multipliers.

2. **Bet Distribution**:
   - The computation of `vprod` as `den // r` for each multiplier `r` is correct because it ensures that the total bet is evenly distributed among the multipliers.
   - The check `den - sum(vprod)` is necessary to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.
   - The program outputs the correct bets when a valid distribution exists.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles cases where the sum of `vprod` equals `den`, resulting in a non-positive value for `den - sum(vprod)`, which triggers the `-1` output.
- The program correctly handles cases where a valid distribution exists by ensuring the total bet is strictly less than the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets.

### Conclusion:

After re-evaluating the program, we confirm that the given program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets. The program handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
