Output State: **`den` is equal to the result of applying `func_1` successively to the first element of `vals` and each subsequent element in `vals`; `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of dividing `den` by each corresponding element in `vals`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension where each element in `vprod` is calculated as `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`. Here, `den` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is the result of applying `func_1` successively to the elements of `vals`. The new variable `vprod` is created with each element being the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`.
