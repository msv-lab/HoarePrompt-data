Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, and the new list `vals` is populated with integers from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `vals`. The value of `N` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The precondition that `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20 remains valid. The new list `vals` is updated with the integers from the input.
