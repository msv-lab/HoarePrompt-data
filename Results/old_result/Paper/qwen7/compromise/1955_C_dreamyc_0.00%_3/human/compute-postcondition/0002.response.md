Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k and len(nums) >= 2`.

2. **Analyze the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `k`: This variable must be non-zero (`k > 0`) for the loop to continue.
   - `len(nums)`: This must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
   - `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `ans` is 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For `k` to be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0.
   - For `len(nums)` to be at least 2, `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

Since `t`, `n`, and `ans` do not affect the loop condition directly, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `ans` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2**
