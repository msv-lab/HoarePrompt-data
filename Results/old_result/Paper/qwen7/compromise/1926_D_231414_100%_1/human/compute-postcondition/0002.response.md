Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `times`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `times` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t` and `check`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `times` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
