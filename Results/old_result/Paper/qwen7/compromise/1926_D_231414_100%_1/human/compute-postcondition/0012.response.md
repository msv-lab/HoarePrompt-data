Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a non-empty list of integers, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647, `s` is `i` XOR `check`, the value of `dic[i]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `dic[i] -= 1` decrements the value of `dic[i]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
