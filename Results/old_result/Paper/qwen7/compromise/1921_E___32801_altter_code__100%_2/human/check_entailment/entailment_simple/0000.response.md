Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by splitting the input into the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. This part is correct.

2. **Base Case for Draw**: The program correctly handles the base case where Bob is in the first row (`x2 <= x1`). In this case, it immediately prints "Draw" and returns, which is correct according to the rules.

3. **Odd Difference in X-coordinates**:
   - The program checks if the difference between the X-coordinates of Bob and Alice is odd. If true, it proceeds to check if Alice can win by moving her chip to a position where she can capture Bob's chip. The logic here seems to be correct, but it needs to ensure that Alice can indeed make a move that leads to capturing Bob's chip within the constraints of the board.

4. **Even Difference in X-coordinates**:
   - If the difference in X-coordinates is even, the program checks if Bob can win similarly. Again, the logic seems to be correct in ensuring that Bob can capture Alice's chip under the given constraints.

5. **Edge Cases and Moves**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when Alice and Bob are on the same Y-coordinate and when the Y-moves are adjusted based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob. These adjustments seem to follow the rules of the game correctly.

6. **Return Statements**:
   - The program uses return statements appropriately to exit the function early when a winner is determined or a draw is identified. This ensures that the function does not continue unnecessary computations once a conclusion is reached.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to handle all the cases correctly based on the problem description and the provided execution states. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
