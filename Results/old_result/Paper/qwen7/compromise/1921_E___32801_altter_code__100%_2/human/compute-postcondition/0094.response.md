Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers `[n, m, x1 + a, y1, x2 - a, y2]`.
- `b` is the difference between `x2 - a` and `x1`, so \(b = (x2 - a) - x1\).
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, so \(t = |y2 - y1|\).
- `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, and `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
- The conditions also include:
  - \(b // 2 \leq a\)
  - \(|x2 - c| < x1 + c\) (assuming `c` is some constant, but its value is not specified, so we cannot determine its impact on the outcome directly)
  - \(y1 > y2\)
  - At least one of \((1 > y1 > m)\) or \((1 > x1 > n)\) is true.

Given these conditions, the print statement is simply:

```python
print('draw')
```

This statement will print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **'draw'**
