Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the relevant information:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers \([n, m, x1 + a, y, x2 - a, y2]\).
- `b` is the value of \((x2 - a) - x1\), and it is given that this difference is even.
- `y` is either \(y2 - 1\) or \(0\), depending on whether \(y2 \leq y1\) or not.
- `t` is equal to the absolute value of \(1 - y1\) if \(y2 \leq y1\), and it is equal to the absolute value of \(y2 - y1\) if \(y2 > y1\).
- `c` is either \(y1 - 1\) or \(m - y1\), depending on the same condition as above.
- The condition \((x2 > x1 \text{ and } x1 \geq 1 \text{ and } x2 \leq n)\) holds.
- \((b // 2 > a)\) and \(\text{abs}(x2 - c) \geq x1 + c\) are true.
- The conditions \((1 \leq y1 \leq m)\) and \((1 \leq x1 \leq n)\) hold.

Given the `print('Alice')` statement, we need to determine what is printed. The string `'Alice'` is directly provided in the `print` statement, and no other variables or expressions are evaluated within the `print` function. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
