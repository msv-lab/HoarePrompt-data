Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1+1, y1-1, x2, y2], where n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, x2 is greater than x1, and the difference (x2 - x1) is odd, and y1 is now equal to y2 - 1**

Explanation: The value of `x1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x2`, `y2`, and the relationship between `x1` and `y1`.
