Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding an array \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) such that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution initializes \(a[0] = 500\).
   - For each subsequent element \(a[i]\), it sets \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\).
   - This approach does not necessarily satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- For the input:
  ```
  4
  2 4 1
  ```
- The expected output is:
  ```
  3 5 4 9
  ```

However, the given solution would produce:
- \(a[0] = 500\)
- \(a[1] = 500 + 2 = 502\)
- \(a[2] = 502 + 4 = 506\)
- \(a[3] = 506 + 1 = 507\)

Clearly, \(502 \bmod 500 \neq 2\), \(506 \bmod 502 \neq 4\), and \(507 \bmod 506 \neq 1\). Therefore, the solution does not correctly satisfy the problem constraints.

Correctness: **False**
