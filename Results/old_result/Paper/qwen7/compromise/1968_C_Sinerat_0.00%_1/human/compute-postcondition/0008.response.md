Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.

The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since the initial state already defines the relationship between the elements of list `a` and the list `x`, the updated relationship remains the same. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code.
