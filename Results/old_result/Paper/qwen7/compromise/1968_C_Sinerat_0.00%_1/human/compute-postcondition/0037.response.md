Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[2]` is equal to `a[1] + x[1]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3

6. **Consider the array `a` and list `x`**: The given information does not indicate any changes to `a` or `x` within the loop. Therefore, we do not need to update these states.

Based on the above steps, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
