Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[i]` is equal to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`. The list `a` will have its last element updated to the sum of the second last element of `a` and the second last element of `x`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be `n-1`, the input integer `n` must still be greater than 1, and the last element of the list `a` will be the sum of the second last element of `a` and the second last element of `x`.
