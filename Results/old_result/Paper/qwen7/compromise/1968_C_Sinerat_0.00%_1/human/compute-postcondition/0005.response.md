Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts with `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `a` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `a[0]` is 500.

Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, and `i` is already set to 1, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `a[0]` is 500**
