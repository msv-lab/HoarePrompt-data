Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[2]` is equal to `a[1] + x[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` becomes `a[2]`, which is now equal to `a[1] + x[1]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
