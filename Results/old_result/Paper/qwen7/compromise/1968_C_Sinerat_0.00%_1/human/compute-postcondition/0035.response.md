Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State After the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `a[0] + x[0]`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Check the State of `a[i]`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `a[1]` is equal to `a[0] + x[0]`.
   - This value does not change within the loop itself, so it remains the same.

6. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `a[1]` remains equal to `a[0] + x[0]`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[1]` is equal to `a[0] + x[0]`**.
