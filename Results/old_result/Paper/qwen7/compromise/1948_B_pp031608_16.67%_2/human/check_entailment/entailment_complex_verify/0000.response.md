### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous element and the previous element is greater than or equal to 10, it performs the digit-splitting operation.
   - The digit-splitting operation involves popping the previous element, dividing it by 10 to get the first digit, and inserting the first digit before the current element, followed by the remainder of the division (the second digit).

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After potentially performing the digit-splitting operation, the program calls `func_1` to check if the array is now sorted.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply checks if the array is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version.

### Key Points to Evaluate:

- **Digit-Splitting Operation**: The program correctly identifies when to perform the digit-splitting operation and does so correctly.
- **Sorting Check**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like arrays that are already sorted or need multiple digit-splitting operations.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```

1. **Initial Array**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
2. **First Iteration**:
   - Compare `45` and `3`: `45 > 3` and `45 >= 10`, so we perform the digit-splitting operation.
   - After splitting `45` into `4` and `5`, the array becomes `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
3. **Second Iteration**:
   - Compare `5` and `67`: `5 < 67`, so no further operations are needed.
4. **Check Sorted Order**:
   - The array `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]` is now sorted, so the program prints "Yes".

This example demonstrates that the program correctly identifies when to perform the digit-splitting operation and correctly checks if the array is sorted after the operations.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. However, upon detailed analysis, the program does correctly implement the digit-splitting operation and checks if the array is sorted. The original assessment is **inaccurate**.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
