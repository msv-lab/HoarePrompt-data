Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the values of `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`**.

This means that the function `func_1()` has been called, and it has returned two values: `n` and `k`. These returned values replace the existing `n` and `k` in the initial state, while the precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n remains valid.
