Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `arr = func_2()` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the return values of `func_1()`. Therefore, `n` and `k` retain their original values, and `arr` now holds the return value from `func_2()`.
