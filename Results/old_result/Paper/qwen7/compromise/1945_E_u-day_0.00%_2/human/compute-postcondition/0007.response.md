Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`; `st` is an empty set.**

The code creates an empty set named `st`, which was not previously defined. The values of `low`, `high`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial states.
