Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins for cow `k`. Specifically, the function `func_1` has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Winning Matches:**
   - The function `func_1` tries to find the first two positions where the cow at position `k` can lose, but this approach is flawed. It should instead focus on finding the best possible sequence of wins.
   - The function incorrectly breaks the loop after finding the first two positions where the cow can lose, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it does not correctly account for the scenario where the cow at position `k` can win all matches if it is placed in a favorable position.

3. **Logic for Returning Results:**
   - The logic for returning the number of wins is also incorrect. It does not always provide the optimal solution.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    cow_ratings = sorted([(rating, i) for i, rating in enumerate(l)], reverse=True)
    
    def count_wins(pos):
        wins = 0
        for i, (rating, orig_pos) in enumerate(cow_ratings):
            if orig_pos == pos:
                continue
            if rating > l[pos]:
                wins += 1
            else:
                break
        return wins
    
    # Case 1: Do nothing
    max_wins = count_wins(k)
    
    # Case 2: Swap with the cow in position 1
    if k > 0:
        max_wins = max(max_wins, count_wins(0))
    
    print(max_wins)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Sorting Ratings and Positions:**
   - We sort the cows based on their ratings in descending order while keeping track of their original positions.
   
2. **Counting Wins:**
   - We define a helper function `count_wins` that counts how many matches a cow at a given position can win.
   - We iterate through the sorted list of cows and count the number of wins until we encounter a cow with a higher rating.

3. **Comparing Two Scenarios:**
   - We compare the number of wins if the cow does nothing versus if it swaps with the cow in position 1.
   - We print the maximum number of wins from these two scenarios.

This solution ensures that the program correctly finds the maximum number of wins for the specified cow.
