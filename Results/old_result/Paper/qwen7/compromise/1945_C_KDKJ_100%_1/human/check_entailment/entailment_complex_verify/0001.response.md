### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied. The satisfaction is determined by the number of residents wanting to live on the left (`0`) or right (`1`).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function processes a single test case.
     - It reads the number of houses `n` and the binary string `a`.
     - It calculates the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s up to each house using a list `S`.
     - It iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road there satisfies the conditions.
     - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of unsatisfied residents on the left and right sides.
     - If the conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position is closer to the middle of the village.
   - **func_2()**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Initialization and Cumulative Counts**: The code correctly initializes the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s.
     - The list `S` is initialized with `[0, 0]` and updated in each iteration to keep track of the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s.
   - **Condition Checking**: The conditions for satisfaction are correctly checked using the cumulative counts.
     - The condition `left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - **Optimization**: The function correctly updates the answer `ans` to be the position closest to the middle of the village while satisfying the conditions.
     - The condition `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)` ensures that the chosen position `i` is the closest to the middle of the village.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when the entire village is on one side (`000` or `111`), ensuring the road is placed optimally.
     - For example, if the entire village is on the left side (`000`), the function correctly places the road after the first house, and if the entire village is on the right side (`111`), the function correctly places the road before the first house.

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` correctly processes each test case, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
