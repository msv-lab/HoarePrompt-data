Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It reads an integer from user input, which specifies the number of times to call the `func_1` function. After calling `func_1` the specified number of times, the function ensures that the string `a` remains unchanged and consists of '0' and '1' characters, with a length between 3 and 300,000 inclusive.**
