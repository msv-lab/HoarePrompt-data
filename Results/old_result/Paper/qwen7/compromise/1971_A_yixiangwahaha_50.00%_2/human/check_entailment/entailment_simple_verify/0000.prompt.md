You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4

    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9

- Program: 
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive; `x` is a list with 10 elements, each element is an integer; `y` is a list with 10 elements, each element is an integer.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 10 lines, each line containing two integers separated by a space. For each iteration `i` from 0 to 9, if the value of `x[i]` is less than the value of `y[i]`, the line will display `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, it will display `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line contains a single integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the program reads `t` from the first line but then attempts to read 10 pairs of integers regardless of the value of `t`. This will lead to incorrect behavior if `t` is not equal to 10. For example, if `t` is 5, the program will still attempt to process 10 pairs of integers, leading to incorrect results.
