Reasoning:
- The problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the provided code only processes one set of 10 pairs of integers.
- The input handling in the code is hardcoded to read exactly 10 pairs, which does not match the problem statement that specifies reading a variable number of test cases (up to 100).
- The code should use a loop to process each test case individually, rather than hardcoding the number of iterations.
- The logic for determining the minimum and maximum values is correct, but the input and output handling need to be adjusted to match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you should modify it to handle the number of test cases specified in the input and ensure it correctly processes each test case. Here's an example of how you could modify the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')  # Read a pair of integers
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

# Example usage:
func()
```

This corrected version will correctly handle the number of test cases and process each pair of integers as required by the problem statement.
