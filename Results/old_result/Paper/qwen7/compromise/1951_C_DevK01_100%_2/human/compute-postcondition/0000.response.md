Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is now the input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now `t` specifically holds the value of the input integer.
