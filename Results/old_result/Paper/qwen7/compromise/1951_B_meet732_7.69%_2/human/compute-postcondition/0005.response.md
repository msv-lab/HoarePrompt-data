Output State: `ind` is a list containing indices of at most two elements from list `a` where the elements are greater than `x`, `a` remains a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of n cows, `k` remains an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `x` is the k-th element of list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 (if exactly one element greater than `x` is found before `c` reaches 2).
