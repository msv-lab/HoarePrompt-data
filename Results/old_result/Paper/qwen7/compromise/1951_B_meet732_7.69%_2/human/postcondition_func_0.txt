The function processes a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of `n` cows and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. It identifies indices of at most two elements in `a` that are greater than the `k`-th element of `a`. Based on specific conditions, it returns one of the following values: `n - 1`, `13`, a value that is 1 less than the first index of a greater element (if it is greater than 14), the maximum difference between `k` and the first index of a greater element or between the first index and 1, the minimum value between the second index of a greater element minus 1 and 13, the maximum difference between the first and second index of greater elements, or the maximum difference between the first index and `k`.
