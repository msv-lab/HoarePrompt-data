### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze the function `func_1` and the given example in detail to confirm the assessment.

#### Function Analysis

1. **Identifying Greater Elements**:
   - The function `func_1` tries to identify up to two indices where the elements are greater than the `k`-th element.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible swaps and their outcomes.

2. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns different values based on specific conditions, but these conditions do not cover all possible scenarios.
   - For example, it does not consider the optimal swap strategy, which is crucial for maximizing the number of wins.

#### Example Analysis

Let's re-examine the provided example:

- Input: `6 5`
- Ratings: `[7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]`

**Current Program Output**:
- The function `func_1` will identify indices where the ratings are greater than 12 (the rating of cow 5).
- It finds indices 2 and 3 (ratings 727 and 13).
- Depending on the conditions, it returns a value that does not necessarily represent the maximum number of wins.

**Optimal Strategy**:
- Swapping cow 5 with cow 3 (rating 727) results in the sequence `[7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]`.
- Cow 5 (now at position 3) wins the first match against cow 2.
- Cow 5 then wins the second match against cow 10.
- Cow 5 then loses the third match against cow 727.
- Thus, cow 5 can win 2 matches by swapping with cow 3.

The current implementation does not account for this optimal swap strategy. Instead, it returns a fixed value based on the positions and ratings, which may not always be the maximum number of wins.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, as it does not consider all possible swaps and their outcomes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
