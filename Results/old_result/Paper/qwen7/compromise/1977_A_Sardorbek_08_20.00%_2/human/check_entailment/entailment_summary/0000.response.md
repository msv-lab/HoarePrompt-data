Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Input Parsing**: It correctly parses the values of `b` and `c` for each test case.
3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The condition `if b == c:` is correct; if the number of moves `b` equals the desired number of cubes `c`, Nikita can indeed achieve the goal, so printing 'YES' is correct.
   - The condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that fewer moves than needed cannot result in the desired number of cubes. This should be handled differently.
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect and irrelevant. The variable `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves `b`. This condition does not make sense in the context of the problem.
   - The final `else:` block is also incorrect and redundant since it does not cover all necessary conditions.

Given the requirements, the correct logic should be:
- If `b == c`, print 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, print 'NO' because it's impossible to add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `b > c`, check if `(b - c)` is even because each move can either add or remove one cube, meaning the difference must be even to balance out.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

Based on the above analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
