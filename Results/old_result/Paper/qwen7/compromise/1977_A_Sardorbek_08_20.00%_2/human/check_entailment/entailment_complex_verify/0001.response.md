### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the logical flaws in the provided program. Specifically, the conditions involving `a % 2` were incorrect and unnecessary. The revised program provided in the assessment addresses these issues by checking if the number of moves (`b`) is at least equal to the desired number of cubes (`c`) and if the difference between `b` and `c` is even.

However, let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure the logic is sound:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and processes each test case.
   
2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Conditions to Check**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0`
     - This condition ensures that the number of moves `b` is at least equal to the desired number of cubes `c` and that the difference between `b` and `c` is even. This is correct because:
       - `b >= c` ensures that there are enough moves to achieve the desired number of cubes.
       - `(b - c) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which means the operations (adding or removing one cube per move) can balance out to achieve the exact number of cubes.

### Correct Conditions:
- The condition `b >= c` ensures that there are enough moves to achieve the desired number of cubes.
- The condition `(b - c) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, allowing for a balanced set of additions and subtractions.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the logical flaws in the provided program. The revised program provided in the assessment is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
