You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration from 0 to a-1. The specific sequence of these outputs depends on the values of b and c entered during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple pairs of positive integers (b, c) within the range of 1 to 100. For each pair, it checks the relationship between b and c and prints one of four possible responses: 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. The final state of the program consists of a series of these printed responses, one for each input pair.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `a` times, processing each test case.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It stores these values in a tuple `q = (b, c)`.

3. **Conditions to Check**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if b == c`
     - If the number of moves `b` equals the desired number of cubes `c`, then it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif b < c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than moves.
   - **Condition 3**: `elif a % 2 == b % 2`
     - This condition checks if the number of moves `b` is even or odd and compares it with the number of test cases `a`. However, this logic is flawed. The parity of `a` (number of test cases) does not affect the possibility of ending up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.
   - **Condition 4**: `else`
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'. This is incorrect because the logic in Condition 3 is flawed and should not be used.

### Correct Conditions:
- To correctly determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves, we need to check if `b` is at least equal to `c` and if the difference between `b` and `c` is even (since each move either adds or removes one cube).

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical flaws in its conditions, particularly in the use of `a % 2` and the handling of the parity check. The revised program correctly checks if the number of moves is sufficient and if the difference between moves and desired cubes is even.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
