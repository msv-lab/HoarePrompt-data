Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop from `0` to `a-1`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **Condition 1:** `b == c`
     - If the number of moves (`b`) equals the desired number of cubes (`c`), it prints 'YES'. This condition is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means all moves were additions.
   - **Condition 2:** `b < c`
     - If the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it's possible to have fewer moves but still achieve the desired number of cubes through a combination of additions and removals.
   - **Condition 3:** `a % 2 == b % 2`
     - This condition checks if the number of moves (`b`) is even or odd. However, this does not correctly determine if the desired number of cubes can be achieved. The parity (even/odd nature) of the number of moves does not directly relate to whether the final number of cubes can match `c`.
   - **Else Condition:**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'. This is also incorrect because there might be other combinations of additions and removals that could result in the desired number of cubes.

### Correct Conditions:
- To correctly determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves, we need to check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even. This is because each move (addition or removal) changes the count by 1, and the parity of the difference must be zero for the final count to match `c`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in checking the conditions. The corrected program should check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even.

**Correctness: False**
