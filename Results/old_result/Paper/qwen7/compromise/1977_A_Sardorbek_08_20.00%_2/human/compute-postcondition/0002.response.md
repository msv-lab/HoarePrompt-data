Output State: **The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration from 0 to a-1. The specific sequence of these outputs depends on the values of b and c entered during each iteration.**

This means that for each iteration of the loop (from 0 to a-1), the program reads two integers \(b\) and \(c\) from the user, checks the conditions, and prints one of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. The exact sequence of these outputs will vary depending on the inputs provided for \(b\) and \(c\) in each iteration.
