Output State: `t` is the final value of `t` after all iterations of the loop have executed, based on the given operations and conditions within the loop. The value of `t` is determined by the inputs `a` and `b` for each iteration of the loop, and it is updated according to the specified rules. The initial value of `t` from the precondition is modified by these operations, and the final value of `t` after all iterations is the output state.
