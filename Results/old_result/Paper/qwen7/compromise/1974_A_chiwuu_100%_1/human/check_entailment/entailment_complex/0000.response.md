Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `n`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - `t` is initially set to `b`, which represents the number of 2x2 icons.
   - If `b` is even, `t` is divided by 2. If `b` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and then incremented by 1. This calculation determines how many full 2x2 grids (each occupying 4 cells) can be placed on the screens.

3. **Remaining Cells**:
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining number of cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there are enough cells to place all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens. In this case, `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the number of additional screens needed is calculated. The remaining 1x1 icons (`a - t1`) are divided by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells), and if there is any remainder, an additional screen is needed.

4. **Output**: The final value of `t` is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons. The calculations ensure that the number of 2x2 icons is optimally placed first, and then the remaining space is used for 1x1 icons.

Therefore, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
