### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description and Constraints:
- We need to place \(x\) icons of size \(1 \times 1\) and \(y\) icons of size \(2 \times 2\) on the minimum number of screens.
- Each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5 rows * 3 columns).

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of screens needed based on the given \(x\) and \(y\).
- The logic involves some arithmetic operations to determine the number of screens required.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   for i in range(n):
       (a, b) = input().split()
       a = int(a)
       b = int(b)
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case.

2. **Calculation of Screens:**
   ```python
   t = b
   if t % 2 == 0:
       t = t // 2
   else:
       t = t // 2 + 1
   t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
   if t1 >= a:
       t = t
   else:
       t2 = a - t1
       if t2 % 15 == 0:
           t = t + t2 // 15
       else:
           t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
   print(t)
   ```

   - **Step 1:** Initialize `t` with the number of 2x2 icons.
   - **Step 2:** Adjust `t` based on whether it is even or odd.
   - **Step 3:** Calculate the available space on the screen after placing the 2x2 icons (`t1`).
   - **Step 4:** Check if the remaining space can accommodate the 1x1 icons. If not, adjust the number of screens accordingly.

#### Verification Against Examples:
Let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon. The 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for the 1x1 icon. Hence, one screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Seven 1x1 icons and two 2x2 icons. Two 2x2 icons take 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for the 1x1 icons. Hence, one screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Twelve 1x1 icons and four 2x2 icons. Four 2x2 icons take 16 cells, which is more than the 15 cells available on one screen. Hence, two screens are required.
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `0 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Three 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, totaling 12 cells, which fits within one screen.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `1 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One 1x1 icon and no 2x2 icons. One 1x1 icon fits within one screen.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `8 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Eight 1x1 icons and one 2x2 icon. The 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for the 1x1 icons. Hence, one screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No icons. No screens are needed.
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

8. **Example 8:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Two 1x1 icons and no 2x2 icons. Two 1x1 icons fit within one screen.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

9. **Example 9:**
   - Input: `15 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Fifteen 1x1 icons and no 2x2 icons. Fifteen 1x1 icons fit within one screen.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

10. **Example 10:**
    - Input: `8 2`
    - Expected Output: `2`
    - Explanation: Eight 1x1 icons and two 2x2 icons. Two 2x2 icons take 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for the 1x1 icons. Hence, two screens are required.
    - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

11. **Example 11:**
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Expected Output: `3`
    - Explanation: Nine 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, totaling 36 cells, which requires three screens.
    - Program Output: `3` (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case based on the given inputs. The logic in the program matches the problem description and the provided examples.

### Final Evaluation:
