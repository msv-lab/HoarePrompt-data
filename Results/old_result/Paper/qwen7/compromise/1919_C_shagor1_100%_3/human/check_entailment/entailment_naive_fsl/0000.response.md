Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for updating `la` and `lb` and counting the penalty is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
2 1 3 2
```

The expected output should be 1 because the optimal split would be `s = [2, 2]` and `t = [1, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 1 = 1`.

However, the program will incorrectly output 2 because it does not properly handle the sequence to minimize the penalty. The program updates `la` and `lb` based on the current element but does not ensure that the splits are valid subsequences as defined in the problem statement. This leads to incorrect penalty calculations in certain scenarios.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
