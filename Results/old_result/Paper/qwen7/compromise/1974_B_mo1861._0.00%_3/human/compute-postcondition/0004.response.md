Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the position of the character in the sorted set. Specifically, the last character in the sorted set is mapped to 'a', the second last to 'b', and so on.
