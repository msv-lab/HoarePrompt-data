Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `c`, `b`, and the operations performed within the loop head are `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the set `set(b)` after sorting it.

3. **Determine the initial state adjustments needed**:
   - `char_map`: This is given as an empty dictionary and does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `b`: This is the original list or iterable that gets transformed into a sorted set. For the loop to execute, `b` must contain at least one unique element because `set(b)` will be empty if `b` is empty.
   - `i` and `c`: These are the variables used in the loop. `i` is the index, and `c` is the character from the sorted set of unique elements in `b`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `b` contains at least one unique element so that `set(b)` is not empty, and thus the loop can execute. 

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
- If `b` is an empty list or contains no unique elements, `set(b)` will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- Therefore, we need to ensure that `b` has at least one unique element.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `char_map` remains an empty dictionary.
- `b` must contain at least one unique element.

So, the state adjustment required is:

**State: **`char_map` is an empty dictionary, `b` must contain at least one unique element**.
