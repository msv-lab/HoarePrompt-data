Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires decoding an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters from `s` in sorted order and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding character from the end of `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function `func_1` should reverse the encoding process.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `b` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of `r`.
   - For each character in `b`, it uses this map to find the original character in `s`.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly sorts the unique characters of `b` and maps each character to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted list.
   - The mapping logic is correct because it uses the index of the character in the sorted list to determine its position from the end.
   - The decoding process iterates through each character in `b` and uses the `char_map` to construct the original string `s`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles strings of varying lengths and compositions correctly.
   - The use of `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` ensures that the mapping is done correctly, considering the zero-based index.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected outputs when decoded using the given function.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
