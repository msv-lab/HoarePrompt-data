    #The program returns a string `s` which is a converted version of the characters in `b` according to the dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on their position in the sorted set.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an encoded string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string `s`. Each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on their position in the sorted set. The function first creates a mapping dictionary `char_map` to establish these backward mappings, then constructs the decoded string `s` by applying this mapping to each character in `b`.
