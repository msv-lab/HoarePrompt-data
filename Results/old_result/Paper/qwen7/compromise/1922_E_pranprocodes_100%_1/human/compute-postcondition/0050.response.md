The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be different from 1.

Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer greater than 1. This condition already ensures that `x` is not equal to 1, so no adjustment is necessary.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is 0**
