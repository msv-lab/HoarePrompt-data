Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is 50000000, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000**

Explanation: The value of `x` is halved using the floor division operator `//`, which means `x = x // 2`. Given that `x` was initially a specific even number (though not explicitly stated, we know it's even from the precondition), it is now halved to become 50000000. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
