Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` is 0, `max` is decreased by 1, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999 and may be increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and `ans` now contains the value of `max - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 using floor division. Given that the initial value of `x` is 0 (since `x` must not be equal to 1 and the only way for `x` to be 0 after the operation is if it was initially 0), `x` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
