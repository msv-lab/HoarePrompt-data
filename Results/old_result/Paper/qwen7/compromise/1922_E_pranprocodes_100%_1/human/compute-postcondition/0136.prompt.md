You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute for as many times as specified by the input value of `i`. After all iterations, `i` will equal the total number of iterations, `x` will be 1, `max` will be `100000000 - t`, where `t` is the total number of iterations, `min` will be `-100000000 + t`, and `ans` will be a list containing integers starting from `max - t` and decrementing by 1 until `-100000000 + t`, with the list reversed. The variable `t` will hold the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1 across all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `i` will be the total number of iterations, `x` will be 1 (since it eventually reaches 1), `max` will be adjusted based on the total number of iterations, `min` will also adjust accordingly, `ans` will contain a sequence of numbers starting from `max - t` down to `-100000000 + t`, and this list will be reversed, and `t` will store the cumulative number of steps taken for `x` to reach 1 across all inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer X where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18} for each test case t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
