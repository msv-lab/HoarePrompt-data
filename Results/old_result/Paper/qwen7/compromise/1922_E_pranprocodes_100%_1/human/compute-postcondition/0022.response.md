Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 0.5, `max` is 99999899, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing 99999999**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides `x` by 2 using integer division, making `x` equal to 0.5. The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
