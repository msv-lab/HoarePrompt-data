Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is 0.**

The code initializes `t` to 0. Since `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` were already defined in the initial state and no operations were performed on them, their values remain unchanged.
