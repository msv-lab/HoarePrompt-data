To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is -100000000.
   - `min` is 100000000.
   - `ans` is a list containing integers from 100000000 to -100000000 in reverse order.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(t)
   ```

Given the initial state, the key variable here is `t`, which represents the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1. Since `x` is initially set to 1, no iterations are needed for `x` to become 1. Therefore, `t` is 0.

Output: **0**
