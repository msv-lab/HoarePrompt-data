Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`, `t` is 0, `x` is an odd number**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` is -100000000, the list `ans` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
