Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing integers from 100000000 to -100000000 in reverse order, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of an integer input from the user. The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The output state reflects these changes and retains the initial values of the unaffected variables.
