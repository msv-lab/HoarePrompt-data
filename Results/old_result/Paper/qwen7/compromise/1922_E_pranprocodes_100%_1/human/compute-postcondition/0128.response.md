Output State: `t` is the number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1, `i` is 3, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, `ans` is a list containing `max - t` repeated when `x` was even and `-100000000 + t` repeated when `x` was odd during the iterations.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `x` will eventually become 1. The variable `t` keeps track of the number of iterations, so `t` will be the total number of steps taken for `x` to reach 1. During each iteration, if `x` is even, `max` decreases by 1, and if `x` is odd, `min` increases by 1. Therefore, `max` will end up being `100000000 - t` and `min` will be `-100000000 + t`. The list `ans` will contain the values of `max` (reduced by the number of iterations) when `x` was even and the values of `min` (increased by the number of iterations) when `x` was odd throughout the iterations.
