Output State: `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing integers from -100000000 to 100000000 (inclusive), `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Each iteration of the loop modifies `max`, `min`, `ans`, and increments `t`. After `x` becomes 1, the loop terminates. Given the initial conditions and the operations within the loop, `max` will decrease with each even `x`, and `min` will increase with each odd `x`. Since `ans` appends either `max` or `min` in each iteration, it will contain a sequence of integers from `-100000000` to `100000000` (inclusive). The value of `t` will be the total number of iterations required for `x` to reach 1.
