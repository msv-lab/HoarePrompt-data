Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t`: Total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.
   - `i`: Still 3.
   - `x`: 1.
   - `max`: 100000000 - `t`.
   - `min`: -100000000 + `t`.
   - `ans`: A list containing `max - t` repeated when `x` was even and `-100000000 + t` repeated when `x` was odd during the iterations, and `ans` has been reversed.

2. **Determine the Value of `t`:**
   Since `x` is 1, and the problem states that `x` became 1 after `t` iterations, `t` must be the number of iterations it took for `x` to reach 1. Without knowing the exact sequence of operations that led to `x` becoming 1, we can assume `t` is a specific value that makes sense in the context. However, since `x` is explicitly stated as 1, let's assume `t` is a value that fits the context, but for simplicity, let's assume `t = 0` (since no operations were needed to make `x` 1).

3. **Calculate `max` and `min`:**
   - `max = 100000000 - t = 100000000 - 0 = 100000000`.
   - `min = -100000000 + t = -100000000 + 0 = -100000000`.

4. **Determine `ans`:**
   - Since `x` is 1, and assuming `x` was even during the iterations, `ans` would contain `max - t` repeated.
   - `max - t = 100000000 - 0 = 100000000`.
   - Therefore, `ans` is a list containing `100000000` repeated.
   - Since `ans` is reversed, the list is `[100000000]`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(*ans)` will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.
   - Since `ans` is `[100000000]`, the output will be `100000000`.

Output: **100000000**
