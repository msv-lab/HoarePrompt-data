Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `arr` is a permutation array of length `n` returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the result of `func_2()` to `arr`. Since `func_1()` returns the values of `n` and `k`, these values remain unchanged. `arr` is now a permutation array of length `n`, which means it contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
