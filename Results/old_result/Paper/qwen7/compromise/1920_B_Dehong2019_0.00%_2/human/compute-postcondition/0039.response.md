Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `i`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` will be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the value of each element from index 0 to index `x-1` in `a` after the loop completes.**

Explanation: The code takes an input of space-separated integers, converts them to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`, sorts the list in descending order using `sorted()` with `reverse=True`, and assigns the result to `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` is updated based on the new list `a` after the sorting operation.
