Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the element at index `x` in `a` minus twice the element at index `i` in `a`**.

In this output state, the variable `ans1` has been updated. Initially, `ans1` was defined as the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the element at index `x` in `a`. After executing the line `ans1 -= a[i] * 2`, `ans1` now equals the original `ans1` minus twice the element at index `i` in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
