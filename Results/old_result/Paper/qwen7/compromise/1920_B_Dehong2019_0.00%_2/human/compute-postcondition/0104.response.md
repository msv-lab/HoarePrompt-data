Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by `a[0] + a[i] + a[i]`, and if `0 + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[0 + x]`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 4, `ans1` is reduced by `2 * a[i + x]`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `ans1` is increased by `a[0] + a[i] + a[i]`.
- If `0 + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[0 + x]`.
- The variable `i` is set to 4.
- The variable `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- The code then subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`.

Since `i` is 4, `i + x` becomes `4 + x`. Therefore, `ans1` is reduced by `2 * a[4 + x]`.
