Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by `a[0] + a[i]`, and if `0 + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[0 + x]`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`. Since `i` is 2, the expression `i + x` becomes `2 + x`. Therefore, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[2 + x]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
