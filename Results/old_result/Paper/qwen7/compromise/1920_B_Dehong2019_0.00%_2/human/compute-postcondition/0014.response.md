Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the value of each element from index 0 to index `x-1` in `a`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2 = ans1` simply assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. No other changes occur to the variables. Therefore, the value of `ans2` is the same as the value of `ans1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
