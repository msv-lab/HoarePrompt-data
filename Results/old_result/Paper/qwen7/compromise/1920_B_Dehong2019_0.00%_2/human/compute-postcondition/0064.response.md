Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 2, `ans1` is increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[i]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` remains increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` assigns the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` to `ans`. This does not affect the values of `k`, `i`, or the condition for `ans1`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
