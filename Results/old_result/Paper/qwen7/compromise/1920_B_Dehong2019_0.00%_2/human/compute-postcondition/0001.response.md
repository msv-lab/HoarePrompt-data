Output State: **t is an input integer, and for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all i; and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` is now explicitly set to the integer input received. All other conditions and constraints on `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
