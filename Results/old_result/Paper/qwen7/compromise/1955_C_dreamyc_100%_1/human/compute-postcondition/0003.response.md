Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, `b` is the floor division of `k` by 2.**

The code calculates `a` as the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` as the floor division of `k` by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
