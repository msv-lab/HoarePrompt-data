Reasoning:
1. The problem requires simulating the attacks of the Kraken on the ships until all ships sink.
2. The given code attempts to solve this problem by calculating the sums of the first half and the second half of the list `nums` and comparing these sums with `a` and `b` respectively.
3. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks. Specifically:
   - The variable `ans` is incremented without considering whether the current ship has already sunk.
   - The sums `s_a` and `s_b` are updated for each index `i`, but they do not reflect the actual state of the ships after each attack.
   - The function does not simulate the actual sinking of ships and the changing of the first/last ship status after each attack.

Given the above points, the provided solution does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and therefore is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
