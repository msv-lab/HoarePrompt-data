### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a series of ships. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and the last ship until all ships sink.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durabilities of the ships.
   - The main logic is encapsulated in the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the total durability of all ships (`sum(nums)`), then all ships will be sunk, and the function returns `n`.
   - Otherwise, the function calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships separately.
   - It uses two variables `s_a` and `s_b` to keep track of the cumulative durability of ships from the start and end, respectively.
   - The function iterates through the list of ships, adding the durability to `s_a` and `s_b` and checking if the cumulative durability is less than or equal to the number of attacks on the respective sides (`a` and `b`).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling the case where `k` is greater than or equal to the total durability is correct.
   - The calculation of `a` and `b` is correct, representing the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively.
   - However, there is a flaw in the way the function handles the alternating attacks. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the alternating pattern of attacks. Instead of alternating between the first and last ships, the function simply counts the number of ships whose cumulative durability is less than or equal to `a` or `b`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The function `func_1` incorrectly simulates the alternating attacks. It does not actually perform the attacks in the specified order but instead counts the number of ships whose cumulative durability is less than or equal to `a` or `b`. This is not equivalent to the actual sequence of attacks.
- For example, consider the input `n=4`, `k=5`, and `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`. The correct sequence of attacks would be:
  1. Attack the first ship: `a = [2, 4, 3]`
  2. Attack the last ship: `a = [2, 4, 2]`
  3. Attack the first ship: `a = [1, 4, 2]`
  4. Attack the last ship: `a = [1, 4, 1]`
  5. Attack the first ship: `a = [4, 1]`

  The function, however, would incorrectly count the number of ships whose cumulative durability is less than or equal to `a` or `b` without performing the actual attacks.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks of the Kraken. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
