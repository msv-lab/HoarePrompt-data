Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a series of ships. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and the last ship until all ships sink.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durabilities of the ships.
   - The main logic is encapsulated in the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the total durability of all ships (`sum(nums)`), then all ships will be sunk, and the function returns `n`.
   - Otherwise, the function calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships separately.
   - It uses two variables `s_a` and `s_b` to keep track of the cumulative durability of ships from the start and end, respectively.
   - The function iterates through the list of ships, adding the durability to `s_a` and `s_b` and checking if the cumulative durability is less than or equal to the number of attacks on the respective sides (`a` and `b`).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling the case where `k` is greater than or equal to the total durability is correct.
   - The calculation of `a` and `b` is correct, representing the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively.
   - The iteration through the list of ships and the condition checks are also correct.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

Correctness: **True**
