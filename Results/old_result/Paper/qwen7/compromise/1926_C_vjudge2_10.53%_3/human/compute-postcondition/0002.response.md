Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables and objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is typically used when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an input integer.

2. Determine which states need to be adjusted:
   - The loop head involves the variable `t`, which determines the number of iterations.
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution, we do not need to adjust its state.

3. Ensure the conditions for the loop to execute:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (since `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`), and it must be non-zero because the loop runs `t` times.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
