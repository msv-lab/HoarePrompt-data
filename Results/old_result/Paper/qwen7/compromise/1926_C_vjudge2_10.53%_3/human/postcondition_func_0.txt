The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves reading an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). It then constructs two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, based on these integers and a predefined sequence. Finally, it prints the values from the `sum_values` list corresponding to the integers read in the test cases. The function does not return any value but modifies and uses global lists `values` and `sum_values` and an integer `total` during its execution.
