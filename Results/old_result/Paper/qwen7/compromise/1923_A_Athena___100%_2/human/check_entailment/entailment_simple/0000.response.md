Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to form a single block without any free cells between them with the minimum number of operations.
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` but does not account for the actual movement of chips.
   - The variable `res` is used to count the number of zeros in the list `a`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
   - The logic for moving chips to the closest free cell to the left is missing.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
