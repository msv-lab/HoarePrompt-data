Output State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. No changes are made to the other variables (`_`, `n`, and `a`). Therefore, the values of `_`, `n`, and `a` remain as they were in the initial state, and `res` is now explicitly set to 0.
