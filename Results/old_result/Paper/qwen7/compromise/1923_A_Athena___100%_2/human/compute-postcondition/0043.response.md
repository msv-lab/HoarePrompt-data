Output State: **`res` is 0, `a` does not have the first element which was 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the initial state mentions that the first element of `a` is 0, after executing this line, `a` no longer contains this first element, but `res` remains unchanged with its initial value of 0.
