Output State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, the first element of `a` is removed and the rest of `a` is whatever was after the first element.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. The first element of `a` is specified to be 0 in the initial state, so after executing the code, the first element is removed, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. The variables `res` and `_` are not affected by this operation.
