Output State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, the first element of `a` is removed.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` must be 0, after executing this line, the first element is no longer there. All other variables (`res`, `_`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
