Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in `a`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
