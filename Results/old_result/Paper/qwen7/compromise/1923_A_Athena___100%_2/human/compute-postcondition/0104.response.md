Output State: **The loop will continue to iterate until `i` equals the length of the list `a`. Once `i` reaches the length of `a`, the loop will stop. At this point, `res` will hold the total count of zeros in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `res` will contain the total number of zeros found in the list `a`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `t`, `n`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being equal to the length of the list `a`.
