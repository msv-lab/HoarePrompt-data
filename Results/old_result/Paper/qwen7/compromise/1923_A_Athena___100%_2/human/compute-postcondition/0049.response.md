Output State: **`res` is 0; `a` is a non-empty list and its last element is no longer 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the initial state of `a` is a non-empty list with its last element being 0, after executing `a.pop()`, the last element of `a` is no longer 0. The value of `res` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
