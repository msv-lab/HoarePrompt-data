Output State: **`res` is 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is equal to the length of the updated `a`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variable `res` remains unchanged and is still 0. The length of the list `a` is stored in `i`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
