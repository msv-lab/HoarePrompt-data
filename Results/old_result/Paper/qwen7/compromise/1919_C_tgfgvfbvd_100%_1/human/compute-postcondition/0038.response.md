Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[1]`, `b` is equal to `l[1]`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether `l[0]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 1.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `l[x] <= a` is true, then `a` is updated to `l[1]` and `c` remains as it was. If the condition is false, then `c` is updated to include the additional possibility of being 2.
