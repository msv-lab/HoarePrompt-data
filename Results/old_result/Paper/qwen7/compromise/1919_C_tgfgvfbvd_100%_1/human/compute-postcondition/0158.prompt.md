Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = float('inf'), float('inf')
    c = 0
    for x in range(n):
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        if l[x] <= a:
            a = l[x]
        elif l[x] <= b:
            b = l[x]
        else:
            a = l[x]
            c += 1
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to the number of elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to the minimum value in the list `l`, `b` is equal to the second smallest value in the list `l`, `c` is equal to the number of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`, and `x` is equal to `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be equal to `n-1`, `a` will be the minimum value found in the list `l`, and `b` will be the second smallest value found in the list `l`. The variable `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are larger than both `a` and `b`. The value of `n` will remain unchanged as it was initially provided as input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `initial_iterations - n` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` is the original input integer, `l` is the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `b` is the second minimum value in the list `l`, and `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
