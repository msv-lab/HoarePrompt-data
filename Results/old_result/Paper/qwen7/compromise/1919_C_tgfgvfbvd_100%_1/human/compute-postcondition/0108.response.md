Output State: **The number of remaining iterations is `initial_iterations - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The number of remaining iterations remains unchanged, and `n` retains its initial value as an input integer.
