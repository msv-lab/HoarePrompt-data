Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to positive infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, and `b` is now equal to `l[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to be equal to `l[x]`, and since `x` is 0, `b` is now equal to `l[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
