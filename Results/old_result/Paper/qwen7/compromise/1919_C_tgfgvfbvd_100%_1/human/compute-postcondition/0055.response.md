Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is equal to the minimum value in the new list `l`, `b` is equal to the second smallest value in the new list `l`, `c` is equal to the number of elements in the new list `l` that are greater than `b`, `x` is equal to `n - 2`**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This changes the state of the variable `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged except for `l`, which is now updated to the new list of integers.
