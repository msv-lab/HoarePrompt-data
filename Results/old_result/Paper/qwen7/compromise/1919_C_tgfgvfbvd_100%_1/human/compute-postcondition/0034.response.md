Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[1]`, `b` is equal to `a` (which is `l[1]`), `c` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether `l[0]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1. Since `c` was either 0 or 1, after the increment, `c` will now be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
