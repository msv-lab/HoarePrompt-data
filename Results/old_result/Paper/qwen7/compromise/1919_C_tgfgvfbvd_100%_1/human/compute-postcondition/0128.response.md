Postcondition: `initial_iterations - 2` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` remains 0; otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is updated to the current value of `a`, and `c` is set to 1.
