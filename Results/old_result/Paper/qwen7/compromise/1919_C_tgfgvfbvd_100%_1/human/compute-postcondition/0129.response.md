Postcondition: `initial_iterations - 2` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` remains 0. In either case, `a` is equal to `l[x]` and `b` is equal to `a`.
