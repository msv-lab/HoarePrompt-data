Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is 1, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` was equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` was equal to the original value of `a`. After swapping, `a` now holds the original value of `b`, and `b` now holds the original value of `a`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
