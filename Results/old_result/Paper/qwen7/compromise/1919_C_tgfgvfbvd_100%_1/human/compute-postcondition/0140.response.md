Postcondition: `initial_iterations - 3` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is now equal to `b`, `b` is equal to either `l[x]` or `l[x+1]` depending on the condition, and `c` is 1 if `b` is greater than `a`, otherwise `c` remains 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is set to `l[x]` and `c` is set to 1 if `l[x]` is greater than `a`; otherwise, `c` remains 0. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, `b` is set to `l[x+1]` and `c` is set to 2.
