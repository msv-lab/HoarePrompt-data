Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a flaw in handling cases where the string `s` consists of all unique characters but still has a length greater than 1. In such cases, the program should generate a different permutation of the string. However, the current implementation may still produce the same string due to the randomness involved in `random.sample`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the generated string `s2` is different from `s`. Hereâ€™s an improved version of the function:

```python
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            while True:
                s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
                if s2 != s:
                    break
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
```

This version ensures that `s2` is different from `s` by using a loop to keep generating permutations until a different one is found.
