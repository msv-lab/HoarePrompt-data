Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing either 'Yes' followed by a string or 'No'. For each test case, if the input string `s` has a length of 1 or if all characters in `s` are the same, the output will be 'No'. Otherwise, the output will be 'Yes' followed by a possibly rearranged version of the string `s`. The exact rearranged string or 'No' will depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
