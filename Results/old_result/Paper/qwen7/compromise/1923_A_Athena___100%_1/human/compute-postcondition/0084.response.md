Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is non-empty and the first element of `a` is the second element of the original list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
- `a` must be non-empty (`a != []`).
- The first element of `a` must be `0` (`a[0] == 0`).

Given the current state:
- `a` is non-empty (which is already satisfied).
- The first element of `a` is the second element of the original list `a`.

To ensure the loop executes again, the first element of `a` must still be `0`. If the first element changes to something other than `0`, the loop will terminate.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the first element of `a` remains `0` for the loop to continue.

**State:**
- `a` is non-empty.
- The first element of `a` must be `0`.

State: **`a` is non-empty and the first element of `a` must be `0`**
