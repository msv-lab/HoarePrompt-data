Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is not empty and its first element is now the second element of `a`, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element (which is 0) from the list `a`. Since `a` was not empty and its first element was 0, after executing the code, the first element of `a` is now the second element of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
