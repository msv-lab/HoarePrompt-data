Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, and it is set to the input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, the new state keeps this constraint but updates `t` to the specific integer input provided. All other conditions and constraints from the initial state remain unchanged.
