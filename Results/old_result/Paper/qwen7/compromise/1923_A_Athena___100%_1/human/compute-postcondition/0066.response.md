Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 2, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` is 1, so after executing this line, `res` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
