Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` does not contain the first element which was 0, `res` is 0, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since `a[0]` was initially 0, after executing this line, `a` no longer contains this element. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
