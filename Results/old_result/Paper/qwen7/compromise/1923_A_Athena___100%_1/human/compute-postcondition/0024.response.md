Output State: **`res` is 1, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` must have at least 1 element with its first element being 0.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially 0, it is now 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
