Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `res` is 3, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string into an integer. The resulting list is assigned to `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
