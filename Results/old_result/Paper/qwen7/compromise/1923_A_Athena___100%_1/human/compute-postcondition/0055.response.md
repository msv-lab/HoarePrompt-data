Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` does not contain a `0` and its last element is removed, `res` is `0`, `i` is `2`.**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was `0`, it is now removed. All other variables remain unchanged.
