Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `res` is 3, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.
