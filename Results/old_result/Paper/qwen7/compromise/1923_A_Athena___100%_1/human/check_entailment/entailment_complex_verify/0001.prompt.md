You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` has had all its trailing zeros removed, and the variable `res` contains the total count of trailing zeros that were removed.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `res` will be the total count of trailing zeros in the list `a`. The loop processes each input list `a` by removing leading and trailing zeros. Since the loop runs until all elements are processed, `res` will hold the count of trailing zeros that were present in the original list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of the list), and a list of n integers representing cells (0 for free, 1 for containing a chip). It removes all leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the number of trailing zeros removed. The function then prints this count for each test case. If no cells contain a chip (all values are 0), it does not return any specific value for that case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which is the number of cells.
   - It then reads a list of integers `a` representing the state of the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
   - The program removes leading free cells (cells with value 0) using a while loop.
   - It also removes trailing free cells using another while loop.

3. **Counting the Minimum Number of Operations:**
   - After removing the leading and trailing free cells, the program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the remaining list.
   - This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

### Testing the Logic

Let's test the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  8
  0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Explanation:
  - After removing leading and trailing free cells, we get `[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
  - There is one free cell at index 3.
  - Moving the chip at index 3 to the leftmost free position requires 1 operation.

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  0 1 0 0 0 0
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Explanation:
  - After removing leading and trailing free cells, we get `[1]`.
  - No free cells, so no operations are needed.

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Explanation:
  - No free cells, so no operations are needed.

#### Example 4:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 0 1 0 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Explanation:
  - After removing leading and trailing free cells, we get `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
  - There are two free cells at indices 1 and 3.
  - Moving the chips at indices 1 and 3 to the leftmost free positions requires 2 operations.

#### Example 5:
- Input:
  ```
  9
  0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Explanation:
  - After removing leading and trailing free cells, we get `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.
  - There are three free cells at indices 2, 3, and 5.
  - Moving the chips at these positions to the leftmost free positions requires 3 operations.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. It handles all the given test cases correctly.
