Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, but these integers are not passed as arguments to the function. Depending on the values of `t` and `n`, the function returns either an error message indicating that `t` is out of the specified range or a result based on the relationship between `t` and `n`.**
