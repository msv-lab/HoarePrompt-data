Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**

The code initializes the `alphabet` variable to contain all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `n`, while adding the new information about `alphabet`.
