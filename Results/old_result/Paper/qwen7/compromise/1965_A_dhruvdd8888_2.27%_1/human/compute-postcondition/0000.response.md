Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of N integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_N where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile i.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of integers is not yet defined. Therefore, the only change is that `N` is now an input integer within the specified range, while `t` retains its initial state.
