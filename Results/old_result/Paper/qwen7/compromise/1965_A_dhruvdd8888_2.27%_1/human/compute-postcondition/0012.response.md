Output State: **`cd` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list with an additional element 0 inserted at the beginning, and the rest of the list remains unchanged.**

The code initializes the variable `cd` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `t`, `N`, or `nums`, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
