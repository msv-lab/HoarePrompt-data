Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `nums` is a list of the unique elements from the input sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` sorts the elements of the set `nums` (after converting them to integers) in ascending order and assigns the result back to `nums`. Since `nums` was initially a set of unique elements, after sorting, it becomes a list. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged.
