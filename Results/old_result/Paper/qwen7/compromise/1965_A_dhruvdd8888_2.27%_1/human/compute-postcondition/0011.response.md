Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list with an additional element 0 inserted at the beginning, and the rest of the list remains unchanged.**

This means that the list `nums` now starts with 0, followed by its original elements. All other variables (`t` and `N`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
