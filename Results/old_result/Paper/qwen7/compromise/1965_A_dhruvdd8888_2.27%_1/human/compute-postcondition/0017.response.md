Postcondition: **`cd` is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of numbers starting from the second element of the list `nums`, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list with an additional element 0 inserted at the beginning, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The current value of `cd` is such that it is an odd number.**
