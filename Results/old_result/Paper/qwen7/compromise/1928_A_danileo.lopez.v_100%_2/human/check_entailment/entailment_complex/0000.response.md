Reasoning:

The provided function `func()` aims to determine whether Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and recombining them. The logic in the function is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
3. It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
   - If \(a\) is even, it divides \(a\) by 2 and checks if the resulting halves do not match \(b\). If they don't match, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If \(b\) is even, it divides \(b\) by 2 and checks if the resulting halves do not match \(a\). If they don't match, it prints 'Yes'.
4. If neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is even, it prints 'No'.

This logic correctly identifies when Bob can form a different rectangle:
- When either dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two equal halves and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.
- When both dimensions are odd, no matter how you cut the rectangle, the resulting pieces will always be able to form the original rectangle again, hence 'No'.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle.

Correctness: **True**
