### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain a different rectangle by cutting an \(a \times b\) rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always achieve this by cutting the rectangle in half along the even dimension and then rearranging the pieces.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle since cutting an odd dimension results in two odd dimensions, and no combination of these can form a different rectangle.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
     - If \(a\) is even, it checks if \(a // 2\) is not equal to \(b\). If true, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
     - If \(b\) is even, it checks if \(b // 2\) is not equal to \(a\). If true, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
     - If neither condition is met, it prints 'No'.
   - If neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is even, it directly prints 'No'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the conditions under which Bob can form a different rectangle:
     - If \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle in half along that dimension and rearrange the pieces to form a different rectangle.
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle since cutting an odd dimension results in two odd dimensions, and no combination of these can form a different rectangle.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where \(a\) or \(b\) is 1 (which is odd), and it correctly identifies that such cases cannot form a different rectangle.
   - However, there is a logical flaw in the program's handling of the case when both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. The program should check if at least one of the halves can form a different rectangle, but it currently does not do so comprehensively.

5. **Comprehensive Check:**
   - When both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, the program should consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and check if any of those configurations can form a different rectangle.
   - The current implementation only checks if \(a // 2\) is not equal to \(b\) or vice versa, which is insufficient.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case when both \(a\) and \(b\) are even comprehensively. It should check all possible ways to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and ensure that at least one of those configurations can form a different rectangle.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
