Reasoning:
The provided program logic correctly identifies whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Checking Even Dimensions**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the program checks if cutting the rectangle in half results in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - Specifically, it checks if half of the even dimension matches the other dimension.
   - If such a match is found, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a different rectangle can be formed.
   - If no such match is found, it prints 'No'.
3. **Handling Odd Dimensions**:
   - If both dimensions are odd, the program correctly prints 'No' since there is no way to cut an odd-sized rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different rectangle.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
