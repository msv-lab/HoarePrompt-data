Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases through input where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each pair, the function returns either `a + b` or `a - b` based on a condition, but the specific condition is not provided in the given information.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers `a` and `b`, and performs either addition or subtraction based on an unspecified condition within each test case. The function then returns the result of the operation for each test case.
