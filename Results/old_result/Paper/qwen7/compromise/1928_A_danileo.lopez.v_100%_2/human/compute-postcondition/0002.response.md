Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input pair (a, b), if either a or b is even and the conditions specified in the loop body are met, 'Yes' will be printed; otherwise, 'No' will be printed. The final output state consists of 'Yes' or 'No' for each iteration, printed on separate lines.
