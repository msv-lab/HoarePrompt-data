You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\).
   - The conditions for a pair to be considered "beautiful" are:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For the pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, the following must hold:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)

3. **Simplifying the Conditions:**
   - From the above conditions, we get:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x} \Rightarrow a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\)
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y} \Rightarrow a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\)

   - Combining these, we need:
     - \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\) and \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\)

4. **Approach in the Code:**
   - The code uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the remainders when elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element \(a_i\), it calculates the remainders \((-a_i \mod x + x) \% x\) and \(a_i \mod y\).
   - It checks if this pair of remainders exists in the frequency dictionary and updates the count accordingly.
   - It also updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs.
   - The `func_2` function reads the input correctly and processes each test case using `func_1`.

### Detailed Verification

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound.
  - The use of modulo operations to handle negative values is correct.
  - The frequency dictionary is updated and queried correctly.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The input reading and splitting into test cases is done correctly.
  - Each test case is processed using `func_1` and the results are printed correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.
