### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the key points and verify them step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)

3. **Simplifying the Conditions:**
   - These conditions imply:
     - \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\)
     - \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\)

4. **Approach in the Code:**
   - The code uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the remainders when elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element \(a_i\), it calculates the remainders \((-a_i \mod x + x) \% x\) and \(a_i \mod y\).
   - It checks if this pair of remainders exists in the frequency dictionary and updates the count accordingly.
   - It also updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders.

5. **Detailed Verification:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - The logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound.
     - The use of modulo operations to handle negative values is correct.
     - The frequency dictionary is updated and queried correctly.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - The input reading and splitting into test cases is done correctly.
     - Each test case is processed using `func_1` and the results are printed correctly.

Given the detailed verification, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The original assessment is accurate.
