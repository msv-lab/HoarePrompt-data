Output State: **`idx` is increased by 2; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of the first part of `data[idx]` split by spaces; `x` is the integer value of the second part of `data[idx]` split by spaces; `y` is the integer value of the third part of `data[idx]` split by spaces; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer; `test_cases` is a list that now includes a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**.

This means that the code has updated the value of `arr` by converting the elements of `data[idx + 1]` into integers using the `map` function and converting the result to a list. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
