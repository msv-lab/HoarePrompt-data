Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input along line breaks.**

Explanation: The code reads multiple lines of input from the standard input using `input().splitlines()`. This splits the input into a list of strings, each representing one line of input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state, and `data` is initialized as a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
