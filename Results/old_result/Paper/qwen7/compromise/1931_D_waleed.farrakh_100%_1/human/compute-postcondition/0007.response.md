Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from the split data, `x` is an integer from the split data, `y` is an integer from the split data, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the string `data[idx + 1]` and converting each resulting substring into an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The original values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but now `arr` holds the list of integers obtained from the split operation.
