Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from the split data, `x` is an integer from the split data, `y` is an integer from the split data**.

The code splits the string from `data[idx]` and assigns the resulting integers to `n`, `x`, and `y`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
