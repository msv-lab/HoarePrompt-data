Output State: **`results` now contains the value of `count`, `count` is set to 0, `current_pair`, `rx`, `ry`, and `freq` remains an empty dictionary.**

In this case, the variable `count` is explicitly set to 0, while the other variables (`current_pair`, `rx`, `ry`, and `freq`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
