Output State: **`count` is increased by `freq[rx, ry]`, `current_pair` is `((-a % x + x) % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`**.

This means that the `count` variable has been incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. The `current_pair`, `rx`, and `ry` remain unchanged from their initial values.
