Postcondition: `arr` must contain at least one element. If the tuple `(rx, ry)` is found in the set `freq`, then `count` is increased by the size of the set `freq` containing the tuple `(rx, ry)`. If `(rx, ry)` is not found in `freq`, then `count` remains unchanged, and `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y.
