Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rx` using the formula `(-a % x + x) % x`. Since the initial values of `a` and `x` are not specified, `rx` is calculated based on these values. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
