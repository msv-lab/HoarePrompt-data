Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `a` as iterating over the elements in `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `count` is currently 0.
   - `results` contains the value of `count` from the previous iteration.
   - `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are set to the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `arr` is not empty for the loop to execute. The other variables (`count`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `freq`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute; they are part of the context but not the loop head itself.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` must contain at least one element**
