Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, input data is read from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`, other variables are not initialized or updated.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.read` method. This does not change the value of `t` or initialize any new variables like `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. It only affects how input is read from the standard input.
