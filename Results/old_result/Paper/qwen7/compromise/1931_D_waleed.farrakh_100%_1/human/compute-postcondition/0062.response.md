Output State: **`arr` contains at least one element, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is undefined, and `count` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `rx` based on the formula `(-a % x + x) % x`. This calculation updates the value of `rx`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial values of `arr`, `current_pair`, `ry`, and `count` are preserved.
