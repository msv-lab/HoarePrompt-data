Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. This means the loop variable is `_` (a placeholder), and the loop will iterate `t` times.

2. **Determine the state changes needed**: We need to determine how the state should change for the loop to execute one more time. The key variables here are `t` and `idx`.

3. **Analyze the given information**:
   - `idx` is increased by 2.
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is an integer from the split data.
   - `x` is an integer from the split data.
   - `y` is an integer from the split data.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer.
   - `test_cases` is a list that now includes a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates based on `t`, `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue.
   - `idx` is already known to be increased by 2, so no further adjustment is needed for `idx`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` must be decreased by 1.
   - `idx` remains as it is, increased by 2.
   - `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`idx` is increased by 2, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `x` is an integer from the split data; `y` is an integer from the split data; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer; `test_cases` is a list that now includes a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**
