Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `count` is 0, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` must contain at least one element, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is undefined, `ry` is undefined, `count` remains unchanged. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, its frequency is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `count` is increased by `freq[current_pair]` + 1, and `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y). If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `count` is increased by freq[current_pair] + 1, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `ry` is updated to a % y, `count` is either count + freq[(rx, ry)] if (rx, ry) is in freq, or just count + 1 if (rx, ry) is not in freq, and `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 regardless of whether (rx, ry) is in freq or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
