Postcondition: `arr` contains at least one element, `count` is increased by `freq[(a % x, a % y)]`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `count` is further increased by `freq[current_pair]` and `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1 and if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is further increased by `freq[rx, ry]`.
