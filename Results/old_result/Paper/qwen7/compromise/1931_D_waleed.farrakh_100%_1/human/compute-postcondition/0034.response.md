Postcondition: `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `count` is increased by freq[current_pair] + 1, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), if current_pair is in freq, freq[current_pair] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, freq[current_pair] is set to 1, `ry` is updated to a % y, `count` is either count + freq[(rx, ry)] if (rx, ry) is in freq, or just count + 1 if (rx, ry) is not in freq.
