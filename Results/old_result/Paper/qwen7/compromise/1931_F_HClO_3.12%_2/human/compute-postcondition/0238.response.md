Output State: **`idx1` is less than `idx2`; `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`; `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `l22`, `val` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `l22`, and `val` remain unchanged from their initial states.
