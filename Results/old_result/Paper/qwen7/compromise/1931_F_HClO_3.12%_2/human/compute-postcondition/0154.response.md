Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `idx1` is either -1 or 0.
- `idx2` is either -1 or 0.
- `p1` is either 0 or 1.
- `p2` is either 0 or 1.
- `t` is 0.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Since no specific values for `n`, `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `t` are required to determine the output of the `print` statement, the output is solely determined by the string provided within the `print` function.

Output: **yes**
