Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0; `idx2` is either -1 or 0; `p1` is either 0 or 1; `p2` is either 0 or 1; `val` is an empty list; `a3` is an integer input from the user; `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs; the index of `a3` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l3` has `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`; `l` is assigned the value of `l2`.**

Explanation: The code `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. Since no specific value for `l2` is given, `l` now holds whatever value `l2` had before. All other variables remain unchanged.
