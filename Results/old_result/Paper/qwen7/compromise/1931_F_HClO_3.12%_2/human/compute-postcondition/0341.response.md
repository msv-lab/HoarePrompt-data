Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is -1 and `idx2` is `i`, while `p1` is 0 and `p2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
