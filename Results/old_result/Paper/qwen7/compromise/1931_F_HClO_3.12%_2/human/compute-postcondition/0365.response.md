Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is 0, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = i` updates the value of `idx1` to be equal to `i`. The values of `idx2` and the condition related to `i`, `max(p1, p2)`, and `n` remain unchanged.
