Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1) + 1 + max(p1, p2) = n - 1` or `(i + 1) + 1 + max(p1, p2) = n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is `i`, `p1` is 1, and `idx2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `idx2` is `i`, and `p2` is 1.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the postconditions and conditions related to the variables remain the same as the initial state.
