Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `idx1` and `idx2` are integers.
- `p1` and `p2` are integers.
- The postcondition specifies that if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then:
  - If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `idx1` remains 0, `idx2` remains 0, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` becomes 1.
  - Otherwise, `idx1` becomes -1, `idx2` becomes the current index `i`, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` becomes 1.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < n - 2`).

2. **Variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`:**
   - These variables are determined by the postcondition based on the values of `l1[i + p1]` and `l2[i + p2]`.

### Adjusting the States:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged unless the condition in the postcondition is met.

### Conclusion:
- Since the loop is about to execute the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the condition in the postcondition is triggered.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the condition in the postcondition is triggered.

Given the information provided, the states do not change unless the condition in the postcondition is met. Therefore, the states remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

If the condition in the postcondition is triggered, the states will change accordingly. However, since no specific values for `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` are given, we assume they remain unchanged unless explicitly specified by the condition.
