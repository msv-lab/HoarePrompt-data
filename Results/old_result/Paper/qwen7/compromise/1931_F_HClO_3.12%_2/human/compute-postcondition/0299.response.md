Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration, `a1` is the first element of the input split into integers, and `l1` is the rest of the elements split into a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a1` and the rest to `l1` as a list. The values of `n`, `m`, and `val` remain unchanged.
