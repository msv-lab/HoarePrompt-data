Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is typically used when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop also uses `t` as the range parameter.

2. Determine the conditions under which the loop can execute:
   - The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.

3. Adjust the state based on these conditions:
   - Since `t` is the only variable that affects the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
