Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `val` must contain at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` and `l3` will be the first tuple from `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `m` and `val`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged as they are derived from the first tuple in `val`.
