Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs, the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l` is now equal to `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. Since `l1` contains `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `l` now also contains `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
