Postcondition: **`val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, each of the form (a3, l3), `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l3` is not equal to a list of elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`.**
