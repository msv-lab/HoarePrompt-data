Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `l3` now contains `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a1` into the list `l3` at the index specified by `idx2`. The values of `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, and the relative indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` remain unchanged.
