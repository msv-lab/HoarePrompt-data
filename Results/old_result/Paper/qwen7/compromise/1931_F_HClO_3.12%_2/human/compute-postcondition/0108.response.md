Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, with `idx1` not being strictly greater than `idx2`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged. The condition that `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2` with `idx1` not being strictly greater than `idx2` also remains valid.
