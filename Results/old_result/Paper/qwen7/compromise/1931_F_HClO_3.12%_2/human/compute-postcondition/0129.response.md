Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `m` must be greater than 3**.

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes the input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3` as a list. The variable `val` remains unchanged and still contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`. The condition for `m` being greater than 3 is not affected by this code.
