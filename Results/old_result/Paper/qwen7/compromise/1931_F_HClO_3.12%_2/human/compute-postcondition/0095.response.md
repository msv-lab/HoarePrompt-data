Output State: `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will depend on the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically:
- `idx1` and `idx2` can either remain -1 (if no matching conditions were met) or be set to 0 (if a match was found).
- `p1` and `p2` will be set to 1 if their respective conditions (`l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`) were met, otherwise they will remain 0.
