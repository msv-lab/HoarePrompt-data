Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the loop will have executed `m-2` times. No inputs are stored or used in calculations during the loop's execution.**

In natural language, this means that the variable `m` must still be at least 3 for the loop to run completely. The loop runs `m-2` times as specified, and although it accepts inputs each time, these inputs are not stored or used in any calculations.
