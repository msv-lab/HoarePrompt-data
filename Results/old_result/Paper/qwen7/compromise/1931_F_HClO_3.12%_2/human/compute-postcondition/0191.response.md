Output State: **`idx1` is equal to `i`, `n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code sets `p1` to 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `p1` is now 1, but the exact value of `p2` is not specified, so we keep it as `p2`. The rest of the conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state.
