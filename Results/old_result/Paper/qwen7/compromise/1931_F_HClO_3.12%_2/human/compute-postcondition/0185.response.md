Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
