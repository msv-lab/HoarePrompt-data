Postcondition: `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `val` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `a3` is an integer read from input, and `l3` is a list of integers read from input. `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`.
