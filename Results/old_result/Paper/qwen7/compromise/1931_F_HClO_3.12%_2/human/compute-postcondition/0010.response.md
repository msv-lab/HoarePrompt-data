Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, and `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code uses `map(int, input().split())` to convert the input into integers and splits it into a list. The first element (`a2`) is assigned to `a2`, and the rest of the elements are unpacked into `l2`. The initial values of `a1`, `l1`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
