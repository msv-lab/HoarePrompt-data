Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `val` must contain at least one tuple, and we break out of the loop.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. Since the loop condition was not explicitly given, we assume that the loop would continue until the condition `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` excluding `a3`. However, the `break` statement is executed, which means the loop is exited without further checks. Therefore, the values of `m`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged, and the loop breaks.
