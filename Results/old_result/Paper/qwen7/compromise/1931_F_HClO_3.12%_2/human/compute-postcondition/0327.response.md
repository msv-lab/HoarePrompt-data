Output State: **`idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 0, to `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx1` is updated to 0, while `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and the condition `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` remain as they were initially.
