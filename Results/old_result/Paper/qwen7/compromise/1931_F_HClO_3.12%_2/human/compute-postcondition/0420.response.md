Postcondition: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers. The current list `l3` is not equal to a list created by taking all elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`.**
