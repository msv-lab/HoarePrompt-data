Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is equal to `i`, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. The values of `idx1`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (`i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`) is not checked or affected by this assignment.
