Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` to `idx2`. The values of `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is not relevant to the assignment of `idx2`.
