Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, and the list at index `idx1` has been inserted with the value `a2`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. Since `l2` was not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a list. The other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`) remain unchanged.
