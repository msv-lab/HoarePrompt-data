Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then:

- If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `idx1` remains 0, `idx2` remains 0, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` becomes 1.
- Otherwise, `idx1` becomes -1, `idx2` becomes the current index `i`, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` becomes 1, ensuring that `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`.
