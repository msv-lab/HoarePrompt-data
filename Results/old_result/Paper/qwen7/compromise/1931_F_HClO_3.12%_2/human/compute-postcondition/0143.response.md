Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`.
- `m` is greater than 2.
- `idx1` is either -1 or 0.
- `idx2` is either -1 or 0.
- `p1` is either 0 or 1.
- `p2` is either 0 or 1.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Since no other variables or objects are being referenced in the `print` statement, and the statement itself does not depend on the values of `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`, the output will be the literal string `'no'`.

Output: **'no'**
