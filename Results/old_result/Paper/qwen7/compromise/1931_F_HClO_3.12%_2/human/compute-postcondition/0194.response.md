Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `idx2` is equal to `i`, and the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is true, and either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`.**

The code `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
