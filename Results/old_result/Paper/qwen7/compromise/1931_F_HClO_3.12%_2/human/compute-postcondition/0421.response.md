Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx1` and `idx2` are integers.
- `p1` and `p2` are integers.
- `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers. The current list `l3` is not equal to a list created by taking all elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'no'` without any modification or additional context based on the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, or the contents of the `val` list.

Output: **no**
