Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 2.
- `val` must contain at least one tuple.
- `a3` and `l3` will be the next tuple from `val`.
- If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` excluding `a3`, the loop breaks; otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'no'`.

Given the conditions and the fact that no other operations are performed on the variables before the print statement, the value printed will be the string `'no'`.

Output: **'no'**
