Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are either both 0, or one of them is `i` with the corresponding `p1` or `p2` incremented by 1, and the other remains 0.
   - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1)`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `idx1` or `idx2` (whichever was set to `i`), and it was incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

5. **Possible States After Increment:**
   - If `idx1` was set to `i` in the previous iteration, then `idx1` is now `i + 1`.
   - If `idx2` was set to `i` in the previous iteration, then `idx2` is now `i + 1`.
   - The other variable (`idx2` or `idx1`) remains 0.

6. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` (which is either `idx1` or `idx2`) must be less than `n - 1`.

Given these considerations, let's update the states:

- If `idx1` was set to `i` in the previous iteration, then `idx1` is now `i + 1`.
- If `idx2` was set to `i` in the previous iteration, then `idx2` is now `i + 1`.
- Both `idx1` and `idx2` cannot both be non-negative at the same time, so we need to ensure that one of them is still 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`idx1` is `i + 1`, `idx2` is 0, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
