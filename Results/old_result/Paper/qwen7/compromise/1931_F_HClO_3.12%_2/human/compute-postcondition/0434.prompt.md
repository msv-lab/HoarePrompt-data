Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers. The loop has executed `m-2` times, so `val` contains exactly `m-2` elements.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers. If `l3` is not equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` are integers, and `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the same conditions hold but no action is taken within the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
