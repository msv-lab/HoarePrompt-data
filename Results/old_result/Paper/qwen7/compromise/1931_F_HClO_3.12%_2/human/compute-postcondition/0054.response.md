Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]` is true, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, depending on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`, either `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is 0, or `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is the current index `i`, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`.
