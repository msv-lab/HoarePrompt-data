Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int using `map(int, ...)` and then unpacks the first element into `a3` and the rest into the list `l3`. Since the exact input is not specified, we can only say that `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers.
