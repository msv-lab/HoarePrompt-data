Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means `val` now contains one element, which is the tuple consisting of `a3` and `l3`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged from their initial states.
