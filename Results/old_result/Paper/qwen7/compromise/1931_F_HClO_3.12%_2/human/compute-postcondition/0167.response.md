Output State: The loop will execute `m-2` times in total. After all iterations, `m` must be greater than 3, and an input will be taken but not assigned to any variable for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `m` must be greater than 5 (since it needs to be greater than 3 and the loop runs `m-2` times), and there will be `m-2` inputs taken but none of these inputs will be assigned to any variable.
