Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1) + 1 + max(p1, p2) = n - 1` or `(i + 1) + 1 + max(p1, p2) = n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, and `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is `i`, `p1` is 1, and `idx2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `idx2` is `i`, and `p2` is 1.
