Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx1` is an integer.
- `idx2` is an integer.
- `p1` is an integer.
- `p2` is an integer.
- `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'no'` without any variables or expressions being evaluated. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
