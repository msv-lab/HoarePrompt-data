Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and relationships between the variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
