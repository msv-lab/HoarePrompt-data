Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The list `val` contains exactly `m-2` tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`.
   - The variable `m` is greater than 2.
   - `idx1` is either -1 or 0.
   - `idx2` is either -1 or 0.
   - `p1` is either 0 or 1.
   - `p2` is either 0 or 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - The loop does not break and prints 'yes' after completing all iterations.
   - This implies that the condition inside the loop must hold true for all iterations.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop iterates `t` times without breaking.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop runs `t` times and does not break, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` must remain the same throughout the loop.
   - The value of `t` decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.

5. **Final State Before the Loop**:
   - After the loop completes, `t` will be 0.
   - `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will retain their initial values (either -1, 0, 0, or 1).

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - The only state that changes is `t`, which starts as some positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.
   - The other variables (`val`, `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the final iteration since the loop does not break) is:

**State: **`val` contains exactly `m-2` tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`, `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `t` is 0.**
