Output State: **`idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given context, the variables retain their initial values, and the break statement is noted.
