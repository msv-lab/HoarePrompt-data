Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `m` was initially set to a value greater than 2 and has remained unchanged. The user has entered input three times as required by the loop. The variables `a1`, `l11`, `n`, `a2`, `l2`, and `l22` retain their values from the initial state or after the third iteration, with no further changes. We continue to the next part of the program.**

This means that the `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead moves the program execution to the next iteration or part of the loop or conditional statement, depending on where it is placed. Since the loop has already completed its iterations, the `continue` statement here indicates that the program will proceed to the next logical step after the loop.
