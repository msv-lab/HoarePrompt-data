Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, the value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the value of `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**

The code `p2 = 1` updates the value of `p2` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
