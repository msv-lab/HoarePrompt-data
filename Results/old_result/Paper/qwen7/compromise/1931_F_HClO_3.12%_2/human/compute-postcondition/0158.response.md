Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from input after splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the rest to the list `l2`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, and `l1` remain unchanged.
