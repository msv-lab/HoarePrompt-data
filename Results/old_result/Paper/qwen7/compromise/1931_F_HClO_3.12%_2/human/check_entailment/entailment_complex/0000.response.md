Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and constraints specified in the problem statement.
2. The logic for determining if the orders can be made consistent is implemented correctly:
   - For the first two screenshots, it checks if the orders can be aligned by inserting the respective user at the appropriate position.
   - If the first two screenshots align, it proceeds to check subsequent screenshots by inserting the respective user in the appropriate position.
   - If the orders cannot be aligned without contradictions, it prints 'no'.
3. The program handles all test cases as per the example provided in the problem statement.
4. The overall structure of the program ensures that it processes each test case independently and prints the correct result ('yes' or 'no') for each case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
