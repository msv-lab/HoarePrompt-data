Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `a`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `a` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `a` is at least 1. If `a` is 0, the loop will not execute.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the state of the object `a` to be at least 1. The value of `t` does not directly affect the loop's execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` to be at least 1.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 1**
