Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for each position `i`. If this condition holds, it sets `l` to 'YES'. However, this does not guarantee that there exists a valid template `t` where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. It only checks one specific condition.

2. **Template Validation**: The program should validate if there exists any template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. The current implementation does not properly handle this validation.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if there is a way to assign each character in the template such that:
- Characters in positions where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same can be either lowercase or uppercase.
- Characters in positions where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ must be assigned differently according to the rules of templates.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()

        # Check if a and b can match the same template while c cannot
        can_match = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]:
                continue
            elif a[i] != b[i] and (a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]):
                can_match = False
                break
            else:
                can_match = False
                break
        
        print('YES' if can_match else 'NO')

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the conditions for matching and not matching the template are correctly checked.
