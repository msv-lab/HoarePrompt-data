You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `l` will be 'YES', `c` will be the last input string, `n` must be a positive integer, and the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` must be true for every `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the value of `i` will match the final value of `n`, `l` will be set to 'YES' if the specified condition holds for all characters in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their last input values, and `n` will hold the last value it was assigned during the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if for each character position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. This is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- For the first test case, the program would output "YES" because `a[0]` and `b[0]` are both 'a', and `c[0]` is 'a'. Similarly, `a[1]` and `b[1]` are both 'a', and `c[1]` is 'b'. However, this does not mean that there is no valid template. A valid template could be "AA", where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there is any character in `c` that differs from both `a` and `b` at the same position. If such a character exists, then it is impossible to create a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if there is any character in c that differs from both a and b at the same position
        valid_template_exists = any(a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] for i in range(n))
        
        if valid_template_exists:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies whether there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
