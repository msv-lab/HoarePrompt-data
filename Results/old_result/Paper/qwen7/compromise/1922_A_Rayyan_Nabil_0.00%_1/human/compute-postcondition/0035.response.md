Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- The function returns 'YES' if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.
- If either `a[i]` equals `c[i]` or `b[i]` equals `c[i]`, the function does not change the return value.

### Loop Head Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

### Current Value of `i`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
- The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`, which means `i` should be less than `n`.

### Adjustment Needed:
- Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, it is not less than `n`, and thus the loop will not execute again.
- However, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can potentially execute one more time.

### Adjusted State:
- To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `0` to `n-1`.
- Therefore, `i` should be set to `0` (the smallest possible value in the range).

### Conclusion:
- We need to reset `i` to `0` to allow the loop to start executing again.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it must still be greater than 0.
- The return value of the function remains unchanged based on the conditions provided.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the function returns 'YES' if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If either `a[i]` equals `c[i]` or `b[i]` equals `c[i]`, the function does not change the return value.**
