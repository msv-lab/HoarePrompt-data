Output State: **t must be greater than 0, i is n, n must be greater than 0, and l is 'YES'.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains greater than 0, `i` will be equal to `n` (the total number of iterations), `n` must still be greater than 0, and the variable `l` remains set to 'YES'. This means that for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` was true, leading to `l` being set to 'YES' without any changes to `t`, `i`, or `n`.
