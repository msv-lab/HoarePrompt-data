Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the variables `i` and `n` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the conditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `t`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `l` is 'YES'.
   - `c` is an input string.
   - `n` must be a positive integer.
   - Either `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]`, or the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is false.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i < t` must still hold true for the loop to continue.
   - `l` remains 'YES' as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `c` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains a positive integer as it is not affected by the loop.
   - The condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` must still be false for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and ensure that the loop condition `i < t` is still satisfied.

**State:**
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `t` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `l` is 'YES'.
- `c` is an input string.
- `n` must be a positive integer.
- The condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` must still be false.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent it symbolically. Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `t` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`, `l` is 'YES', `c` is an input string, `n` must be a positive integer, and the condition `a[i_prev + 1] != c[i_prev + 1] and b[i_prev + 1] != c[i_prev + 1]` must still be false.**
