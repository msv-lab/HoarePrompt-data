Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, and `l` is 'YES'. If `a[3]` is not equal to `c[3]` and `b[3]` is not equal to `c[3]`, then the conditions remain the same. If the condition `a[3] != c[3] and b[3] != c[3]` is true, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `l` do not change.
