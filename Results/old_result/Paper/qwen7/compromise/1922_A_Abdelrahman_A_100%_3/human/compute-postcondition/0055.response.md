Output State: **`no` is False, `c` must contain at least one character, x is not present in `a[counter]` and x is not present in `b[counter]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
