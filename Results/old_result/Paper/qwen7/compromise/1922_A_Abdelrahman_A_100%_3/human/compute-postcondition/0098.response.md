Output State: **`counter` is incremented by 1, `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not affect the values of the variables `counter`, `c`, or `no`.
