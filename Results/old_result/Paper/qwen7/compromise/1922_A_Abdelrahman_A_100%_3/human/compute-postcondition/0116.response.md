Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two input strings \(a\) and \(b\), and one string \(c\). For each test case, it checks if \(c\) contains any character that does not appear in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) matches either \(a\) or \(b\), or if every character in \(c\) is found in both \(a\) and \(b\), the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function reads the number of test cases, the length of the strings, and the strings themselves for each test case.**
