Output State: **`counter` is increased by 1, `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before, `x` is the next character in `c`, `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is inside. Therefore, the values of `counter`, `c`, `x`, and `no` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional statement.
