### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using `tests = int(input())` and iterating over each test case with `for i in range(tests)`.

2. **String Length Handling**: It correctly reads the length of the strings `slength = int(input())`.

3. **Reading Strings**: The function reads the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` as expected.

4. **Initial No Match Check**: The logic checks if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`. If this is true, it immediately prints "NO" because `c` would match the template if it were equal to either `a` or `b`.

5. **Template Validation Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `c` and checks if the character is not present in both `a` and `b` at the corresponding index.
   - If the character in `c` is not found in both `a` and `b` at the same index, it means that a valid template can exist where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. In this case, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a character, it means that no valid template exists, and it prints "NO".

6. **Final Output**: The function correctly prints "NO" if no valid template exists after checking all characters.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
