State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `len(arr) - 1` and `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `i <= j`.
2. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.
3. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true.
4. Since `i` is 0, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
5. Given that `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, and assuming `arr` is a non-empty list (which is a reasonable assumption since `j` is defined as `len(arr) - 1`), `j` will always be a non-negative integer.
6. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `j` being `len(arr) - 1`, but we need to ensure that `j` is indeed greater than or equal to `i`.

Thus, the state right before the loop should include the condition that `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`.
