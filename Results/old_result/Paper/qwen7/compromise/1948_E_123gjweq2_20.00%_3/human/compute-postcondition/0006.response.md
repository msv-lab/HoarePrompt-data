Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is a list where for each index `i` in the range `[left, left + mid - 1]`, `arr[i] = small_element + i` and `cliquess[i] = clique`.
