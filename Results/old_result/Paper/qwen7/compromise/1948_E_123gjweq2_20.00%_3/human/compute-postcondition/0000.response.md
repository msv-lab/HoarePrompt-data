Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, and `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

This means that the value of `left` remains unchanged, the value of `right` remains unchanged, the value of `clique` remains unchanged, and a new variable `small_element` is created and assigned the value of `left + 1`.
