Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of cliques needed (`cliques`) using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays: `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates over the range of `cliques`.
   - For each clique, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - The `make_array` function is responsible for assigning values to the array segments corresponding to each clique.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on the `left` and `right` indices.
   - It splits the segment `[left, right]` into two parts: one with `mid` elements and another with `not_mid` elements.
   - It assigns values to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays accordingly.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliquess` Array**:
   - In the `make_array` function, the `cliquess` array is being updated inside the loop where `arr` is being filled.
   - However, the `cliquess` array should be updated after all elements in the segment are assigned, not during the assignment process.
   - This could lead to incorrect values in the `cliquess` array.

2. **Assignment Logic**:
   - The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` seems correct but needs to ensure that the values are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.
   - The current implementation might not guarantee distinct values for all cases, especially when `k` is large.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not handle the output format correctly. It prints `cliques` and `cliquess` directly without ensuring they meet the required conditions.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    # Calculate the number of cliques
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    
    # Initialize arrays
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    
    # Assign values to arr and cliquess
    for i in range(cliques):
        start = i * k
        end = min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)
        
        # Assign values to arr
        for j in range(start, end + 1):
            arr[j] = j - start + 1
        
        # Assign clique index to cliquess
        for j in range(start, end + 1):
            cliquess[j] = i + 1
    
    # Print the results
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Conclusion

The original program had issues with the `cliquess` array and the assignment logic. After correcting these issues, the program should work as expected. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
