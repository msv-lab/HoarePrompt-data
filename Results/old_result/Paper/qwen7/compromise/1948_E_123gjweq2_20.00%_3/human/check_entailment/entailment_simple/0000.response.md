### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines a function `func_1` that takes `n` and `k` as inputs and assigns values to the vertices based on the conditions.
   - The function `make_array` is called within `func_1` to populate the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes `arr` and `cliquess` as lists of zeros.
   - It calls `make_array` for each clique, setting the values in `arr` and marking the corresponding cliques in `cliquess`.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - It divides the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns values to these parts based on the given conditions.
   - For the first half, it increments the value starting from `small_element` (which is `left + 1`).
   - For the second half, it decrements the value starting from `big_element` (which is `right + 1`).

5. **Output Analysis**:
   - The output of `func_1` matches the required format: it prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.
   - The logic used in `make_array` ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, as each segment of the array is assigned to a single clique.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The code correctly calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The assignment of values to `arr` and marking of cliques in `cliquess` follows the logic that ensures the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.
