Reasoning:
1. The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices of a graph and ensuring the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
2. The solution provided uses a function `func_1` to achieve this. The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which is a reasonable approach to ensure that each clique can potentially cover `k` vertices.
3. The `make_array` function is used to populate the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays. This function divides the range `[left, right]` into two halves and assigns values to these halves in a way that ensures the graph's edges are formed correctly based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k`.
4. The `arr` array is populated such that vertices within the same range of `k` are assigned the same value, which helps in forming cliques.
5. The `cliquess` array keeps track of which clique each vertex belongs to, ensuring that vertices in the same clique have the same value.
6. Given the constraints and the logic used, the solution appears to meet the requirements of the problem. The output format matches the expected format, and the logic seems sound for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
