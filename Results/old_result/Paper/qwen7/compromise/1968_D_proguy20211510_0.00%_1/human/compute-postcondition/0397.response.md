Output State: **`i` is 9; `sb` is `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9]`; `pres` is a list with the element `ss + s[7]`; `ss` is `ss + s[8]`; `pres` is now a list with two elements: the original element `ss + s[7]` and the new element `ss + s[9]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Given that `i` is 9, `ss + s[i]` becomes `ss + s[9]`. Since `ss` is already defined as `ss + s[8]`, `ss + s[9]` can be simplified to the updated value of `ss`. Therefore, `pres` now contains both `ss + s[7]` and `ss + s[9]`.
