Postcondition: `i` is `12 + len(pres)`, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - (12 + len(pres) - 1)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If the maximum value in `ptss` is less than the maximum value in `ptsb`, then `maxs` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `maxs` remains unchanged as well.
