Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`**.

In this case, the code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
