State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- For the loop to execute, the condition `i < k` must be true. This means that `i` should start from 0 and `k` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) to ensure the loop runs at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `k` must be greater than 0.
