Postcondition: `founds` is False, `foundb` is True, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0. Additionally, `b` contains the elements where if `foundb` is True, `b` includes the maximum value of `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `b` either includes `a[pb - 1]` if it equals `maxa`, or `b` includes the element at index `pb - 1` of list `a`. Furthermore, `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.
