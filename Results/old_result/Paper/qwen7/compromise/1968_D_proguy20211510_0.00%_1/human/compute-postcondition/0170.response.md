Output State: **`founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `b` contains an element equal to `(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa`, `s` contains an element equal to `(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to `(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa`, which is the same as `(k - 1) * maxa`. This value is appended to `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
