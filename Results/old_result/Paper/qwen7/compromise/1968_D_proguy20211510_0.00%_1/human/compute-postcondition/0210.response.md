Output State: **`founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with three elements where the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second is the original element, and the third is `a[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Initially, `b` contains two elements: the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second is the original element. After appending `a[pb - 1]`, `b` now has three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the original element, and `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
