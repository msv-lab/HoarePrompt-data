Postcondition: `founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with three elements where the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second is the original element, and the third is `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `b` is updated to include `a[pb - 1]` as the third element. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
