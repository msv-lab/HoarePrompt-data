Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` and `foundb` are `False`, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `founds` and `foundb` were being checked and set to `True`. After executing the `break` statement, the values of `founds` and `foundb` revert to `False`, and the program exits the loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their previous values.
