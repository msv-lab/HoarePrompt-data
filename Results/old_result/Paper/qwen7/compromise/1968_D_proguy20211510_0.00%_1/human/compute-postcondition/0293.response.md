Postcondition: **All elements in `ptsb` are calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` in `range(len(pres))`. All elements in `ptss` are calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` in `range(len(pres))`. The value of `maxs` is the maximum value among all elements in `ptss`. The value of `maxb` is the maximum value among all elements in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then `maxs` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `maxs` remains unchanged as well.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `maxs < maxb` is true or false, the values of `maxs` and `maxb` remain consistent with their definitions and do not change within the scope of the if-else block.
