Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing four elements where the first three elements are the same as before and the fourth element is `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is `True` or `(k - 6) * maxa` if `foundb` is `False`, `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - 6) * maxa` and the second element is `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is appended to `s` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `founds` is `True` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `foundb` is `True` if `a[pb - 1] == (k - 6) * maxa` or `False`, `i` is 6, `k` must be greater than 3, and `a[ps - 1]` is appended to `s`.**

The variable `ps` is updated to be equal to `p[ps - 1]`, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
