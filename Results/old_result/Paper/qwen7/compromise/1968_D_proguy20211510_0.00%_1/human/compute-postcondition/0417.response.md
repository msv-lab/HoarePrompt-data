Output State: **`i` is 14, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - i - 2`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12] + preb[13] + (k - 13) * b[13] + preb[14] + (k - 14) * b[14]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `pres[12] + (k - 14) * s[12]` and the second element is `pres[13] + (k - 14) * s[13]`, and `ptss` now has an additional element equal to `pres[14] + (k - 14) * s[14]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, which translates to `pres[14] + (k - 14) * s[14]` since `i` is 14. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
