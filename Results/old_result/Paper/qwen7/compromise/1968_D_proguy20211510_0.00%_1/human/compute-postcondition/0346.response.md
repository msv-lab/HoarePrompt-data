Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is the input integer decremented by 1.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `pb` is either the input integer or updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
   - `ps` is the input integer or updated to `p[ps - 1]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.
   - `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`.
   - `b` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` or `a[ps - 1]`.
   - `s` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`.
   - `founds` and `foundb` are `False`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` if `founds` is `True`, otherwise `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i < k`, and `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - All other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Updated State**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, and the conditions involving `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is either the input integer or updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the input integer or updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` or `a[ps - 1]`, `s` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, `founds` and `foundb` are `False`, `i` is 3, and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` if `founds` is `True`, otherwise `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
