Output State: **`foundb` is `True`, `n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` is `False`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given that `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, the list `b` now contains two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, which is `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
