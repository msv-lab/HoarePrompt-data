Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` is the input integer, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `b` and `s`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `a`, or `maxa`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
