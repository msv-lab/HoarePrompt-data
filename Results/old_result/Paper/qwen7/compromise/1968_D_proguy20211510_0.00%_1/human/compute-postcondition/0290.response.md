Based on the initial state provided:

- `ptsb` is a list where each element is calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` in `range(len(pres))`.
- `ptss` is a list where each element is calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` in `range(len(pres))`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value among all elements in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value among all elements in `ptsb`.
- `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.
- The current value of `maxs` is less than the current value of `maxb`.

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bodya'`. Since no variables or objects from the initial state are involved in this print statement, the output will be exactly as specified.

Output: **Bodya**
