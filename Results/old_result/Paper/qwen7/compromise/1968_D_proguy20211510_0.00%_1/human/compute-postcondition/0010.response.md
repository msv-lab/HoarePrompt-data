Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`.
- `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`.
- `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`.
- `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`.
- The current value of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
