Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
