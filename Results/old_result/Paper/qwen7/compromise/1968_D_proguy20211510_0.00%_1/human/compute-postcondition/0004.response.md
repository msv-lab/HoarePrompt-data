Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` are strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into four parts and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since the input is split, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` become strings. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
