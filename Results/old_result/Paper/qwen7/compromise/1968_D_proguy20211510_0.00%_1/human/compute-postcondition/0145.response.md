Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxs` is the maximum value of `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value of `ptsb`.
- `i` is `len(pres) - 1`.
- `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`.
- `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
