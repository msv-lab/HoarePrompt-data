Output State: **`foundb` is `True`, `founds` is `False`, `i` is 4, `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` if `founds` is `True`, otherwise `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code sets `foundb` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `foundb` is now `True`, while `founds` remains `False`, `i` stays as `4`, and the conditions for `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` remain the same as described in the initial state.
