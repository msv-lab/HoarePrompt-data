Output State: **`founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `b` contains an element equal to `(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `b`. This new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(k - 1) * maxa`. The values of `founds`, `foundb`, and `k` remain unchanged.
