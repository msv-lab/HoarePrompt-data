Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[i]`, `pres` is `pres + [ss + s[k]]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[i - 1]]`**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments `sb` by the value of `b[i]`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, `b[i]` is `b[k + 1]`. Therefore, `sb` is updated to `sb + b[k] + b[i]`, which is `sb + b[k] + b[k + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
