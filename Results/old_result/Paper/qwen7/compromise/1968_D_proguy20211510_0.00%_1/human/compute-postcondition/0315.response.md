Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 1, and both `founds` and `foundb` are `True`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `b`. Given that `i` was initially 0, after executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 1. The value of `b` is updated to include this new element. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
