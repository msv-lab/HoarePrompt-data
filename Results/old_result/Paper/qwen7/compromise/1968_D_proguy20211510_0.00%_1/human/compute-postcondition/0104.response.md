Output State: **`preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing `k` elements, each being either `maxa` if `foundb` is `True` or `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is `False`, `s` is a list containing `k` elements, each being either `maxa` if `founds` is `True` or `a[ps - 1]` if `founds` is `False`, `founds` is `True` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `foundb` is `True` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `i` is `k - 1`, `sb` is 0, and `ss` is 0.**

The code initializes two variables `sb` and `ss` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `preb`, `pres`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
