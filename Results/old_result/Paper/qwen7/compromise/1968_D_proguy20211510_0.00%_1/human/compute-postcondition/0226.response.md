Output State: **`founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 4, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with four elements where the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second is the original element, the third is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`, and the fourth is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `b`.
- The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.
- Since `i` is 4, the expression `(k - (i + 1))` simplifies to `(k - 5)`.
- Therefore, the new element added to `b` is `(k - 5) * maxa`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
