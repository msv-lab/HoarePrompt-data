Postcondition: `founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 4, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with four elements where the first is `0`, the second is the original element, the third is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`, and the fourth is `0`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
