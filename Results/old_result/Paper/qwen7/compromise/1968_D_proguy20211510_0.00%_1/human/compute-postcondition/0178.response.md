Output State: **`founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `b` has appended `a[pb - 1]`**

The code `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since the initial state does not provide the exact values of `a` and `pb`, we only know that `b` now includes this new element. All other variables (`founds`, `foundb`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
