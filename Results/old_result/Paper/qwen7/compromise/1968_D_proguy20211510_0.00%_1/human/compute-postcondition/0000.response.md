Output State: **t is a positive integer, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string values 'YES' and 'NO' to the variables `YES` and `NO` respectively. No other variables are affected, so their initial states remain unchanged. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain as they were in the initial state.
