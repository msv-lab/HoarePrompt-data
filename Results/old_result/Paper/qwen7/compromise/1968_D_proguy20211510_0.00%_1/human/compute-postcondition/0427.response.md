Output: **Bodya**

Explanation: The print statement `print('Bodya')` directly prints the string 'Bodya'. The values of other variables like `i`, `k`, `rem`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are not relevant to the print statement itself. The conditions described for these variables (e.g., `i` being `12 + len(pres)`, `rem` being `k - (12 + len(pres) - 1)`, `maxs` being less than `maxb`) do not affect what is printed by the statement.
