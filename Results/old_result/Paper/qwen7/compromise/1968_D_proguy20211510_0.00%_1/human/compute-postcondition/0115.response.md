Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `k + 2`
- `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[i - 1]`
- `pres` is `[pres[0], ss + s[i]]`
- `ss` is `ss + s[i] + s[i]`
- `preb` is `[sb + b[i - 1]]`

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(len(s)):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(s))`.
   - Therefore, `i` will take values from `0` to `len(s) - 1`.

2. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 2`.

3. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - So, the new value of `i` will be `k + 3`.

4. **Adjusting States Based on the New Value of `i`:**
   - We need to update the states based on the new value of `i`.

5. **Updating `sb`:**
   - The current value of `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[i - 1]`.
   - Since `i` was `k + 2`, `i - 1` was `k + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i - 1` will be `k + 2`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `sb` will be `sb + b[k] + b[k + 2]`.

6. **Updating `pres`:**
   - The current value of `pres` is `[pres[0], ss + s[i]]`.
   - Since `i` was `k + 2`, the new value of `pres` will be `[pres[0], ss + s[k + 3]]`.

7. **Updating `ss`:**
   - The current value of `ss` is `ss + s[i] + s[i]`.
   - Since `i` was `k + 2`, the new value of `ss` will be `ss + s[k + 3] + s[k + 3]`.

8. **Updating `preb`:**
   - The current value of `preb` is `[sb + b[i - 1]]`.
   - Since `i - 1` was `k + 2`, the new value of `preb` will be `[sb + b[k + 2]]`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `i` is `k + 3`
- `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[k + 2]`
- `pres` is `[pres[0], ss + s[k + 3]]`
- `ss` is `ss + s[k + 3] + s[k + 3]`
- `preb` is `[sb + b[k + 2]]`

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `k + 3`, `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[k + 2]`, `pres` is `[pres[0], ss + s[k + 3]]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k + 3] + s[k + 3]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[k + 2]]`**
