Output State: **`i` is 13, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12] + preb[13] + (k - 13) * b[13]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `pres[12] + rem * s[12]` and the second element is `pres[13] + rem * s[13]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, which is `pres[13] + rem * s[13]` since `i` is 13. The value of `rem` remains `k - i - 1`, and the other variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `ptss` now contains two elements: the first element is `pres[12] + rem * s[12]`, and the second element is `pres[13] + rem * s[13]`.
