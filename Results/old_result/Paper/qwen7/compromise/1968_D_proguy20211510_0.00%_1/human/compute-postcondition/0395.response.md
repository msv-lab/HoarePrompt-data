Output State: **`i` is 9; `sb` is `preb + b[6]`; `pres` is a list with the element `ss + s[7]`; `ss` is `ss + s[8]`; `preb` is a list with an additional element `sb + b[9]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given that `i` is 9, `sb` is `preb + b[6]`, `pres` is a list with the element `ss + s[7]`, and `ss` is `ss + s[8]`, the value of `sb + b[9]` is appended to `preb`. The other variables remain unchanged.
