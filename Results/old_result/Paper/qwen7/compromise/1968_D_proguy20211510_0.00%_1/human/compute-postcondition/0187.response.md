Output State: **`founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, and `s` contains the value of `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. The values of `founds`, `foundb`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
