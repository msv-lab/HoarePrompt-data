Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program incorrectly handles the input for `pb` and `ps`. These should be 1-indexed, but the code treats them as 0-indexed, which will lead to incorrect positions being accessed.

2. **Logic Errors**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the program assumes that the maximum value in `a` will always dictate the outcome, but this is not necessarily true. The program also does not correctly simulate the game for multiple turns, especially when considering the moves based on the permutation `p`.

3. **Incomplete Simulation**: The program does not fully simulate the game for `k` turns. Instead, it makes assumptions about the final scores without properly accounting for all possible moves and scores throughout the game.

4. **Unnecessary Variables**: Some variables like `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` are not used in the program and can be removed to simplify the code.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, pb, ps = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Convert 1-based index to 0-based index
        pb -= 1
        ps -= 1

        def simulate(start, other_start, k):
            score = 0
            pos = start
            for _ in range(k):
                score += a[pos]
                pos = p[pos] - 1
            return score

        bodya_score = simulate(pb, ps, k)
        sasha_score = simulate(ps, pb, k)

        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print("Bodya")
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print("Sasha")
        else:
            print("Draw")

func()
```

This corrected version properly simulates the game for `k` turns and correctly handles 1-based indexing.
