### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Input Parsing:
The program correctly parses the input for each test case, converting strings to integers and splitting the input into necessary variables.

#### Initial Score Comparison:
The program checks if the initial scores of Bodya and Sasha are equal to the maximum value in the array `a`. If they are, it prints "Draw". This part is correct because if both players start with the highest possible score, the game could end in a draw.

#### Handling Maximum Scores:
If the initial scores are not equal to the maximum value, the program directly prints "Bodya" or "Sasha" based on whose initial score is higher. This is also correct because if one player starts with the highest possible score, they will win without needing to move.

#### Incorrect Handling of Permutations:
The main issue lies in how the program handles the permutations and subsequent moves. The program does not simulate the actual game where players can move to different positions based on the permutation `p`. Instead, it only considers the initial scores and the maximum value in the array `a`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
Here, `p = [4, 1, 2, 3]` and `a = [7, 2, 5, 6]`. The program would incorrectly assume that Bodya (starting at position 3) has the highest initial score (7) and would print "Bodya" without considering the permutation moves.

However, the correct approach would be to simulate the game for each turn, considering the moves based on the permutation. The program should keep track of the current positions of both players and update their scores accordingly.

#### Correct Simulation:
To correctly simulate the game, the program should:
1. Initialize the scores for both players.
2. Simulate each turn, updating the scores based on the current positions and the permutation.
3. Determine the final scores after `k` turns.

Given the complexity of simulating all possible moves, the provided program does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases due to its failure to handle the permutation-based moves. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
