Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the necessary parameters (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`).
   - It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the scores of Bodya and Sasha are both equal to the maximum score `maxa`. If they are, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If only one of them has the maximum score, it prints the corresponding player's name.

3. **Dynamic Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then iterates over `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players.
   - For each turn, it appends the current score to the respective list and updates the position based on the permutation.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for both players' scores up to each turn.
   - It then calculates the total scores for each player considering the remaining turns.

5. **Final Comparison:**
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - Based on the comparison, it prints the winner or 'Draw'.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The initial checks for 'Draw' and the player with the maximum score are correct.

2. **Dynamic Score Calculation:**
   - The logic for updating the scores and positions is correct. However, the program assumes that the maximum score will always be achieved by staying at the position with the highest score. This assumption might not hold true for all cases.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sum calculation is correct and helps in efficiently calculating the total scores.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The final comparison logic is correct. However, the program does not consider all possible scenarios where the players might achieve the same score through different paths.

### Example Test Case Analysis:

Let's consider the first test case provided in the problem statement:

- **Input:**
  ```
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  Bodya
  ```

- **Program Execution:**
  - The program correctly identifies that Bodya's starting position has the maximum score (5) and Sasha's does not.
  - Therefore, it prints 'Bodya'.

### Conclusion:

The program handles the basic cases correctly. However, it does not handle all edge cases where the players might achieve the same score through different paths. For example, if both players can achieve the same score by taking different sequences of moves, the program might incorrectly determine the winner.

### Final Answer:

Given the analysis, the program is not fully correct because it does not account for all possible scenarios where the players might achieve the same score through different paths.

**Correctness: **False**
