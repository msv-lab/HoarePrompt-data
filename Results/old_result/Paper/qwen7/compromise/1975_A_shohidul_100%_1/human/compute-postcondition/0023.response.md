Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy the condition `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` does not hold, the same values of `check_all_new` and `new_all` as before the if statement are retained.
