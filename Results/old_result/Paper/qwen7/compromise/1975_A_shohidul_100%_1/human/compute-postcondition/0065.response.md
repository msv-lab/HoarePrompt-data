Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`, and `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`. `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new[i-1]` is greater than `new[i]` for at least one `i` in the range 1 to the length of `new`.**
