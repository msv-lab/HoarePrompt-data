Postcondition: `i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of the original sequence `a`. If `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise it is False. `new_all` is the result of the condition check [(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]. If the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]` is false, then no changes are made to `check_all_new` and `new_all`.
