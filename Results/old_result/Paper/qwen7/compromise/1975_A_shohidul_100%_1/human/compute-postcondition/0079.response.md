Postcondition: `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`; `new` is a list starting from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order; in either case (whether the conditions in the if part are met or not), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
