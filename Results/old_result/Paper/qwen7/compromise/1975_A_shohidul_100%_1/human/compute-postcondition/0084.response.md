Output State: **`i` is 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of the original sequence `a`.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3) to the end of the list. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and `new` is assigned the sliced portion of the list `a`. Since the exact content of `a` is not specified, we only know that `new` starts from index 3.
