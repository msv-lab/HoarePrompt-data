Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` which is `a[1]` and onwards, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`. The conditions `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both true.
