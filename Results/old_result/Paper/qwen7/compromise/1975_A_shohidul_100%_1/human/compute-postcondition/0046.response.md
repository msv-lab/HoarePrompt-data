Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has checked all possible pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 0 to n-2. 

If at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` was met, the loop would have printed either 'YES' or 'NO' and then broken out of the loop. Therefore, after all iterations, the loop did not find any such pair where the first element is greater than the second element.

If the loop did not break out, it means no such pair was found throughout the entire list `a`. Hence, the final output state is that the loop has completed all its iterations without finding any pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second element. 

Since the loop did not break, the final values of `check_all_new` and `new_all` will retain their last computed values within the loop, but since the loop did not break, these values will essentially reflect the state after the last iteration without any further checks. However, given the loop's structure, if it reached the end without breaking, it implies `check_all_new` and `new_all` would both be `True` because no violating pairs were found.

Thus, the output state can be described as: The loop has completed all its iterations without finding any pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second element, resulting in `check_all_new` and `new_all` being `True`.
