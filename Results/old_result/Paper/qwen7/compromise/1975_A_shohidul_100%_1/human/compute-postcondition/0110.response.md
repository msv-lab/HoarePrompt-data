Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer (its specific value is not given).
- `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` and onwards.
- `check_all_new` is True, meaning all elements in `new` satisfy the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of `len(new)`.
- `new_all` is True, meaning all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
- The condition `(check_all_new and new_all)` is satisfied.

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
