Output State: **`i` is 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of the original list or sequence `a`.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` slices the list or sequence `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3) to the end. Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `a`, `new` is described as a slice from index 3 onwards. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and the condition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid but not directly affected by the code.
