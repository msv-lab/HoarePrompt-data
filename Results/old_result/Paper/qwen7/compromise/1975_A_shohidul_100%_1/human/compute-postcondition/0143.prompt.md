Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive); no other variables are affected.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]
                    )
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all_new and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element, and the program prints 'YES' if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 such that the first element is greater than the second element, and prints 'NO' otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is True if all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-2` are less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `check_all` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the input split by spaces, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-2` are less than or equal to the next element, and after executing the if-else block, if `check_all` was initially `True`, it remains `True` if the condition holds, otherwise it becomes `False`. If `check_all` was initially `False`, it remains `False`. The output is 'NO' if the loop completes without finding a segment of the list `a` from index `i` to the end that satisfies both `check_all_new` and `new_all` being `True`, and 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
