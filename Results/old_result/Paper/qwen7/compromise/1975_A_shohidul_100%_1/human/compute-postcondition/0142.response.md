Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the input split by spaces, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-2` are less than or equal to the next element, and after executing the if-else block, if `check_all` was initially `True`, it remains `True` if the condition holds, otherwise it becomes `False`. If `check_all` was initially `False`, it remains `False`. The output is 'NO' if the loop completes without finding a segment of the list `a` from index `i` to the end that satisfies both `check_all_new` and `new_all` being `True`, and 'NO' is printed.**
