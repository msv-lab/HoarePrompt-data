Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy the condition `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`.
