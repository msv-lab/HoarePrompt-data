Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The `func_2` function correctly parses the input to extract the necessary parameters for each test case. It handles the input reading and splitting into the required structure for `func_1`.
2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function iterates through each test case and calculates the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` for each element `a` in the array.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a`, it computes `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`. These computations ensure that `rx` and `ry` are non-negative and within the range `[0, x-1]` and `[0, y-1]` respectively.
   - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq`, it adds the frequency of this pair to the count. This count is then appended to the results list.
3. **Output**: The `func_1` function correctly returns the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
4. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - `func_2` correctly organizes the input and passes it to `func_1`.
   - `func_1` processes the input and returns the correct count of beautiful pairs.
   - `func_2` prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the logic in both functions appears to be correct and aligns with the requirements of the problem.
