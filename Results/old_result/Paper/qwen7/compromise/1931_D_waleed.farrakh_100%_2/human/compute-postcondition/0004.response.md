Output State: **`idx` is 1, `data` is a list containing the lines from `sys.stdin.read` split by lines, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their original values, `test_cases` is an empty list.**

The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `idx`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the only change is to the `idx` variable, which is set to 1. All other variables remain in their initial states.
