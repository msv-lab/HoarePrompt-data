Postcondition: `arr` must not be empty, `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `count` is increased by `freq[current_pair]` if `current_pair` is in `freq`, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`.
