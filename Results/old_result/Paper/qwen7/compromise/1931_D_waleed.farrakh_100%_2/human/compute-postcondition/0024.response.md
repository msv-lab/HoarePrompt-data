Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `idx` is 4
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop
- `test_cases` is an empty list
- `results` must contain at least one element

The print statement `print(result)` will print the value of the `result` variable. Since `results` must contain at least one element, we know that `result` is one of the elements in `results`.

Output: **result (where result is one of the elements in the results list)**
