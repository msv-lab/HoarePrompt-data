Output State: **`idx` is 3, `n` is an integer value, `x` is an integer value, `y` is an integer value, `data` is a list containing the lines from `sys.stdin.read` split by lines, `t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their original values, `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the `(idx + 1)`-th line of `data` and converting each element to an integer.**

This output state reflects that the `test_cases` list has been updated to include a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions from the initial state.
