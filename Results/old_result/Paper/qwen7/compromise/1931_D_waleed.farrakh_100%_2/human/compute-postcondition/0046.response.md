Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is the first element of the next `test_case`, `x` is the second element of the next `test_case`, `y` is the third element of the next `test_case`, `arr` is the fourth element of the next `test_case`, `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `freq`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
