The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `result`.

According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as there are elements in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.

Since no specific changes are made to `result` within the loop body (it is omitted), the value of `result` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is 0, `idx` is 4, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` must contain at least one element**
