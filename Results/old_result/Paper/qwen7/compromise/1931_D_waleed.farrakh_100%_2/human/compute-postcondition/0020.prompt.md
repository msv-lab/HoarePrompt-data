Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 1, `data` is a list containing the lines from `sys.stdin.read` split by lines, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their original values, `test_cases` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
    arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
    idx += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is 5, `n` is an integer value, `x` is an integer value, `y` is an integer value, `data` is a list containing the lines from `sys.stdin.read` split by lines, `t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their original values, `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the `(idx + 1)`-th line of `data` and converting each element to an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is now `t - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is increased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, and `test_cases` has been appended with a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
