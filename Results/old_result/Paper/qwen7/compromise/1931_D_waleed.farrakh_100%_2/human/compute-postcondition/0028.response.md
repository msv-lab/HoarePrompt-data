Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `idx` is 4
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop
- `test_cases` is an empty list
- `results` must contain at least one element

The `print(result)` statement will print the value of the `results` variable. Since `results` must contain at least one element, but no specific value for `results` is provided other than it having at least one element, we cannot determine the exact value of `results`.

Output: **result (where result is the value of the results variable, which must contain at least one element)**
