Output State: `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after processing all elements in `test_cases`. `count` is the total sum of all occurrences where the pair `(rx, ry)` matches any previously seen pair `(rx, ry)`, where `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`. `freq` is a dictionary that stores the frequency of each unique pair `(rx, ry)` and `(a % x, a % y)` encountered during the entire loop execution. `current_pair` is the last pair considered in the loop, which is `(a % x, a % y)` for the last element `a` in the last `arr`. After all iterations, `test_cases` will be an empty list since all its elements have been processed.

In summary, `results` will contain the aggregate count of matching pairs `(rx, ry)` across all arrays specified in `test_cases`, and `freq` will hold the frequency of each unique pair encountered.
