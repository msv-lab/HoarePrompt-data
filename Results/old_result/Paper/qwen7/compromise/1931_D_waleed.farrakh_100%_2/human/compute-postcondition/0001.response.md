Output State: **`data` is a list containing the lines from `sys.stdin.read` split by lines, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().splitlines()` reads multiple lines from standard input and splits them into a list. However, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state. The `data` variable is now a list containing the lines read from `sys.stdin.read`, split by lines.
