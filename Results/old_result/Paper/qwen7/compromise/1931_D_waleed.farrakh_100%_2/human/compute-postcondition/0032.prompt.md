You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n, x, and y are integers for each test case such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; arr is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the list, and the length of arr is n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `idx` is equal to `2 * t` which is 4 (since `t` is 0), `n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple being `(n, x, y, arr)` where `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as described above.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` becomes 0 because it was decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reached 0. The index `idx` will be 4 since it increments by 2 in each iteration and we start with `t` as 1, making it go through 3 iterations in total. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The list `test_cases` will contain `t` (which is 0) tuples, but since `t` is 0, `test_cases` will be an empty list.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `idx` is 4, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` contains at least 3 elements.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged at 0, `idx` remains at 4, and `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their state from the last iteration of the loop. The `test_cases` list remains empty since it was not modified within the loop. The key change is that the `results` list now contains at least 3 elements, as the loop iterated at least 3 times to produce these outputs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), a list arr (of length n containing integers between 1 and 10^9), and two integers n, x, and y (with n between 2 and 2⋅10^5, and x and y between 1 and 10^9). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
