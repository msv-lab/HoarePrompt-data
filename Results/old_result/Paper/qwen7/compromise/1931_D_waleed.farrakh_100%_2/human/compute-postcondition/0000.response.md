Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers for each test case such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the list, and the length of `arr` is n; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. It only changes what `input` refers to. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain the same as the initial state.
