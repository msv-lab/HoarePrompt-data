Postcondition: `arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `count` is increased by 1; `freq[current_pair]` is set to either 1 or incremented by 1.
