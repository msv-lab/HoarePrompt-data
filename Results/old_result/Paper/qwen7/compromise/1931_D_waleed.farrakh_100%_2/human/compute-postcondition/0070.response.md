Output State: **`arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `count` is increased by `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged; `current_pair` is updated to (a % x, a % y).**

Explanation: The code `current_pair = a % x, a % y` updates the value of `current_pair` to be the tuple `(a % x, a % y)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
