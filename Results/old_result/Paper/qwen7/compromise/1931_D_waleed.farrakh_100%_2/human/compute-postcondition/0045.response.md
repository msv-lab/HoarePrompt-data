Output State: **`n` is the first element of the next `test_case`, `x` is the second element of the next `test_case`, `y` is the third element of the next `test_case`, `arr` is the fourth element of the next `test_case`, `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `freq` is created and initialized as an empty dictionary.
