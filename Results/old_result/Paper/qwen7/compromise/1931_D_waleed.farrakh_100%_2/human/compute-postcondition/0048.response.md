Output State: **`arr` is the fourth element of the next `test_case` and must contain at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `rx` using the formula `(-a % x + x) % x`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `x`, the expression for `rx` remains as given. The variable `arr` is not affected by this calculation, so it retains its initial state.
