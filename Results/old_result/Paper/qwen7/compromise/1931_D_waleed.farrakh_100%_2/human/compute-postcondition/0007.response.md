Output State: **`idx` is 3, `n` is an integer value, `x` is an integer value, `y` is an integer value, `data` is a list containing the lines from `sys.stdin.read` split by lines, `t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their original values, `test_cases` is an empty list, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the `(idx + 1)`-th line of `data` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))` creates a new list `arr` by converting each element in the split result of the `(idx + 1)`-th line of `data` into an integer.
- Since `idx` is initially 2, `data[idx + 1]` refers to the third line of `data`.
- The value of `idx` is updated to `3` because the operation is performed on the next line after the current `idx` value.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `data`, `t`, `test_cases`, and `arr`) retain their original values except for `arr`, which is now a list of integers derived from the third line of `data`.
