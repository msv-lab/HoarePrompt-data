Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is the first character in the string `s.strip()`, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s.strip()` and has more than one unique character, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s.strip()` with the first half of `s.strip()`, `isreverse` is the reversed version of the string `s.strip()`. If `newstr` is not equal to the original string `s`, then `newstr` remains unchanged. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, and `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, then `isreverse` remains unchanged. If `newstr` is equal to `s` and `isreverse` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is set to the reversed version of `s`.
