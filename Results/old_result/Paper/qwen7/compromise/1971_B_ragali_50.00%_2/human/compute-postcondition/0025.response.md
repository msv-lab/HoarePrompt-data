Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is the last character of the original string `s` after all iterations, `s` is an empty string, `a` contains all unique characters from the original string `s`, and the length of set `a` is greater than 1; `newstr` is the reverse of the original string `s`, and `newstr` is equal to `s`. If the current value of `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, then `isreverse` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `isreverse` is equal to `s`.
