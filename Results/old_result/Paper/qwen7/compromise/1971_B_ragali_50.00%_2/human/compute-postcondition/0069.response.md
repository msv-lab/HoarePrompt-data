Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is the last character in the string `s.strip()`, `a` is a set containing the element `i`, `newstr` is either an empty string or equal to `s.strip()`**

Explanation: The code `a.add(i)` adds the element `i` to the set `a`. Since `a` was already a set containing the element `i` (because of the initial state), adding `i` again does not change the set. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
