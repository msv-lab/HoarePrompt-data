Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `t`, `s` is a non-empty stripped input string, `a` contains the element `i`**.

Explanation: The code `a.add(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is equal to `t`) to the set `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, `i` is still `t`, `s` is still a non-empty stripped input string, and `a` now contains the element `i`.
