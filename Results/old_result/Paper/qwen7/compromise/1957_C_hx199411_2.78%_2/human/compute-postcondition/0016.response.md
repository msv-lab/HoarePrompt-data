Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is either 1 or 2. After executing `num += 1`, `num` will be either 2 or 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged.
