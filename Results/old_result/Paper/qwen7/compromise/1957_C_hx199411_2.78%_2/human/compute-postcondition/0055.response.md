Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
