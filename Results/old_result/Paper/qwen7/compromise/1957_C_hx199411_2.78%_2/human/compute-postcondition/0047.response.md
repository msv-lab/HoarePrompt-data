Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the situation:

1. `t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1 (though it does not affect the `dp` calculation).
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `k` is an input integer.
4. `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k.
5. `i` is initially set to `m`, and since `m` is defined as `n - num`, `i` is also `n - num`.
6. `c` and `r` are integers from the input split (though they do not affect the `dp` calculation).
7. `m` is `n - num` and is greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 1.
8. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, except for `dp[1]` which is set to 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` has been updated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, where `m = n - num`.

Given the formula for updating `dp[i]`:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

We know:
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`

For `i` from 3 to `m`:
- Each `dp[i]` is computed based on the previous two elements in the list.

Since `m` is `n - num` and `m` is at least 3, the `dp` list will contain values up to `dp[m]`.

Therefore, the value printed will be `dp[n - num]`.

Output: **dp[n - num]**
