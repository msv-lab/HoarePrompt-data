Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is `n - num`
- `i` will be equal to `k`
- `num` will be the sum of increments based on the condition in the loop
- `c` and `r` will be the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop
- `m` equals to 1

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1.

Output: **1**
