Output State: **`dp[i + 1]` is updated to `(dp[i] + (i) * dp[i - 1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `m` is `m`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**.

This means that the value of `dp[i]` has been updated according to the given formula, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` has also been incremented by 2.
