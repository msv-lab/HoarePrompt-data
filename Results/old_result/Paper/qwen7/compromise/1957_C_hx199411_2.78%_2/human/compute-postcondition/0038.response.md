Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is 3.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[2]` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
