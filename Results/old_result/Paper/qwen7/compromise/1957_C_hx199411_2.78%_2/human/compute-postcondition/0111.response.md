Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `num` is `num + 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2. Since `i` is `k + 1` and `k` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are also unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
