Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 3 (since it was either 1 or 2 and then incremented by 2), `i` is 1, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The variable `num` was initially either 1 or 2 and was then incremented by 2, making its new value 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
