Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `num` is either `num + 1` if `c` equals `r`, or `num + 2` if `c` does not equal `r`.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by space, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `c` and `r` respectively. The values of `i`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for updating `num` (either `num + 1` or `num + 2`) based on whether `c` equals `r` is not applied here because the actual values of `c` and `r` are not known until the input is provided.
