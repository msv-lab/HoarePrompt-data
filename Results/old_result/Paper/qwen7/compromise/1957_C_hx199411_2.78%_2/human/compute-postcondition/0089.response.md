Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp[i + 1]` is updated to `(dp[i] + (i) * dp[i - 1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`
   - `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `m` is `m`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 3 to `m + 1`. This means `i` starts from 3 and goes up to `m + 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 2` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 each time, and it was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `dp[i + 1]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `dp[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - `m` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`dp[i + 1]` is updated to `(dp[i] + (i) * dp[i - 1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `m` is `m`**
