Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is greater than 0.
- `i` equals `k`.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the loop's final iteration.
- `num` is the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`.
- `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
- The condition `m` equals 0 is also true.

The print statement is simply `print(0)`. This means it will directly print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
