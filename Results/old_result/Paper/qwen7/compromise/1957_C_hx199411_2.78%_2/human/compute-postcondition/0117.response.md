Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is `num + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, `r`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The updated value of `num` is expressed as `num + 2`, indicating that it has been incremented by 2 from its previous value.
