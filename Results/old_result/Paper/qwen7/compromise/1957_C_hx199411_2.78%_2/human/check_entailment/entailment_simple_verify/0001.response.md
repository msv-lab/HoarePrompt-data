### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of coordinates `(r, c)` representing the positions of the rooks placed so far.

2. **Calculating the Number of Unaffected Positions:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of positions that are mirrored (i.e., `c == r`).
   - For each non-mirrored move, `num` is incremented by 2 because both a white and a black rook are placed.
   - This calculation ensures that the number of unique positions that are still available for rooks is `m = n - num`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `m` is 0, there are no positions left, so the program prints 0.
   - If `m` is 1, there is exactly one position left, so the program prints 1.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions.
   - The array `dp` is initialized to store the number of configurations for up to `m` positions.
   - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For each subsequent value of `i` from 3 to `m`, the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations.
   - This formula accounts for the fact that each new position can either be empty or contain a rook, and the previous configurations are combined accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `dp[m]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Verification:

- The logic for counting the number of unaffected positions is correct.
- The dynamic programming approach correctly calculates the number of configurations for the remaining positions.
- The edge cases are handled appropriately.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Base Cases:**
  - `dp[1] = 1`: One position can either be empty or have one rook.
  - `dp[2] = 3`: Two positions can have 0, 1, or 2 rooks (0, 1, 1, 2, 2).

- **Recurrence Relation:**
  - For `i >= 3`, `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
  - This formula considers:
    - Placing a rook in the `i-th` position (2 choices: white or black).
    - Not placing a rook in the `i-th` position (1 choice: empty).

### Conclusion:

The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. The program accurately counts the number of unaffected positions and uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions. The edge cases and modulo operation are handled correctly.

**Final: True**
