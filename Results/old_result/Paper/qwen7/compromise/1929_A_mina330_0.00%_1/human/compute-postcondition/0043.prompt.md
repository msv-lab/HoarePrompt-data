Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ntest is an input integer, and t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    kq = 0
    for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
        kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
    print(kq)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) // 2`, and `kq` is the sum of pairs of elements from the list `a` where each pair consists of an element from the end of the list and an element from the beginning of the list, until the middle of the list is reached.

To break it down further, `kq` will be the sum of differences between the last `len(a) // 2` elements and the first `len(a) // 2` elements of the list `a`. Specifically, if `len(a)` is even, `kq` will be calculated as follows:

\[ kq = (a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]) + (a[len(a) - 2] - a[1]) + \ldots + (a[len(a) // 2] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]) \]

If `len(a)` is odd, the middle element will not be included in the calculation of `kq`.

This final value of `kq` represents the net difference between corresponding pairs of elements from the start and end of the list, up to the midpoint.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2 - 1) - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]`, `a[len(a) - len(a) // 2 - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]`, and `a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2 + 1) - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 + 1]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) // 2 - 1`.

In simpler terms, `kq` will be the sum of the differences between the elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a`, up to the middle of the list. Specifically, it calculates the difference between each pair of elements symmetrically placed around the center of the list and sums these differences.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) // 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `kq` is the sum of the differences between each pair of elements from the end and the start of the list `a`, up to the middle of the list.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to half the length of the list (rounded down if necessary), because the loop runs from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`. The variable `kq` will contain the cumulative sum of the differences between corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list `a`, covering all pairs up to the middle of the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
