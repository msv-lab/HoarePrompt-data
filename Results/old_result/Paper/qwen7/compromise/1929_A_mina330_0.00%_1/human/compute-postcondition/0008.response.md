Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
   - Since `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < len(a) // 2`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `2`.
   - The condition `i < len(a) // 2` must still hold true for the next iteration to occur. Therefore, `len(a) // 2` must be greater than `2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `2`.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged.
   - `kq` is not affected by the loop and thus remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`**
