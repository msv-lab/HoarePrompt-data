Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `kq` is `a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[2]`.

4. **Next Iteration Check**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - Therefore, `len(a) // 2` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `kq` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop head variable `i`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[2]`**
