Output State: `kq` is the sum of `a[0] - a[len(a) // 2]`, `a[len(a) - len(a) // 2 - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]`, `a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2 + 1) - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 + 1]`, ..., up to `a[len(a) - len(a) // 2 - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]`.

In simpler terms, `kq` will be the sum of differences between elements from the start and end of the list `a`, excluding the middle element if the length of `a` is odd, as the loop iterates through the first half of the list, subtracting the corresponding element from the second half.
