Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a) // 2`, `kq` is the sum of pairs of elements from the list `a` where each pair consists of an element from the end of the list and an element from the beginning of the list, until the middle of the list is reached, and `a` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `i` and `kq` remain unchanged from their initial states.
