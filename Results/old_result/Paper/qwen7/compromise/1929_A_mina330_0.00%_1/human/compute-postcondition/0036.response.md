Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements
   - `kq` is `kq` plus the difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `a`

2. **Loop Definition:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `len(a) // 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2 (i.e., `i + 1`).

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - `i` should be set to 2.
   - The condition for `a` remains the same: `a` must be a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - The value of `kq` does not change as it is not part of the loop head.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements
   - `kq` remains unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` remains unchanged**
