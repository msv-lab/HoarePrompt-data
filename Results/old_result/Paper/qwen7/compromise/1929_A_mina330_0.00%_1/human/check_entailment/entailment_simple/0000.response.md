Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
2. The provided solution sorts the array \(a\) and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the start and the end of the sorted array. This approach works because sorting ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first, contributing maximally to the sum.
3. Specifically, the code iterates through the first half of the sorted array, pairing each element with its counterpart from the end of the array, and sums these differences.
4. This method correctly maximizes the beauty since the largest numbers contribute positively to the sum when paired with smaller numbers.
5. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
