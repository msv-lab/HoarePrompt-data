Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by subtracting the smallest half of the elements from the largest half. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
5
10 5 15 20 25
```

The program would sort the array to `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25]` and then calculate the beauty as `(25-20) + (20-15) + (15-10) + (10-5) = 15`. 

However, the correct maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[25, 10, 20, 5, 15]`, which gives a beauty of `(25-10) + (10-5) + (20-15) + (15-20) = 15 + 5 + 5 - 5 = 15 + 5 = 20`.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and fails to maximize the beauty in certain scenarios.
