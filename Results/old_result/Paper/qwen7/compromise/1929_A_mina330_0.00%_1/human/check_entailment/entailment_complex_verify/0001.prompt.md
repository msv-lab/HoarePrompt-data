You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `i` is equal to `len(a) // 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `kq` is the total sum of the differences between each pair of elements from the end and the start of the list `a`, covering all pairs up to the middle of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer t (number of test cases) followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the start and the end of the sorted list, up to the middle of the list. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - For example, for an array `[a1, a2, ..., an]`, the beauty is calculated as `(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - an-1)`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calculates the beauty by pairing the smallest and largest elements and summing their differences.
     - Specifically, it pairs `a[i]` with `a[n-i-1]` for `i` from `0` to `len(a)//2 - 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are paired together.
   - By pairing the smallest element with the largest, the next smallest with the next largest, etc., we ensure that the differences are maximized.
   - This approach works because the difference between the largest and smallest elements is the most significant, and subsequent smaller differences contribute positively to the overall sum.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has an even number of elements, the solution correctly pairs them.
   - If the array has an odd number of elements, the middle element is not used in the summation, but this does not affect the correctness since the middle element would have been paired with itself if included, contributing zero to the sum.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement confirm that the solution works for various scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and then pairing the smallest and largest elements.

Correctness: **True**
