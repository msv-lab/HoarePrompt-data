Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer from data at index 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is 1, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
