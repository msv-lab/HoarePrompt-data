### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element, it returns `'No'` unless all such pairs are checked and none are found, in which case it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the array and appending the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints each result on a new line.

3. **Function Summaries:**
   - `func_1` correctly checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case.

4. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted and does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through the specified operation.
   - However, the function `func_1` actually does consider the possibility of rearranging the array through the specified operation. It checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by ensuring no element is greater than the next element, which implicitly considers all possible splits and swaps.

Given the problem description and the function summaries, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. The function `func_1` indeed checks if the array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
