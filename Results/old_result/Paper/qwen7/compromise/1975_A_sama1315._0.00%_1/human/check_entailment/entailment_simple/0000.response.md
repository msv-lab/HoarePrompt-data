### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The provided solution attempts to solve this by checking if the array is already sorted or if it has only one inversion (a pair of elements that are out of order).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If the array is already sorted (`all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`), it returns `'Yes'`.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there is exactly one inversion (`any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`). If there is exactly one inversion, it means the array can be split and swapped to become sorted, so it returns `'Yes'`. If there are no inversions or more than one inversion, it returns `'No'`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - Reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1` on the array and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles arrays with no inversions (already sorted).
   - It correctly identifies arrays with exactly one inversion.
   - It correctly identifies arrays with more than one inversion.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound for the given problem constraints.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by the specified operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
