Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `[u, v]` is a list of two integers obtained from input, and the edge `(u-1, v-1)` has been added to the tree, and now `[u, v]` is assigned the values of two integers input by the user.**

The code `map(int, input().split())` takes the input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the list `u` and `v`. The initial conditions of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `u, v` now holds the integers input by the user.
