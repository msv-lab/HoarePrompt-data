Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`; `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged; `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`; `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now equal to the original `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.**

This means that the value of `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated based on whether `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`. If it is, then `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
