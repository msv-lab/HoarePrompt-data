Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 2; `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: Initially, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. After that, the code further increments `tree.vertices[v].good_components` by 1. Since `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged, the final state is that `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 2, while `tree.vertices[u].good_components` stays the same as its initial value.
