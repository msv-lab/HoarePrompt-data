Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `[u, v]` is a list of two integers obtained from input, and the edge (u-1, v-1) has been added to the tree.**

Explanation: The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` to the tree. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `[u, v]` remains as input. The edge `(u-1, v-1)` is now part of the tree.
