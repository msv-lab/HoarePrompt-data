Output State: The stack contains all tuples `(u, False)` where `u` is a child of `v`, and potentially one tuple `(u, True)` if a child's `remaining_size` met the condition `>= x` at some point during the loop's execution. All children of vertex `v` have been processed, and the stack now holds the final state of the traversal.

In simpler terms, the stack now contains tuples for all children of vertex `v`, marked as `(u, False)`. If any child's `remaining_size` was found to be greater than or equal to `x` during the loop, there might be a single tuple `(u, True)` in the stack. The loop has completed its execution, and all vertices have been processed.
