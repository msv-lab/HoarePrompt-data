Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`; `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'; if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1; otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to be `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In more natural language, the output state is:

- `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
- `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.
- If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to be its current value plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
