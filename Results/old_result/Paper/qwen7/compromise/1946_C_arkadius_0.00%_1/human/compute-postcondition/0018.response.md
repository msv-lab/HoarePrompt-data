Output State: **`beg`, `end`, and `mid` are adjusted based on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, and `mid` is now equal to (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2.**

This means that the value of `mid` has been updated to be the ceiling of the average of `beg` and `end`. The values of `beg` and `end` remain unchanged from their previous state, and `mid` is recalculated based on these values. The function `func_3` is called with the updated `mid` value, but its outcome does not affect the variables listed in the output state.
