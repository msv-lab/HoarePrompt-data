Output State: **The program returns the value of `beg` (or `end`) which is the point where the binary search converges, meaning `beg` and `end` are equal after the loop terminates.**

This means that after the binary search process, the values of `beg` and `end` have narrowed down to a single point where they are equal, and this common value is returned.
