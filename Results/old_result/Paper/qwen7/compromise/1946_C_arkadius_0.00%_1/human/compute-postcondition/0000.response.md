Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `[n, k]` is updated to the values read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the standard input using the `map` function and `int` conversion. These values replace the existing values of `n` and `k`. The `tree` instance and its methods remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` and retains the original state of the `tree` instance.
