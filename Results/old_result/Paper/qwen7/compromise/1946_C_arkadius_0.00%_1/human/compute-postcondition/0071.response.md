Output State: **`stack` contains (v, True) and `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(v, True)` to the `stack`. This means that the `stack` now contains this new tuple along with whatever was previously in the `stack`. The values of `v` and `postorder` remain unchanged from their initial states.
