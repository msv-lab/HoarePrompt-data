Output State: **`stack` contains the tuples `(u, False)`, `(u, False)`, `(next_u, False)`, and `(u, False)`**.

Explanation: The initial state of `stack` contains three tuples: `(u, False)`, `(u, False)`, and `(next_u, False)`. The code snippet `stack.append((u, False))` appends another tuple `(u, False)` to the stack. Therefore, the updated stack contains four tuples as mentioned above.
