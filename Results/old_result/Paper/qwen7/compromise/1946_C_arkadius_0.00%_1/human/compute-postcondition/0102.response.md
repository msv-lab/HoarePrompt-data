Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will accumulate the good components from all child vertices of `v`. Specifically, for each child vertex `u`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. Additionally, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1. The `remaining_size` of `v` will be the sum of its own `remaining_size` and the `remaining_size` of all its child vertices.**
