Postcondition: `beg`, `end`, and `mid` are adjusted based on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true, `beg` will be equal to `mid` and `end` and `mid` are further adjusted accordingly. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns false, `end` will be set to `mid - 1` and `beg`, `end`, and `mid` are adjusted accordingly.
