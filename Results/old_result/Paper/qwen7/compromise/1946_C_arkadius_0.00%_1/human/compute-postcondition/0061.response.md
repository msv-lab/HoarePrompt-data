Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by either 2 or by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, depending on whether `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
