Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The stack contains tuples \((u, False)\) appended to it three times, forming a list \([(u, False), (u, False), (u, False)]\). Here, each \((u, False)\) represents a vertex \(u\) with its second element being \(False\), indicating that none of these vertices have been processed yet. The variable \(v\) is the last child of the last processed vertex before the loop started, and \(tree.vertices[v].children\) is empty. The postorder traversal is being performed.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either 1 or `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, depending on whether `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is updated to include either `tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`), or `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus the original `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size < x`). `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is updated to include the remaining size of the next child `u`. Additionally, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size < x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is now equal to the original `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is updated to either `tree.vertices[v].good_components' + 1` or `tree.vertices[v].good_components' + tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, depending on whether `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is updated to include the remaining size of `u`, and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is used in the condition to update `tree.vertices[v].good_components'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
