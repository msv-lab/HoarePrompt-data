Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Structure and Functions**:
   - The program uses a `Tree` class, but the definition of the `Tree` class is not provided. We assume it has methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and properties like `vertices`.
   - The main function `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum number \( x \).

2. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
   - It calls `func_3` to check if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` and `func_2` to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertices.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertices.

5. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function checks if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - It uses the results from `func_1`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_4` is correctly implemented. It adjusts the search range based on whether `func_3` returns `True` or `False`.

2. **Post-Order Traversal**:
   - The post-order traversal in `func_1` correctly accumulates the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.

3. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - The recursive calculation in `func_2` correctly propagates the results up the tree.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the tree is fully connected (i.e., no edges are removed) by checking if `good_components > k` or `good_components == k and remaining_size >= x`.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and constructs the tree.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
