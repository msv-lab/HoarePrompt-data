You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to narrow down the range between `beg` and `end` until they converge. After each iteration, `mid` is recalculated as the midpoint of the current range. Depending on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, either `beg` or `end` is updated. Eventually, when `beg` equals `end`, the condition `beg < end` fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, both `beg` and `end` will hold the same value, which is the result of the binary search performed by the loop.
    return beg
    #The program returns the value of `beg` (or `end`) which is the point where the binary search converges, meaning `beg` and `end` are equal after the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges `k` to be removed such that 1 ≤ k < n. It performs a binary search to find a point where the condition converges, meaning the values of `beg` and `end` are equal after the loop terminates, and returns this converged value.

Each test case starts with two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree.

    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and the `tree` object contains `n-1 + k` edges, as all possible edges between `n` vertices have been added and `k` edges have been removed.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `tree` object will have exactly `n-1 + k` edges, because initially it would have `n-1` edges (a tree with `n` vertices always has `n-1` edges), and then `k` edges are removed, resulting in `n-1 + k` edges in total. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the list `[u, v]` represents the last pair of vertices for which an edge was added before `k` edges were removed.

    #This is printed: func_4(tree, n, k) (where tree is an object representing the tree with n-1 + k edges, n is the number of vertices in the tree, and k is the number of edges to be removed)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data from standard input to construct a tree with a specified number of vertices and edges. It then removes a specified number of edges from the tree and returns the result of another function `func_4` applied to the modified tree, along with the original number of vertices and edges to be removed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Structure and Functions**:
   - The program uses a `Tree` class, but the definition of the `Tree` class is not provided. We assume it has methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and properties like `vertices`.
   - The main function `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum number \( x \).

2. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
   - It calls `func_3` to check if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` and `func_2` to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertices.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertices.

5. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function checks if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - It uses the results from `func_1`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_4` is correctly implemented. It adjusts the search range based on whether `func_3` returns `True` or `False`.

2. **Post-Order Traversal**:
   - The post-order traversal in `func_1` correctly accumulates the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.

3. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - The recursive calculation in `func_2` correctly propagates the results up the tree.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the tree is fully connected (i.e., no edges are removed) by checking if `good_components > k` or `good_components == k and remaining_size >= x`.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and constructs the tree.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).
