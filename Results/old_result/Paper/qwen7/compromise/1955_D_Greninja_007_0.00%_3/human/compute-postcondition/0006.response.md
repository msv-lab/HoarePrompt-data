Output State: `window_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the sliding window of size `m` over the list `a`, excluding the elements that have been removed when their count reaches zero. `b_freq` remains a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list `b`. `a` and `b` remain as lists of integers with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, and `k` remains an integer satisfying `1 <= k <= m`. `good_subarrays` is the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` for which the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq` is greater than or equal to `k`.
