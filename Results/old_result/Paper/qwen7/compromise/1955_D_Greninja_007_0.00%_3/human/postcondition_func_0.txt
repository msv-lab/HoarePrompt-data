The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), `k` (an integer), and `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a`). It returns the count of subarrays in `a` of length `m` (where `m` is the length of list `b` and `m <= n`) where the number of elements that appear at least as many times in both `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.
