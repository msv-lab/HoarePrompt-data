Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**: The program calculates the paths taken by Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p`. This part is correctly implemented, ensuring that each player's path is traced accurately.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their respective paths. It correctly accumulates the scores by considering the number of moves remaining (`k - i`).

4. **Comparison and Output**: The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and outputs the correct result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') based on the comparison.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where `k` might be less than the length of the path, ensuring that only relevant scores are considered.

Given the above points, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and correctly determines the winner of the game for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
