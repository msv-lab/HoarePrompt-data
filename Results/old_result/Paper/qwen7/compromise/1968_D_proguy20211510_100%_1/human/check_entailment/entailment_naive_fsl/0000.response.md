Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where a player revisits a position multiple times during their path. This can lead to incorrect scores because the program only considers the last visit to a position for scoring, rather than all visits.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

In this case:
- Bodya starts at position 3 and moves to position 2.
- Sasha starts at position 2 and moves to position 1.

The program calculates the scores as follows:
- Bodya's score: \(5 + 7 = 12\)
- Sasha's score: \(2 + 7 = 9\)

However, if Bodya revisits position 2, his score would be \(5 + 5 + 7 = 17\), which is higher than the calculated score. Similarly, if Sasha revisits position 1, her score would also be higher.

To fix this, the program needs to account for all visits to each position, not just the last one.
