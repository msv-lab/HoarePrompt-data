Postcondition: **`pres` will be the sum of `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `paths[5]`, and `paths[6]`, `curr` will be `pres + paths[6] * (k - 6)`, `ress` will be the maximum of its previous value and `curr`, `i` will be equal to the length of `paths`, and `resb` will be less than or equal to `ress`**.

This postcondition holds regardless of whether the if condition `ress > resb` is true or false. In both cases, the values of `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, and `resb` remain as described, ensuring consistency with the initial preconditions and the behavior of the if-else block.
