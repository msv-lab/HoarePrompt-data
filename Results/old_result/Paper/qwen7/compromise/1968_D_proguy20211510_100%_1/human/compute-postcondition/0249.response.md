Output State: `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to within the loop, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing multiple occurrences of `a[pb - 1]` depending on how many times the loop executed, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` remains 1, indicating that the node has been visited.

This final state reflects that the loop continues to append `a[pb - 1]` to `pathb` until `vis[pb - 1]` equals 1, at which point the loop breaks. The variable `pb` is updated within the loop but retains its last value once the loop exits. The other variables (`i`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `pathb`, and `paths`) maintain their states as they were last updated within the loop's body.
