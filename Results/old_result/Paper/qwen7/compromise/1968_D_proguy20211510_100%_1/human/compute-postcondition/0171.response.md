Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(pathb)` is a positive integer, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`**.

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. Given that `curr` is defined as `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, which simplifies to `preb + pathb[0]`, and `preb` is also `preb + pathb[0]`, the value of `curr` is effectively `preb + pathb[0]`. Since `resb` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr`, `resb` will now hold the larger of its original value and `preb + pathb[0]`. The values of `i`, `len(pathb)`, `curr`, `preb`, and `pathb[0]` remain unchanged.
