Output State: **`pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[4] * (k - 4)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, and `paths` length is greater than 4.**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. The values of `pres` and `paths` remain unchanged.
