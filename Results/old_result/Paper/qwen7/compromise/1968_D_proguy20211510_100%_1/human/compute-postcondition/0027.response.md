Output State: **`pathb` is equal to the value of `p[pb - 1] - 1`, `a` retains its original values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `pathb` was being updated. The values of `a` remain unchanged, and `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. The state of `pathb` is now fixed to the value of `p[pb - 1] - 1`, and the loop or conditional block is exited.
