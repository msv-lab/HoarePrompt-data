Output State: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `vis` will have a 1 at the index `ps - 1`, `paths` will contain all the nodes traversed before encountering a previously visited node, other variables such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `alpha`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `pathb`, and `vis[pb - 1]` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop or their initial values if they were not modified within the loop.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `preb` and `pres` to 0. This does not affect the values of the existing variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `resb`, `ress`, `vis`, `paths`, and other variables remain unchanged.
