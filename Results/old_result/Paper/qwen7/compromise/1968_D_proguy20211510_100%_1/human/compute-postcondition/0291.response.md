Output State: **`resb` is equal to `max(resb, curr)`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i) + pathb[i]`, and we are inside the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `preb` by adding `pathb[i]` to it. The other variables (`resb`, `curr`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Since the code does not explicitly break out of the loop or if statement, we assume it continues inside the current loop or if statement. Therefore, the updated value of `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, and the other conditions and values remain as they were.
