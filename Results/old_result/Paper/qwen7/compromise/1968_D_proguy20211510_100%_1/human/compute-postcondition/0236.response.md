Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and the value of `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. All the variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
