Output State: **`preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `curr` is undefined, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is now the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now a list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `preb` and `pres`, both to 0. All other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `preb` and `pres`, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
