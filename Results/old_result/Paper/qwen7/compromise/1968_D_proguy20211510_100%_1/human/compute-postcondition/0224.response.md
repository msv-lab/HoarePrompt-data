Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means the loop variable `_` is being used, but it does not affect the states of `i`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, or `resb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer. However, since the loop head does not directly reference `i`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, or `resb`, these variables' states are not directly modified by the loop itself.

3. **Determine the initial conditions for the next iteration**: Since the loop does not modify the values of `i`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, or `resb` within its body, the values of these variables remain the same from the previous iteration to the next iteration.

Given the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration, the states of the variables are:
- `i` is equal to `len(paths)`
- `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`
- `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`
- `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`
- If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.

Since the loop does not modify these variables, the states remain the same for the next iteration.

**State: **`i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, and if `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.**
