Output State: **`pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers converted from their respective input values, `vis` is a list of n zeros, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `vis` with `n` elements, each set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
