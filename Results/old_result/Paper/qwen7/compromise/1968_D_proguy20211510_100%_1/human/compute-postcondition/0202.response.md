Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`; `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1))`; `pres` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1]`; `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`**.

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. The values of `i`, `curr`, `pres`, and `paths[i_end + 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
