Output State: **`resb` is equal to `max(resb, curr)`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i+1] * (k - (i+1))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `resb` and `curr` were being updated. The values of `resb` and `curr` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed, and we simply note that the execution breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
