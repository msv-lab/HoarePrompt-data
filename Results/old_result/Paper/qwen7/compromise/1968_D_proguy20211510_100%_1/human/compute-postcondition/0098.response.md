Output State: **`pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3) + paths[i + 1] + paths[i]`, `curr` is equal to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `i` is `i + 1`, and if `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `pres += paths[i]` increments the value of `pres` by `paths[i]`. The other variables (`curr`, `ress`, `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition `if k < i + 1` remains the same, meaning if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
