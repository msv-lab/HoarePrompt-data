Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1` which is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is an integer from input, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1` which is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is unchanged, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, and `paths` is an unchanged empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1` which is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]`, and `paths` is an unchanged empty list. If `vis[pb - 1]` equals 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `pathb` contains the last element of `a` at index `p[pb - 1] - 1`, `a` retains its original values. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, then `pathb` is equal to the value of `p[pb - 1] - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `vis[pb - 1]` is not 1, then no changes are made to `pathb`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
