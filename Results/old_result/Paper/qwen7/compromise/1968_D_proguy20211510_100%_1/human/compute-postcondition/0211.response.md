Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` will be `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` will be the sum of all elements in `paths`, and `ress` will store the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the length of `paths`, `curr` will hold the final computed value based on the last element of `paths`, `pres` will be the sum of all elements in `paths`, and `ress` will store the highest value encountered during the loop's execution.
