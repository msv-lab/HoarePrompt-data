Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(len(paths))`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(paths)`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3)`
   - `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[4] * (k - 4)`
   - `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`
   - `paths` length is greater than 4

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(paths)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `len(paths)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Since `len(paths)` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `pres` and `curr` are dependent on the value of `paths[4]` and `k`, and they do not change based on the loop iteration directly.
   - `ress` is updated based on the comparison between `ress` and `curr`, but it does not affect the loop condition.
   - `paths` length remains the same unless modified outside the loop, so it stays greater than 4.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `i` and `len(paths)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[4] * (k - 4)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `paths` length is greater than 4**
