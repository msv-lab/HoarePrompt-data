Output State: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `vis` will have a 1 at the index `ps - 1`, `paths` will contain all the nodes traversed before encountering a previously visited node, other variables such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `alpha`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `pathb`, and `vis[pb - 1]` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop or their initial values if they were not modified within the loop.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `resb` and `ress`, both to 0. This does not affect the `vis` list or the `paths` list, which are updated during the loop. The `vis` list will have a 1 at the index `ps - 1` because the loop continues to execute until a previously visited node is encountered, and the `paths` list will contain all the nodes traversed before the loop breaks. All other variables remain unchanged.
