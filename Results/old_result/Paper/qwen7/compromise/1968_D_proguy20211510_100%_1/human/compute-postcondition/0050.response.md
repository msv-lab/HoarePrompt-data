Output State: `vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is updated to 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is the final value it reaches after following the links in the list `p` until a previously visited node is encountered, `ps` is updated to the final value of `p[ps - 1]` when the loop breaks, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` remains unchanged, `paths` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop, and the loop has terminated because `vis[ps - 1]` is 1.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `vis[ps - 1]` will be 1, indicating that the node `ps - 1` has been visited. The variable `ps` will hold the value of the last node visited before a previously visited node was encountered, and `paths` will contain a list of all nodes visited during the process.
