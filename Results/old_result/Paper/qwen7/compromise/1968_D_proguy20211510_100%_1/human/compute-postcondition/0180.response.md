Output State: **`curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `i` is 3, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1) + pathb[3]`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `curr`, `i`, `preb`, or `resb`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
