Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(pathb)`, `curr` will be `preb + pathb[len(pathb) - 1] * (k - len(pathb) + 1)`, `preb` will be the sum of `preb` and the cumulative product of `pathb` values from the start up to the last element multiplied by their respective coefficients, and `resb` will be the maximum value between `resb` and `curr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the length of `pathb`, `curr` will hold the final computed value based on the last iteration's calculation, `preb` will accumulate the sum of all elements in `pathb` adjusted by their respective positions, and `resb` will store the highest value encountered during the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `curr` is equal to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is increased by `paths[i]`, `k` is an integer, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, and if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i_end + 1`; `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1))`; `pres` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1]`; `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i_end + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1) - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] + paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `ress` is updated to be the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
