Output State: **`pathb` contains the last element of `a` at index `p[pb - 1] - 1`, `a` retains its original values, and `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `pb` to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. The initial state tells us that `pathb` contains the last element of `a` at index `pb - 1`. After executing the code, `pathb` now contains the last element of `a` at the new index `pb - 1`, which is `p[pb - 1] - 1`. The values of `a` and the original `pb` (now stored in `p[pb - 1]`) are unchanged.
