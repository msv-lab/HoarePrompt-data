Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, and `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.
