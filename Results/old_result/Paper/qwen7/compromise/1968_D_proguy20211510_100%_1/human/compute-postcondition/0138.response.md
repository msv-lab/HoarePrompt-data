Output State: **`vis` is now `[1] + [0] * (n - 1)`, `pathb` is unchanged, `paths` is an empty list, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as integers converted from their respective input values, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, the list `a` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `vis` with a single '1' at index `pb - 1`, indicating that the node has been visited. This is represented as `[1] + [0] * (n - 1)`. All other variables and lists remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
