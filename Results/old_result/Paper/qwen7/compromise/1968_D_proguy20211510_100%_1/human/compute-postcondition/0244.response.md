The `while True` loop does not have any condition based on the variables inside the loop head to control its execution. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the variables listed in the current state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` remains unchanged, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
