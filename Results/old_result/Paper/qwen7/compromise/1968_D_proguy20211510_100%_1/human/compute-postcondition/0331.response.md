Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on inputs such as a positive integer `t`, and for each test case, positive integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` with specific constraints, a permutation `p` of length `n`, and an array `a` of positive integers. It returns different values based on the conditions specified.**
