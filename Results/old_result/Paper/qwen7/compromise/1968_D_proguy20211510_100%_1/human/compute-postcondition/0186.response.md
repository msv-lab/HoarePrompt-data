Output State: `i` is equal to `len(pathb)`, `resb` is the maximum value accumulated during each iteration of the loop, `curr` is not defined after the loop since the loop has ended, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` multiplied by their respective `(k - i)` factors, and the loop has completed all its iterations without breaking early.

To explain further, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of `pathb`. The variable `resb` will hold the maximum value calculated during any iteration of the loop using the formula `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. The variable `curr` is no longer defined because the loop has finished executing. The variable `preb` will contain the cumulative sum of the products of each element in `pathb` with `(k - i)` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pathb) - 1`.
