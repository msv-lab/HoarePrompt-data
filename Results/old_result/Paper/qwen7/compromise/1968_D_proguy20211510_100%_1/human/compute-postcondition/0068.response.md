Output State: **`i` is 3, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `k` is less than `i + 1`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - i) + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. However, since the exact values of `resb` and `curr` are not specified, we cannot determine the new value of `resb` precisely. All other variables (`i`, `preb`, `k`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
