Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array is already non-decreasing, but it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through valid splits and swaps.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
5
7 9 2 2 3
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
No
Yes
Yes
```

However, the provided program would output:
```
No
No
Yes
```

This is incorrect because for the second test case `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, the program fails to recognize that the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. Specifically, splitting into `x = [7]` and `y = [9, 2, 2, 3]` and then swapping them results in `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`, which is not sorted but can be further adjusted by another swap to achieve a sorted array.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.
