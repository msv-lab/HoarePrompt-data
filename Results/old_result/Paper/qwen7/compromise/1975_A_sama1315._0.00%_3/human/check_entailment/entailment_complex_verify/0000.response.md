### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to understand its behavior and compare it with the expected requirements.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If the array is already sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
- Otherwise, it returns `'No'`.

Here is the function again for reference:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
```

The function only checks if the array is already sorted. It does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through valid splits and swaps. This is a critical flaw because the problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts, not just if it is already sorted.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, the length of each array `n`, and the array elements.
- It then calls `func_1` on each array and collects the results.

Here is the function again for reference:
```python
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the example test case provided:

Input:
```
3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
5
7 9 2 2 3
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
No
Yes
Yes
```

- For the first test case `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, the array is not sorted, and `func_1` returns `'No'`. This is correct.
- For the second test case `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, the array is not sorted, and `func_1` returns `'No'`. However, the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. For example, splitting into `x = [7]` and `y = [9, 2, 2, 3]` and then swapping them results in `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`, which is not sorted but can be further adjusted by another swap to achieve a sorted array. `func_1` does not recognize this possibility.
- For the third test case `[1, 2, 3]`, the array is already sorted, and `func_1` returns `'Yes'`. This is correct.

Since `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted and does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through valid splits and swaps, the function is indeed incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

**Final: False**
