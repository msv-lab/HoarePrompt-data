Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in 12-hour format with AM/PM notation, based on the input times provided by the user. The exact times printed will depend on the inputs given during the loop executions. Each line will follow the format "h1 : m  time", where "h1" is the adjusted hour in 12-hour format, "m" is the original minutes, and "time" is either "AM" or "PM".
