You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of times provided as input, converting them from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It prints each converted time on a new line. The function does not return any value but outputs the transformed times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the conversion of times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, the program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to manually map each hour from 00 to 23 to its corresponding 12-hour format representation. However, this approach is inefficient and prone to errors, especially if new cases are added or existing ones modified.

A more robust solution would involve using the modulo operation to determine whether the time is in the AM or PM period and then adjusting the hour accordingly. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        (h1, m1) = (h, m)
        time = ''
        if int(h) >= 12:
            h1 = str(int(h) % 12)
            if h1 == '0':
                h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            time = 'AM'
        print(h1, ':', m1, ' ', time, sep='')
```

This version correctly handles all cases, including edge cases like `00:00` and `12:00`. The modulo operation ensures that hours greater than or equal to 12 are adjusted to their 12-hour equivalents, and the time is set to 'PM' or 'AM' accordingly.
