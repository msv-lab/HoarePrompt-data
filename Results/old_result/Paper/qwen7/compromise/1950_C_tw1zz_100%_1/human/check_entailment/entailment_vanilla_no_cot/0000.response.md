Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the conversion correctly for all possible times. Specifically, the logic for converting hours from 13 to 23 to their corresponding 12-hour format is flawed. Here's why:

1. The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to manually convert each hour from 13 to 23 to the corresponding hour in the 12-hour format. This approach is inefficient and error-prone.
2. A more efficient and correct way to handle this conversion is to use the modulo operator (`%`) to adjust the hour and then determine whether it is AM or PM based on the adjusted hour.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = str((int(h) % 12) or 12)  # Convert 24-hour to 12-hour format
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')
```

This version uses the modulo operator to correctly convert the hour and handles the AM/PM determination in a more concise manner.
