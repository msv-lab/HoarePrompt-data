You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM", where "h1" is the hour converted to 12-hour format, "m" is the minute, and "AM/PM" indicates whether it is morning or afternoon. The specific times printed depend on the inputs provided during the loop executions. Each line represents the transformed time from the input "hh:mm" into 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of times provided as input, converting them from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It prints each converted time on a new line. The function does not return any value but outputs the transformed times.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. It correctly handles the conversion of hours from 00 to 12 and sets the appropriate AM/PM indicator.
3. However, there are several issues with the implementation:
   - The code uses multiple `if` statements to handle each possible hour, which is inefficient and can be simplified.
   - The code does not account for the case where the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format, which should be "12:00 PM".
   - The code does not handle the case where the hour is 00 in the 24-hour format, which should be "12:00 AM".

Let's analyze the specific issues:

- For hours 01 to 09, the code correctly converts them to 12-hour format but incorrectly appends "AM" without considering that these could also be "PM" in certain contexts.
- For hours 10 to 12, the code correctly converts them to 12-hour format and appends "PM", but it fails to handle the special case of "12:00 PM".
- For hours 13 to 23, the code correctly converts them to 12-hour format and appends "PM", but it fails to handle the special case of "12:00 PM" when the hour is 24 (which should be "12:00 AM").
- For hour 00, the code incorrectly converts it to "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM".

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and will produce incorrect results for some inputs.
