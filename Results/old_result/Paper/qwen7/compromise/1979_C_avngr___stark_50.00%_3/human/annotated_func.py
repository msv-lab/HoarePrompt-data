#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list numbers contains n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `hcf` will hold the GCD of the entire list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the GCD of the current `hcf` value and the next element in the list, effectively combining all elements in the list through repeated application of the GCD operation.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list. Given a list of integers where each integer is between 2 and 20, the function calculates the GCD of all these integers and returns this value.
