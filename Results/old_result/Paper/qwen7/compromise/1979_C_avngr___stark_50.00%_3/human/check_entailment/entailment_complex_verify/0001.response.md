### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to verify the correctness based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculation of Total Bet Amount:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `m = k[0] * k[1] * ... * k[n-1]`.
   - This product represents the total amount of coins that would be returned if any one of the outcomes were to win.

3. **Determine Bets:**
   - The program computes the bets `c[i]` for each outcome as `c[i] = m / k[i]`.
   - These bets are then divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all `c[i]` values to ensure they are in their simplest form.

4. **Check Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the simplified bets is less than the total amount of coins that would be returned (`sum(c) < m / hcf`).
   - If the condition is met, it prints the simplified bets.
   - If not, it prints `-1`.

5. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 7`
   - Output: `27 41 12`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `27 + 41 + 12 = 80`, and the returns are `81`, `82`, and `84` respectively, which are all greater than 80.
   - The program correctly outputs `27 41 12`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 3 3`
   - Output: `1 1`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `1 + 1 = 2`, and the returns are `3` and `3`, both of which are greater than 2.
   - The program correctly outputs `1 1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25`, and the return is `25 * 5 = 125`, which is greater than 25.
   - However, the sum of bets equals the return, so the correct output should be `-1`.
   - The program incorrectly outputs `1 1 1 1 1` instead of `-1`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `6 7 9 3 17 9 13`
   - Output: `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `1989 + 1547 + 4641 + 819 + 1547 + 1071 = 10564`, and the returns are `13323`, `17022`, `13923`, `13923`, `17022`, and `25793`, all of which are greater than 10564.
   - The program correctly outputs `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `3 6 3 2`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `6 + 3 + 2 = 11`, and the returns are `36`, `18`, and `22`, all of which are greater than 11.
   - However, the sum of bets equals the return, so the correct output should be `-1`.
   - The program incorrectly outputs `1 1 1` instead of `-1`.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `5 9 4 6 8 3`
   - Output: `8 18 12 9 24`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 61`, and the returns are `81`, `36`, `54`, `72`, and `24`, all of which are greater than 61.
   - The program correctly outputs `8 18 12 9 24`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle edge cases correctly where the sum of bets equals the return, leading to incorrect outputs. Specifically, it should output `-1` in cases where the sum of bets equals the return, but it outputs the simplified bets instead.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
