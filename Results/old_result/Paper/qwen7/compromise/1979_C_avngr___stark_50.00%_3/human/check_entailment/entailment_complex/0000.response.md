Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. This involves finding a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i
   \]

2. **Key Insight**: To ensure the condition holds, the total bet should be less than the smallest product \(k_i \cdot x_i\). One effective approach is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_i\), as it allows us to find a set of bets that satisfies the condition.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program correctly computes the LCM of the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It then divides the LCM by each \(k_i\) to get a set of bets \(c_i\).
   - It checks if the sum of these bets is less than the LCM divided by the GCD of the multipliers.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to this value, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly computes the GCD of the list of multipliers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - This GCD is used to normalize the bets so they are relatively prime, ensuring the sum of the bets is minimized while still satisfying the condition.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where no valid distribution exists by checking if the sum of normalized bets exceeds the required threshold.
   - The constraints are respected, and the solution is efficient given the upper bounds on \(t\) and \(n\).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
