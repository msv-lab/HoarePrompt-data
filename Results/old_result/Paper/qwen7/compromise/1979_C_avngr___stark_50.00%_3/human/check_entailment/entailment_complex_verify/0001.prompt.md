You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list numbers contains n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `hcf` will hold the GCD of the entire list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the GCD of the current `hcf` value and the next element in the list, effectively combining all elements in the list through repeated application of the GCD operation.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list. Given a list of integers where each integer is between 2 and 20, the function calculates the GCD of all these integers and returns this value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculation of Total Bet Amount:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `m = k[0] * k[1] * ... * k[n-1]`.
   - This product represents the total amount of coins that would be returned if any one of the outcomes were to win.

3. **Determine Bets:**
   - The program computes the bets `c[i]` for each outcome as `c[i] = m / k[i]`.
   - These bets are then divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all `c[i]` values to ensure they are in their simplest form.

4. **Check Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the simplified bets is less than the total amount of coins that would be returned (`sum(c) < m / hcf`).
   - If the condition is met, it prints the simplified bets.
   - If not, it prints `-1`.

5. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 7`
   - Output: `27 41 12`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `27 + 41 + 12 = 80`, and the returns are `81`, `82`, and `84` respectively, which are all greater than 80.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 3 3`
   - Output: `1 1`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `1 + 1 = 2`, and the returns are `3` and `3`, both of which are greater than 2.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25`, and the return is `25 * 5 = 125`, which is greater than 25, but the sum of bets equals the return, so it should be `-1`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `6 7 9 3 17 9 13`
   - Output: `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `1989 + 1547 + 4641 + 819 + 1547 + 1071 = 10564`, and the returns are `13323`, `17022`, `13923`, `13923`, `17022`, and `25793`, all of which are greater than 10564.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `3 6 3 2`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `6 + 3 + 2 = 11`, and the returns are `36`, `18`, and `22`, all of which are greater than 11, but the sum of bets equals the return, so it should be `-1`.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `5 9 4 6 8 3`
   - Output: `8 18 12 9 24`
   - Explanation: The total bet is `8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 61`, and the returns are `81`, `36`, `54`, `72`, and `24`, all of which are greater than 61.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. It handles edge cases where no such distribution exists by printing `-1`. Therefore, the program is correct.
