Output State: **`hcf` is set to the first element of the list `numbers`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list `numbers` contains n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i.**

Explanation: The code initializes `hcf` (highest common factor) to the first element of the list `numbers`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `numbers` remain unchanged from their initial state.
