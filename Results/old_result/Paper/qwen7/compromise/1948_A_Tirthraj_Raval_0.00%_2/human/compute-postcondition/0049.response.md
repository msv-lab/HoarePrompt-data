Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2`, `pattern` is a list containing 'A' or 'B' depending on the value of `i % 2`, and `pattern` is an empty list before the append operation.**

Explanation: The variable `pattern` is appended with either 'A' or 'B' based on the value of `i % 2`. Since `i` is defined as `n // 2 + n % 2`, and `n` must be at least 2, `i` will be 1 (if `n` is even) or 2 (if `n` is odd). Thus, `i % 2` will be 1 (for both even and odd `n`), and `pattern` will contain 'B'. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
