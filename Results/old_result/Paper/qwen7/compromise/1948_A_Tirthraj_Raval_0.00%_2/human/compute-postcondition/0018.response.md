Output State: `i` is equal to `n // 2`; `pattern` is a list that alternates between 'A' and 'B' based on the value of `i`, starting with 'B' for `i=0`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n // 2`. The `pattern` list will contain alternating 'A's and 'B's, starting with 'B' if `i` starts from 0, and ending with the appropriate character based on the final value of `i`. Since `n` is even, the length of the `pattern` list will be exactly `n // 2`, and it will perfectly alternate between 'A' and 'B'.
