Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2`, and `pattern` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `pattern`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`. The value of `pattern` is now an empty list, and the conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
