Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format, reading `t` (the number of test cases) and then processing each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd (as explained in the problem statement).
3. If `n` is even, it constructs a string with alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, which ensures that every character except the first and last will be special (since they each have exactly one different neighbor). This meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.
4. The constructed string has a maximum length of `n`, which is at most 50, ensuring it fits within the constraints.
5. The program prints "YES" before printing the constructed string, which is consistent with the output format specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to be correct according to the problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
