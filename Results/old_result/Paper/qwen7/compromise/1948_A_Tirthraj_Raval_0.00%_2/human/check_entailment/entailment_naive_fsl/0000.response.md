Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as required. For example, consider `n = 6`. The generated pattern "ABABAB" has only 2 special characters (at positions 2 and 4), not 6. The pattern generation logic needs to ensure that the number of special characters matches `n`. Specifically, for even `n`, we need to place special characters in a way that ensures the exact count of special characters is met. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
