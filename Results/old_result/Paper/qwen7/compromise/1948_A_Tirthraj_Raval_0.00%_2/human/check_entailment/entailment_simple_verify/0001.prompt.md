You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: t equals 0, there exists at least one value of n that is an even integer and at least 2, and for each such n, the variable pattern is a string consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checking for Special Characters:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd (since special characters come in pairs).

3. **Generating the String:**
   - If `n` is even, the program prints "YES".
   - It then generates a pattern to create a string with exactly `n` special characters.
     - The pattern alternates between 'A' and 'B' in a specific way to ensure that each character is special.
     - The pattern is constructed by appending 'A' and 'B' in a repeating sequence, ensuring that each character has exactly one different neighbor.

4. **Constructing the Pattern:**
   - The pattern is built using a loop that runs `n // 2` times.
   - In each iteration, it appends 'A' and 'B' in a way that ensures the special character condition is met.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program outputs the pattern as a string.

### Verification:

- **Odd `n`:**
  - The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, no suitable string exists and prints "NO".

- **Even `n`:**
  - The program constructs a string where each character is special by alternating 'A' and 'B'.
  - Each character in the generated string will indeed have exactly one different neighbor, making it special.
  - The length of the generated string is `n`, which is at most 50 (as per the problem constraints).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both cases (odd and even `n`) and generates a suitable string for even `n`. Therefore, the given program is correct according to the problem description.
