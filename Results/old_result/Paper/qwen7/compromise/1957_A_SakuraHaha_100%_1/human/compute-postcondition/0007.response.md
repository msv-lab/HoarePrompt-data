Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in cnt.values():`. This means the loop iterates over the values of the dictionary `cnt`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the dictionary `cnt` must contain at least one value. If `cnt` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **List the relevant states**: The relevant states to adjust are the ones related to the loop head, which are `x`, `cnt`, and the values inside `cnt`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop iterates over `cnt.values()`, `cnt` must have at least one value for the loop to execute. We don't need to specify the exact value of `x` because the loop will iterate over all values in `cnt` as long as `cnt` is not empty.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `cnt` must have at least one value.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary (must have at least one key-value pair)**
