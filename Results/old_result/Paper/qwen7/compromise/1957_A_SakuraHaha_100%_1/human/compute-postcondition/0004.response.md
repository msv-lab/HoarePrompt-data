Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in a:`. Here, the objects involved are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is the variable used to iterate over the elements of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Once `a` is empty, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `x` is used to iterate over the elements of `a`, it will take on the values of the elements in `a` one by one.
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `ans` is not directly involved in the loop head, so its value (0) does not need to be adjusted.
   - `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, so its value (an integer between 1 and 100) does not need to be adjusted.
   - `n` is not directly involved in the loop head, so its value (an integer between 1 and 100) does not need to be adjusted.
   - `cnt` is not directly involved in the loop head, so its value (an empty dictionary) does not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `a`.

**State:**
- `a` must be a non-empty list of integers.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: **`a` must be a non-empty list of integers**.
