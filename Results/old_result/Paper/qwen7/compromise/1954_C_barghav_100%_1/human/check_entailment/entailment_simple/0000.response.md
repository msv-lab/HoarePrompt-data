Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the product of two numbers by swapping their digits.
2. The provided code attempts to sort the digits of `x` and `y` such that the digits of `x` are not greater than the corresponding digits of `y`. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the product.
3. The logic in the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the product. Specifically, the current implementation only ensures that no digit in `a` is greater than the corresponding digit in `b`, but it does not consider the overall product maximization.
4. For example, consider the test case `x = 23` and `y = 14`. The current logic would swap the digits to make `x = 21` and `y = 34`, resulting in a product of `72`. However, the optimal solution would be to keep `x = 23` and `y = 41`, which results in a higher product of `933`.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
