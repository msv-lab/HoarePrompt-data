Output State: **`rem` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced by `2 * (a[1] - a[0])`, `r` is `a[1] + k // (1 + 1)`**.

Explanation: The initial state shows that `rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` is reduced by `2 * (a[1] - a[0])`. The code updates `i` to `i + 1`, making `i` equal to 2. It also calculates `r` as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, which translates to `a[2] + k // 3` given `i` is now 2. However, since `a[2]` is not defined in the initial state, we keep it as `a[2]`. The value of `k` is already updated, so we include that in the output state.
