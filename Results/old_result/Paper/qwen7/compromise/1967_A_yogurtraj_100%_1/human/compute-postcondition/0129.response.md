Output State: **`rem` is either `(k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) % (i + 1)` or 0, `i` is either 1 or 3, `n` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`**

Explanation: The variable `y` is assigned the value of `n - 1 - i`. Given the initial conditions, `i` can be either 2 or 4. After executing the line `y = n - 1 - i`, `i` is reduced by 1, making it either 1 or 3. Additionally, `n` is reduced by 1, so `n` becomes `n - 2`. The values of `rem`, `k`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
