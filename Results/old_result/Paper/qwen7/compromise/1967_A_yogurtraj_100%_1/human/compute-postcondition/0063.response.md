Output State: **`k` is reduced by ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])), `i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The values of `k`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `k` is still reduced by ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])), `i` remains an integer, `a` remains a list of integers, and `r` is now equal to `a[i + 1]`.
