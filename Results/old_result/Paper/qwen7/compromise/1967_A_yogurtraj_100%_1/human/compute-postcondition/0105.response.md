Output State: **`rem` is k % 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and `r` is `a[0] + k // (0 + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `rem = k % (i + 1)` updates the value of `rem` to be the remainder when `k` is divided by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` is 1. Therefore, `rem` is now `k % 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
