Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `k` is decreased by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `2 * (a[2] - a[1])` given that `i` is now 1. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 1 and the expression `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))` is less than or equal to `k` remain valid post-execution.
