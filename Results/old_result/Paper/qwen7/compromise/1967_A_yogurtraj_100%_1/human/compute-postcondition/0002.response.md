Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
