Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 2
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `k` is updated based on the condition: if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` remains unchanged; otherwise, `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value.
   - `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`
   - `rem` is 0

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`, and currently `i` is 2, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Therefore, `i` should be updated to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 because the loop condition depends on `i < n - 1` and `i` is now 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` is updated to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

6. **States of Other Variables**:
   - The values of `a`, `k`, `r`, and `rem` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
