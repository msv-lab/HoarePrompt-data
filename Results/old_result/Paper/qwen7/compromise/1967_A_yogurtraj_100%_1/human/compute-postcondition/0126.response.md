Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `rem` is either `k % 3` or 0.
   - `i` is either 1 or 3.
   - `n` is `n - 1` and must still be greater than 1.
   - `k` is either 0 or reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.
   - `r` is either `a[1]` or `a[i + 1]`.

4. **Determine the Next Values for `i` and `n`**:
   - Since `i` is either 1 or 3, and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2 if `i` was 1, or 4 if `i` was 3.
   - `n` is `n - 1` and must still be greater than 1. Therefore, `n` will be `n - 1` and must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (either 1 or 3).
   - `n` will be decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 1.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
- If `i` was 3, it will become 4.
- `n` will be `n - 1` and must still be greater than 1.

Since the exact values of `rem`, `k`, and `r` are not specified to change in this iteration, they remain the same.

Therefore, the updated states are:

State: **`rem` is either `k % 3` or 0, `i` is either 2 or 4, `n` is `n - 1` and must still be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is either `a[1]` or `a[i + 1]`.**
