You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}.
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        r = a[0]
        
        rem = 0
        
        y = 0
        
        for i in range(0, n - 1):
            if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
                r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
                rem = k % (i + 1)
                y = n - 1 - i
                k = 0
                break
            else:
                k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
                r = a[i + 1]
        
        if k != 0:
            r = a[n - 1] + k // n
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
        else:
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `ii` is equal to the total number of test cases provided. After all iterations, the variable `n` will be 0 since it is decremented or remains 0 after the loop's conditions are met. The variable `k` will be 0 because it is fully reduced by the loop's operations. The variable `r` will hold the final result calculated based on the last iteration's conditions, which could be `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` is not 0, or simply `a[n - 1]` if `k` is 0. The variable `rem` will be 0 since it is set to `k % (i + 1)` when `k` is reduced to 0. The variable `y` will be 0 because it is only set during the loop and does not change afterward. The list `a` remains sorted and unchanged unless modified within the loop, and the overall postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the loop's execution.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations, `ii` equals the total number of test cases, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `r` is the final calculated result, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `a` remains sorted.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For each test case within `t`, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and `k` is between 0 and 10^12 inclusive. Additionally, it accepts a list `a` containing `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^12 inclusive. The function returns a value based on the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
