Output State: **`rem` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from `k`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `k -= (0 + 1) * (a[0 + 1] - a[0])`, which further simplifies to `k -= (a[1] - a[0])`. Since `rem` is 0 and `i` is 0, their values remain unchanged. The value of `n` must still be greater than 1. Therefore, the updated state includes `k` being reduced by the value of `(a[1] - a[0])`.
