Output State: **`rem` is `k % 3`, `i` is 1, `n` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `rem`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `r`. It only indicates that the execution exits the current loop or conditional block. The value of `k` remains 0 because no operation changes it. The value of `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, which simplifies to `a[1]` since `k` is 0. All other variables retain their initial values, and the break statement is noted.
