Output State: **`rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is `a[0]`, `y` is `n - 2`**

Explanation: The code `k = 0` sets the variable `k` to 0. Given the initial state, `rem` is `k % 1`, which is `0 % 1` and equals 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `n` must still be greater than 1. The value of `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, and since `k` is now 0, `r` simplifies to `a[0]`. The value of `y` is `n - 2` and remains unchanged.
