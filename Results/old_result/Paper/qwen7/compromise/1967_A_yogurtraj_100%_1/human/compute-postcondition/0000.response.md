Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for ii in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `ii`, which is initialized by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We know that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`.
   - This means that `int(input())` will read an integer value from the input, and this value should be within the range `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, the initial state must ensure that the input value falls within the specified range.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state so that the input value (which initializes `ii`) is within the range `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input value must be within this range**.
