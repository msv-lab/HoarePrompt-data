Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be printed:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i = n - 1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
   - `n` remains as the initial value provided.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `k` is either 0 or has been reduced according to the loop conditions.
   - `r` is set to `a[n-1] + k // n`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - The condition `k != 0` is true.

2. **Expression to be Printed**:
   - `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`

Given that `k != 0` and `r = a[n-1] + k // n`, let's substitute these into the expression:

- Since `i = n - 1`, `a[n-1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
- `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

So, `r` is the last element of the list `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `n`.

Now, let's evaluate the expression step by step:

1. Calculate `r - 1`: This is the last element of `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `n` minus 1.
2. Multiply by `n`: This scales the result by `n`.
3. Add 1: This adds 1 to the scaled result.
4. Add `k % n`: This adds the remainder of `k` divided by `n` to the final result.

Since `k` is not zero, `k % n` will be a value between 0 and `n-1`.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \text{Result} = (a[n-1] + \frac{k}{n} - 1) \times n + 1 + k \% n \]

Given that `a[n-1]` is the last element of the list `a`, and `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`, the expression will compute a specific value based on these components.

Output: **(a[n-1] + k//n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n (where a[n-1] is the last element of the list a, and k is an integer such that k != 0)**
