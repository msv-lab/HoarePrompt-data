Output State: **`j` is 0; `arr` is a list containing 26; `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 26**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was initially an input integer greater than or equal to 52, subtracting 26 from it results in an integer that is greater than or equal to 26. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
