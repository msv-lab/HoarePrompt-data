Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:** `m` and `p`
- **For Loop Statement:** 
  ```python
  for i in range(cases):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `cases`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < cases`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` (value of `m` is unchanged)
   - `p` (value of `p` is unchanged)

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the current value of `i`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cases`.

5. **Update the State:**
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `p` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `cases` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion
Since `i` is the only variable that changes within the loop head, and it needs to be incremented for the loop to execute again, the state should reflect this change.

**Final State:**
State: **`m` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `cases` is unchanged**.

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `i` would be 3.

**Final State:**
State: **`m` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `i` is 3, `cases` is unchanged**.
