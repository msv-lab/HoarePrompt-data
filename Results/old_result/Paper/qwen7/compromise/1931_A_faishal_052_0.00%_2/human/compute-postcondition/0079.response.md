Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 2
- `arr` is a list
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains [1] and `lex` is decremented by 1.
- If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` is decremented by 26.

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(2):
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 1`.
- We are currently at the end of the previous iteration, meaning `j` is 2.
- Since the loop runs for `j` in the range `0` to `1`, the loop cannot run anymore because `j` is already 2.

### Conclusion
Since `j` is 2, the loop condition `j in range(2)` is no longer satisfied, and the loop will not execute again.

### Final State
No changes are needed for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition is already not met.

**State: **`j` is 2, `arr` is a list**
