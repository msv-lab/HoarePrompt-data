To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. The print statement is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.
2. We need to know the value of `arr[k]` to proceed.
3. Since the initial state does not explicitly define `arr` or `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `arr[k]` without additional information.

Given this, we can only describe the value of `arr[k]` in terms of its relationship to the character it represents.

Output: **chr(arr[k] + 96) (where arr[k] is an integer and chr(arr[k] + 96) is the corresponding lowercase letter)**
