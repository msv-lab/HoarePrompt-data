Output State: **`lex` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**

Explanation: The initial value of `lex` is an integer. The code `lex = lex - 26` subtracts 26 from the current value of `lex`. Since `lex` was initially an integer, after the subtraction, if the original value of `lex` was exactly 26, then `lex` becomes 0. The list `arr` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
