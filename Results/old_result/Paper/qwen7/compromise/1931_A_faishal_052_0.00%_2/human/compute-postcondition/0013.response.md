Output State: **`j` is 0, `lex` is greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains the value 26**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. The variables `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is still `0`, `lex` is still greater than `26` and greater than or equal to `52`, and `arr` now contains the value `26`.
