Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 0
- `arr` is a list
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element 1 and `lex` is `lex - 1`.
- If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is adjusted to `lex - 26` if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` remains an integer greater than or equal to 26.

### Loop Statement
```
for j in range(2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration. Since the loop runs for 2 iterations, `j` will take values 0 and 1.
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration (i.e., when `j` is 1).

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Initial State**: `j` is 0.
2. **First Iteration**: `j` becomes 1.
3. **Second Iteration**: `j` becomes 2.

Since the loop runs for 2 iterations, we need to consider the state after the first iteration (`j = 1`) to determine the state at the start of the next iteration (`j = 2`).

### State After First Iteration
- `j` is 1.
- The value of `lex` and `arr` could be different based on the conditions given.

### Conditions for `lex` and `arr`
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element 1 and `lex` is `lex - 1`.
- If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is adjusted to `lex - 26` if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` remains an integer greater than or equal to 26.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration (`j = 2`) will depend on the value of `lex` after the first iteration.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `j` is 2.
- The value of `lex` and `arr` will be as determined by the conditions after the first iteration.

Given that `j` is now 2, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `arr` is a list, `lex` is an integer based on the conditions after the first iteration.**

However, since we need to provide a specific state, we can generalize it as follows:

**State: **`j` is 2, `arr` is a list, `lex` is an integer.**

This is because the exact value of `lex` cannot be determined without knowing its initial value and the exact operations performed within the loop body.
