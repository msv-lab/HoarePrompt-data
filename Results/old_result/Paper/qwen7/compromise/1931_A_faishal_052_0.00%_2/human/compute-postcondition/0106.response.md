Output State: **`lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing the element 1**.

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Since `lex` is unchanged and retains its initial state as an integer less than or equal to 26, and no other variables are mentioned, only `arr` is updated.
