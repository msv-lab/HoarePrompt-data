Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element 1 and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is adjusted to `lex - 26` if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` remains an integer greater than or equal to 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains [1] and `lex` is decremented by 1. If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` is decremented by 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2 and `lex` is adjusted by subtracting 26 from its original value. If `lex` is less than 52 after the adjustment, then `arr` contains the element `[26]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
