Output State: **`j` is 2, `arr` is a list containing elements based on the value of `lex` after all iterations.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations (which is 2 iterations in this case), the variable `j` will be 2 since the loop runs in the range of 2. The list `arr` will contain either one or two elements depending on the value of `lex`. If `lex` was initially within the range that allowed it to decrement to a value less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain the element 1. If `lex` was initially greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` will contain the element 26. If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 52, `arr` will contain the element 26 twice, as `lex` will be reduced by 26 each iteration until it falls below 52.
