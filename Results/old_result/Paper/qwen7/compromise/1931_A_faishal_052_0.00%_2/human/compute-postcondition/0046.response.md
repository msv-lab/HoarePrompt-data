Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(3)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has completed its iterations from `k=0` to `k=2`. This means `k` is now at its final value, which is `2`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The condition for the loop to continue is that `k` should be less than `3`. Since `k` is currently `2`, the loop will execute one more time when `k` becomes `3`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to update the state such that `k` is `3` for the next iteration.

Given these steps, the updated state for the next iteration would be:

**State: **`k` is 3**
