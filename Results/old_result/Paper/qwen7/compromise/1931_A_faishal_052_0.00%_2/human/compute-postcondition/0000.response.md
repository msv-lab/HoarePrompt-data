Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, 1 <= `cases` <= 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 78.**

Explanation: The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 remains valid, but since `t` is not mentioned in the code, it is not updated. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, which also remains unchanged. The only change is that `cases` now holds the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
