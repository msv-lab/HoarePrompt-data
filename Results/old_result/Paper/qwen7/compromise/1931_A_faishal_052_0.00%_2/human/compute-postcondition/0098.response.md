Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: 
   - `j` is 2
   - `k` is 2
   - `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements `[lex, ...]`

2. The `arr` list is described as being sorted, but only the first element (`lex`) is explicitly provided. Since the list is sorted, the second element must come after `lex` alphabetically. However, since no other elements are specified, we assume the second element is the next lexicographical element after `lex`, which would be `m` (assuming standard English alphabetical order).

3. Therefore, the list `arr` is `[lex, m, ...]`.

4. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

5. Given `k` is 2, we need to find `arr[2]`. From our assumption, `arr` is `[lex, m, ...]`, so `arr[2]` would be the third element, which is unspecified but follows the pattern.

6. However, the question does not provide enough information about the third element. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the third element is `n` (the next lexicographical element after `m`).

7. Thus, `arr[2] = n`.

8. Now, we need to convert `n` to its corresponding ASCII character using `chr(n + 96)`. In the ASCII table, `n` is the 14th letter, so `n + 96` equals 110. The character corresponding to ASCII 110 is `n`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **n**
