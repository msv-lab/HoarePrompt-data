Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is `lex` - 26, `arr` is [26, 1, 26]**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since the exact initial value of `lex` is not specified (it's only mentioned that it is between 1 and 51), we express the new value of `lex` as `lex - 26`. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
