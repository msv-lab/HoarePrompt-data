Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing `arr`:**
   - The function attempts to construct `arr` based on conditions that do not accurately reflect the encoding process. Specifically, the conditions `if lex <= 26` and `elif lex < 52` are overly simplistic and do not cover all possible scenarios for constructing the smallest word.

2. **Sorting and Printing Logic:**
   - The function sorts the list `arr` after constructing it, which is unnecessary since the goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word directly. Sorting is not the correct approach here.

3. **Incorrect Construction of the Word:**
   - The function appends `lex` to `arr` without considering the actual encoding process. Instead, it should construct the word by determining the appropriate characters based on the sum `lex`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Determine the characters of the word by iterating from the highest possible character (z) downwards until the sum of the characters equals `n`.
- Ensure that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        for i in range(2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(25, -1, -1):
                if n >= j + 1:
                    word += chr(j + 97)
                    n -= j + 1
                    break
        print(word)
```

Explanation:
- We iterate over the positions of the characters from the last (z) to the first (a).
- For each position, we check if the remaining sum `n` is greater than or equal to the current character's position.
- If so, we append the character to the word and subtract its position from `n`.
- This ensures that we always use the smallest possible characters first, making the word lexicographically smallest.

Given this corrected logic, the original function is incorrect. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
