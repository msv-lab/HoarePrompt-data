Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`, which represents the encoded value.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the value `lex` into a three-letter word.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed and does not correctly handle the decoding process. Specifically:
     - The program tries to append values to `arr` without considering the actual constraints of the problem.
     - It incorrectly handles the decrement of `lex` and the assignment of values to `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - After constructing `arr`, the program sorts it.
   - It then prints the sorted values as characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's take the example test case `24` and see how the program processes it:

- Input: `24`
- Initial `arr` is empty.
- The loop runs twice (since `j` ranges from 0 to 1):
  - First iteration: `lex = 24`. Since `lex > 26`, it appends `26` to `arr` and sets `lex = 24 - 26 = -2` (which is invalid).
  - Second iteration: `lex = -2` (invalid).

Thus, the array `arr` ends up with invalid values, and the sorting and printing steps will produce incorrect results.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly decode the encoded value, we need to:
1. Determine the largest possible letter that can fit within the remaining value.
2. Subtract the value of that letter from the total.
3. Repeat until the value is fully decoded.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        result = []
        for j in range(3):
            if lex >= 26:
                result.append(26)
                lex -= 26
            else:
                result.append(lex)
                lex = 0
        result.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(result[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to flawed logic in handling the decoding process. Therefore, the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
