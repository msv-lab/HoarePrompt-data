### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array `a` of length `n` after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The key insight is that each operation can potentially double the sum of the array if we strategically choose the subarray whose sum is maximized.
   - After `k` operations, the sum of the array can be maximized by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum to the array.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code attempts to find the maximum subarray sum using a simple iteration over the array elements.
   - It maintains a running sum `c` and updates `maxi` with the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.
   - This approach is flawed because it only considers the maximum subarray sum once, rather than considering the effect of multiple operations.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we should consider the sum of the entire array after `k` operations.
   - Each operation can add the sum of the entire array to the array, effectively doubling the sum.
   - Therefore, the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is \((2^k \times \text{sum}(l) - \text{sum}(l) + \text{sum}(l)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which simplifies to \((2^k \times \text{sum}(l)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

5. **Code Evaluation**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the above logic.
   - It uses a flawed method to find the maximum subarray sum and incorrectly applies the operations.
   - The formula used in the code is incorrect and does not reflect the true maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. The given solution does not account for the proper application of the operations and the correct formula to compute the maximum sum.

**Correctness: False**
