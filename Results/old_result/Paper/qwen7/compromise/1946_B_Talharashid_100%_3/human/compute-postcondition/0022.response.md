Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in l`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the current state**: 
   - `l` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `ele` is the second element of `l`.
   - `c` is either the sum of `c` and the second element of `l`, or `c` is 0.
   - `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the second element of `l`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `ele` is the second element of `l`, it means the loop has processed the second element already.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` should be the third element of `l`.
   - `c` will be updated based on the third element of `l` (either `c + third_element` or `0` if `c` was 0).
   - `maxi` will be updated to be the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `l` remains the same as it is the list being iterated over.
   - `ele` changes to the third element of `l`.
   - `c` is updated to include the third element of `l`.
   - `maxi` is updated to reflect the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the third element of `l`, `c` is either the sum of `c` and the third element of `l`, or `c` is 0, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`**.
