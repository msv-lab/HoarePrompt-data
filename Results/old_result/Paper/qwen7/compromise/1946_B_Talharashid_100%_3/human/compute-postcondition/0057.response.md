Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated by adding the next element in the list `l` to its current value, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by the next element in the list `l` (denoted as `ele`). The other variables (`maxi`, `n`, `k`, and `ele`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
