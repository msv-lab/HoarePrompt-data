Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum value encountered during the iterations, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the second input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `maxi` will hold the maximum value of `c` (which is reset to 0 whenever a negative element with an absolute value greater than or equal to `c` is encountered) or `c + ele` (when `ele` is non-negative). The variable `c` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, and the list `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variables `i`, `n`, and `k` also remain unchanged as they are not involved in the loop's logic.
