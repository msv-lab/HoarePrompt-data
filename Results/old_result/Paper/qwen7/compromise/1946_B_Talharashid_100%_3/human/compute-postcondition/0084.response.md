Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `ele`, and it iterates over the list `l`.

2. **Understand the loop body**: The loop updates the state based on the current value of `ele` and another variable `c`. Specifically:
   - If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0.
   - Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + 2 * ele`.
   - `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c + ele` and 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0.
   - If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is updated to 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + 2 * ele`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, `ele` will take the next element from the list `l`.
   - The state of `maxi` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because `maxi` is only updated within the loop and not reset.
   - `c` will be updated based on the new `ele` according to the rules mentioned above.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `maxi` remains unchanged.
   - `c` will be updated based on the next `ele` in the list `l`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0.
- `c` is updated based on the previous `ele`.

For the next iteration, the state should reflect the initial conditions of `maxi` and the updated `c` before the loop starts again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0, `c` is updated based on the next `ele` in the list `l` (initially 0 if no update has occurred)**.

To provide a concrete example, let's assume the previous `ele` was `-5` and `c` was `10`:
- `maxi` would be the maximum of `10 + (-5)` and 0, which is 5.
- For the next iteration, `c` will be updated based on the next `ele`.

If the next `ele` is `3`:
- `c` will be updated to `10 + 2 * 3 = 16`.
- `maxi` remains 5.

So, the final state would be:
State: **`maxi` is 5, `c` is 16**.

However, since the exact values of `maxi` and `c` depend on the specific values of the elements in the list `l`, the general form of the answer is:
State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0, `c` is updated based on the next `ele` in the list `l`**.
