Output State: **`c` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `k` is the second integer entered, both integers are at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `maxi` is 0.**

The code initializes `maxi` to 0. This does not affect the values of `c`, `n`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `maxi` is set to 0.
