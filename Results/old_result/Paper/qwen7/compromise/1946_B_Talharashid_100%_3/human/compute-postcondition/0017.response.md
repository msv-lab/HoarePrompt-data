Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the second element of `l`, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the current `maxi`.**

The code initializes `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `l`, `ele`, or `maxi`. The value of `maxi` remains the maximum of `c` (which is now 0) and its previous value.
