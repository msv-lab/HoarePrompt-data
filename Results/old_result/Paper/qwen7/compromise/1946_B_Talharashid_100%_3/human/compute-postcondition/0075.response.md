Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is `c + ele`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `ele` is the first element of `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` remains 0 and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`, and `c` is updated to `c + ele`.
