Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code sets `c` to 0, which overrides the previous value of `c` (which was updated based on `ele`). The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, but since `c` is now 0, `maxi` remains unchanged if `maxi` was already greater than or equal to 0. All other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.
