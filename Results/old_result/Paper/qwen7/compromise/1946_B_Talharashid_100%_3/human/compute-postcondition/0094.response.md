Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`. Given `c` is 0, `maxi` will be 0 if it was initially 0 or greater, and will remain unchanged if it was already greater than 0.
   - `i` is the first input integer.
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `k` is the second input integer.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the second input string and converting each element to an integer.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `maxi` is 0 because `c` is 0.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the second input string. Let's denote this list as `l = [l1, l2, ..., ln]`.

Now, let's substitute these values into the expression inside the `print` statement:
- `2 ** k * maxi` becomes `2 ** k * 0` which is 0.
- `- maxi` becomes `-0` which is 0.
- `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

So the expression simplifies to:
\[ 0 - 0 + \text{sum}(l) \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ \text{sum}(l) \mod 1000000007 \]

Therefore, the output will be the sum of all elements in the list `l` modulo \(1000000007\).

Output: **sum(l) % 1000000007 (where sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l obtained from the second input string)**
