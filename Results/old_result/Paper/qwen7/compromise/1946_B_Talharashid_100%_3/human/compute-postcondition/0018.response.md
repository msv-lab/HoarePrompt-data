Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the second element of `l`, `c` is the sum of `c` and the second element of `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`, which is the second element of the list `l`. The initial state of `l` being a non-empty list of integers and `ele` being the second element of `l` remains unchanged. The only change is that `c` now holds the value of its previous value plus `ele`.
