Output State: **`n` is the first integer entered, `k` is the second integer entered, both integers are at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
