Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers, and two positive integers `n` and `k` as parameters. The length of the list `a` is `n`, and each element in the list satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive, and the sum of all `n` and `k` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Note: The specific return value is not detailed here as the problem statement only provides the conditions but not the exact output for those conditions.
