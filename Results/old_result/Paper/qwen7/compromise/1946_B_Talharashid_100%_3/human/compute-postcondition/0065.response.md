Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is the last value it was updated to, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the second input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `l`. The values of `maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
