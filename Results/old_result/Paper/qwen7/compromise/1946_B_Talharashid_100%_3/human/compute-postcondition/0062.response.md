Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`. Since `c` is the last value `maxi` was updated to and initially `l` is an empty list, we need to consider the initial value of `maxi` which is not explicitly given but is derived from `c`.
   - `i` is the length of the list `l`, which is 0 since `l` is empty.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `c` is the last value `maxi` was updated to, and since `l` is empty, `c` is also not explicitly given but is derived from `maxi`.
   - `l` is an empty list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, but since `c` and `maxi` are not explicitly given, we assume `maxi` is the initial value it holds, which is not specified. For simplicity, let's assume `maxi` is initialized to 0 (since no other value is provided).
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is an empty list, so `sum(l)` is 0.

Substituting these into the expression:
```python
(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007
```
becomes:
```python
(2 ** k * 0 - 0 + 0) % 1000000007
```
which simplifies to:
```python
0 % 1000000007
```
and the result is:
```python
0
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **0**
