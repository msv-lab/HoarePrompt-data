Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `0`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated based on the condition of `ele`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `0` and `c`. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
