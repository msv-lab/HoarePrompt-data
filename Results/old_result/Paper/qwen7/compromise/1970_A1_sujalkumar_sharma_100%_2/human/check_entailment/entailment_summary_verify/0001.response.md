Reasoning:
1. The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the input.
2. It calculates the prefix balance for each character in the sequence and stores the balance, position, and character in a list `prefix_balance`.
3. The list `prefix_balance` is sorted based on the prefix balance in ascending order. In case of a tie, it sorts by position in descending order.
4. After sorting, it constructs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence by concatenating the characters in the sorted list.
5. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Let's verify the correctness of the implementation step-by-step:

- **Step 1**: Reading the input string `s` is handled correctly by `s = input().strip()`.
- **Step 2**: Calculating the prefix balance for each character and storing it in `prefix_balance` is done correctly. The balance is updated as expected, and the tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` is appended to the list.
- **Step 3**: Sorting the `prefix_balance` list based on the prefix balance in ascending order and by position in descending order is done using `prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))`. This ensures that the sequence is sorted according to the rules specified.
- **Step 4**: Constructing the resulting balanced shuffle sequence by concatenating the characters in the sorted list is done correctly with `result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])`.

The function `func_1` indeed implements the logic described in the problem statement accurately. There are no apparent issues or errors in the code that would cause it to produce incorrect results.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
