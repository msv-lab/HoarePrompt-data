#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the current balance value, the index `i`, and the character `s[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string 'result' which contains the characters from 's' based on the sorted 'prefix_balance' list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" characters, representing a balanced parentheses sequence. It calculates the balance of parentheses up to each position in the string, stores this information along with the index and character in a list, sorts this list based on balance and index, and finally constructs and returns a new string containing the characters from `s` in the order specified by the sorted list.
