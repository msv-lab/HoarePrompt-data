Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not process it. Instead, it reads a single value for `n` and processes it as if it were the number of test cases. This leads to incorrect behavior for multi-test case inputs.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1
2 3
2
1 1 2 1
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The program will incorrectly process this as a single test case with `n = 3`, leading to the following incorrect output:
```
6
```

Instead of processing each test case separately, the program should iterate over the number of test cases `t` and handle each test case individually. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[index:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        
        nums.sort()
        score = sum(nums[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases and calculates the maximum final score for each test case as described in the problem statement.
