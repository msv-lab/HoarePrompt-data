You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers written on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: The final value of `s` is the sum of all integers in `list2` at even indices from all iterations combined, `i` is equal to the total length of `list2` across all iterations, `final` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `s` from each iteration, and `list2` is a sorted list of integers from all iterations combined with a length that is the sum of the lengths of `list2` from each iteration.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: final must contain the cumulative sum of s from each iteration, and list2 must contain a sorted list of integers from all iterations combined with a length that is the sum of the lengths of list2 from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer \( n \) and an array of \( 2n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of integers at even indices in the sorted array of these integers, then appends this sum to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the cumulative sums for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `n` from the first input line.
   - It then enters a loop where it reads an integer `s`, which seems unnecessary and does not affect the logic.
   - Next, it reads a string `a` and then a list of strings `b`. This list `b` is split into integers and stored in `list2`.

2. **Sorting and Scoring:**
   - The list `list2` is sorted.
   - A variable `s` is initialized to 0.
   - The program then iterates over every two elements in the sorted list, adding the first element (which is the smaller one) to `s`.
   - Finally, the score `s` is appended to the list `final`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints each score in the `final` list.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Unnecessary Variables:**
   - The variables `s` and `list2` inside the loop are not needed. The score can be calculated directly without these intermediate steps.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program reads an unnecessary integer `s` and a string `a` before reading the list of integers. These should be removed.
   - The sorting and scoring logic is correct but can be simplified.

3. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The program should handle multiple test cases correctly. It should read the number of test cases `t` and process each test case separately.

4. **Input Format:**
   - The program assumes that the input format is consistent with the problem statement. However, it does not handle multiple test cases properly.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[index:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        
        nums.sort()
        score = sum(nums[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has several issues that need to be addressed. After correcting these issues, the program should work as expected. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
