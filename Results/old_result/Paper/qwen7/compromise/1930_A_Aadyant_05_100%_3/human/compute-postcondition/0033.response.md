Output State: **`s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `i` is equal to the last even index processed which is `len(list2) - 1`, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`, `num` is 1, `list1` is a list of words from `b`.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of words based on whitespace and assigns it to `list1`. The other variables remain unchanged. `s` remains 0, `list2` remains an empty list, `a` remains the new input string, `b` remains the new input string, `i` remains equal to the last even index processed which is `len(list2) - 1`, `final` remains a list containing the value of `s`, and `num` remains 1.
