Output State: **`list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word; `list2` contains an element which is the integer representation of the current word in `list1`, and `list2` has appended an integer representation of `str`.**

This means that the `str` variable, which presumably holds a string that represents a number, has been converted to an integer and added to `list2`. The contents of `list1` remain unchanged, and `list2` now includes the newly appended integer.
