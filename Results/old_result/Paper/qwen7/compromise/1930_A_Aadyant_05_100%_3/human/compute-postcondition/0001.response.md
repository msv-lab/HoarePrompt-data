Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `final` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `final`. This does not change the values of `t` or `n`, nor does it assign any new values to them. Therefore, they retain their initial conditions. The only new variable introduced is `final`, which is set to an empty list.
