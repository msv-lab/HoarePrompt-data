Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer \( n \) and an array of \( 2n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of integers at even indices in the sorted array of these integers, then appends this sum to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the cumulative sums for each test case.**
