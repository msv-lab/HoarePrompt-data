Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `s` is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of `list2[2]`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over indices starting from 0 up to but not including `len(list2)`, with a step of 2.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 (the step size). Therefore, `i` will become 4.
4. **Condition Check**: The loop will continue if `i < len(list2)`. Since `i` is now 4, the condition will depend on the length of `list2`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **Variable `i`**: It needs to be set to 4.
- **Variable `list2`**: We need to ensure that the length of `list2` is such that the loop can still execute. Since `i` is 4, `len(list2)` must be greater than 4.

### Final State:
- `i` is 4
- `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (since the loop body is omitted, no changes are made to `s`)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of `list2[2]`**
