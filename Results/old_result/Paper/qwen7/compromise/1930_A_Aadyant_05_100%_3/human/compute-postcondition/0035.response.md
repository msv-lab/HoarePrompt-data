Output State: **`list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word; `list2` contains an element which is the integer representation of `str`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `list2.append(int(str))` appends the integer representation of the string `str` to the list `list2`. Since `str` is a string, `int(str)` attempts to convert `str` into an integer. However, without knowing the actual content of `str`, we cannot determine the exact integer value. The precondition that `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word remains unchanged.
