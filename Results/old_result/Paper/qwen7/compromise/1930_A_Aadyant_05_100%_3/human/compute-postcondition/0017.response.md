Output State: **`s` is 0, `list2` is a sorted list of integers corresponding to the words in `list1`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string that must contain at least one space-separated word.**

Explanation: The code `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. Since `s` was never modified within the loop, its value remains 0. The exact contents of `list2` are the integers corresponding to the words in `list1`, now sorted. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
