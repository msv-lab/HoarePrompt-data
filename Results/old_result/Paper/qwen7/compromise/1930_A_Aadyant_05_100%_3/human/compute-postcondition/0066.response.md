Output State: `s` is 0, `list2` is a list of integers, `list1` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `list1` will be empty because each iteration removes one element from `list1`. The variable `s` remains unchanged at 0. `list2` will contain integers converted from all the words in `list1` after each iteration, resulting in a list of integers with a length equal to the original number of elements in `list1`.
