Output State: **`list1` is a list of words from `b` that must contain at least one word; `list2` is a list containing the integer representations of all words in `list1`, and `list2` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. Since `list2` contains the integer representations of the words in `list1`, sorting `list2` rearranges its elements based on their numerical values. The initial conditions about `list1` and `list2` remain true, but now `list2` is sorted.
