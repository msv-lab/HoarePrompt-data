Output State: **`i` is 4; `s` is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of `list2[2]` + the integer value of `list2[4]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding the integer value of `list2[i]` to `s`. Given that `i` is 4, `s` is updated to its original value plus the integer value of `list2[4]`. The original value of `list2[2]` was added to `s` before this line of code, so it remains part of the updated value of `s`.
