Output State: **`set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `A` is False, and `not_c` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `A` was originally either `True` or `False`. After executing `A = not A`, if `A` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and if `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`. However, since the initial state specifies `A` is either `True` or `False`, after the operation, `A` will be the opposite of its original value. Given `not_c` is initially `True`, its value remains unchanged. The list `set_` is also unaffected by this operation.
