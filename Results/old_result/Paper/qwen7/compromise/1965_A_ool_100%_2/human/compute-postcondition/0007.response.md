Output State: **`set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `A` is False, and `not_c` is True.**

Explanation: The line `not_c = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `not_c`. This does not affect the values of `set_` or `A`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `not_c` being updated to `True`.
