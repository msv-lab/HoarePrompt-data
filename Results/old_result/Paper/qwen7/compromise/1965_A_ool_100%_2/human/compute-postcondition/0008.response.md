Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the range is specified as `range(1, len(set_))`).
3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`.

Given the initial state:
- `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order.
- `A` is `False`.
- `not_c` is `True`.

The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`, and its initial value should be set to 1. The length of `set_` (`len(set_)`) determines how many times the loop will run.

Since the loop will start with `i` being 1, we don't need to change the state of `set_` itself, but we need to ensure that `i` is correctly initialized to 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` is 1.

The final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is 1**
