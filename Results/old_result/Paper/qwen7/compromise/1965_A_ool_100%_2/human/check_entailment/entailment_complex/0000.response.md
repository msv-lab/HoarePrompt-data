Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem describes a game where players take turns removing a fixed number of stones from each non-empty pile until no moves can be made. The goal is to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of stone piles, assuming optimal play.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the list `arr` to determine the winner.
   - It first removes duplicates and sorts the list.
   - If the smallest value is not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'.
   - Otherwise, it checks for gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements.
   - The boolean `A` alternates with each iteration, and the final decision is based on its state.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - If the smallest value is not 1, 'Alice' wins because she can reduce the smallest pile to 1, forcing Bob into a losing position.
   - If the smallest value is 1, the game's outcome depends on whether there are gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements:
     - If there are no gaps (consecutive elements), the game is equivalent to the Nim game where the XOR of all pile sizes determines the winner.
     - If there are gaps, the game's outcome is more complex but can still be analyzed using similar principles.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the smallest value is not 1, returning 'Alice'.
   - For the case where the smallest value is 1, the function's logic seems to be flawed. It incorrectly returns 'Alice' or 'Bob' without properly evaluating the game state based on the Nim-sum or other game theory principles.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the example provided, the function returns incorrect results for some cases, indicating a flaw in the logic.

Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the game logic for the case where the smallest value is 1. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
