Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and t pairs of integers. For each pair, it reads an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list of integers in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest numbers for each pair. After processing all test cases, it outputs the sums of the two largest numbers for each input list.**
