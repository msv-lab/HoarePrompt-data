You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now equal to the value it was initialized to. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer read from input, and nums is a list of integers sorted in descending order. The output for each iteration is the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list, printed to the console. After all iterations, the value of t remains unchanged, but the outputs consist of the sums of the two largest numbers from each input list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of sub-cases, followed by t pairs of integers. For each pair, the first integer n (2 <= n <= 100) represents the count of subsequent integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function returns results based on the processing of these test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
