Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of all integers in list `a`, and n is a positive integer, and a is a list of n integers where each integer represents the amount of water in the corresponding container. The sum of all integers in the list is divisible by n.**

Explanation: The code calculates the total amount of water by summing up all the integers in the list `a`. This sum is stored in the variable `total_water`. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer and that the sum of all integers in the list `a` is divisible by `n` remains unchanged.
