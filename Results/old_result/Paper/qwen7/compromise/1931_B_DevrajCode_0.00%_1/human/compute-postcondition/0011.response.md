Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` integers representing the amount of water in each of `n` containers. It calculates the average amount of water per container and checks if redistributing the water according to this average would result in any container having less than zero water. If any container ends up with less than zero water during the redistribution process, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function returns 'No' in Case_1 and 'Yes' in Case_2.**
