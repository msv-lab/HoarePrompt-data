Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases where each test case has a fixed structure.

2. **Extracting Test Case Information:**
   - The first element of `data` is converted to an integer `n`, representing the number of containers.
   - The subsequent elements are converted to integers and stored in the list `a`, representing the amounts of water in each container.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes two parameters: `n` (number of containers) and `a` (list of water amounts).
   - It calculates the total amount of water using `sum(a)`.
   - It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns `'No'`.
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list `a` and keeps track of the difference between the current water amount and the target amount in the variable `container`.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water, and the function returns `'No'`.
   - If the loop completes without returning `'No'`, it means it's possible to balance the water, and the function returns `'Yes'`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to check if the logic correctly determines whether it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

1. **Divisibility Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns `'No'`, which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly if the total is not divisible by `n`.

2. **Balancing Check:**
   - The program attempts to balance the water by ensuring that the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount never goes negative. This is a valid approach because if the cumulative difference ever goes negative, it means there isn't enough water in the later containers to balance out the excess in the earlier containers.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
