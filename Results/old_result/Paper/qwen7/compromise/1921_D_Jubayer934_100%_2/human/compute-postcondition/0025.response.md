Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `temp` is 0, `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs `n` times (from `i=0` to `i=n-1`). The variable `temp` remains 0 as no `break` statement was encountered during the loop's execution based on the given information. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` holds true for each iteration of the loop.
