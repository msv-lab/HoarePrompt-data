Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` equals `n`, `temp` equals `n`, `b` is the same list `ans`, and `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them based on space, converting them into integers and assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The other variables (`i`, `temp`, `b`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
