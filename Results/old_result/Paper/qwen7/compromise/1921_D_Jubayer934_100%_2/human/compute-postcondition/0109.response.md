Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
  - The other variables retain their original states.

- The for loop statement:
  ```python
  for i in range(temp, n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop head `for i in range(temp, n):` involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `[temp, n)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value within this range.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The new value of `i` must still be within the range `[temp, n)` for the loop to continue.

### New State Calculation:
- Let's assume the previous value of `i` was `i_prev`.
- The new value of `i` will be `i_new = i_prev + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `i_new` must be less than `n` and greater than or equal to `temp`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_prev = 5`.
- The new value of `i` will be `i_new = 5 + 1 = 6`.
- For the loop to continue, `6` must be within the range `[temp, n)`.
- Therefore, `temp <= 6 < n`.

### Final State:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
- The other variables (`ans`, `a`, `b`, `temp`, `n`) retain their original states.

### Answer:
State: **`ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and the other variables retain their original states.**

If we know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can specify it explicitly. For example, if `i_prev` was 5, then:

State: **`ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[6]` and `b[-(n - 6)]`, `i` is 6, and the other variables retain their original states.**
