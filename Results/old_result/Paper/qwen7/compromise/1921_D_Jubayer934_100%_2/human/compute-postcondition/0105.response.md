Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `temp`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `temp`.
   - The variable `temp` must be a valid starting point for the loop, meaning it should be less than or equal to `n-1` (since `range(temp, n)` will iterate from `temp` to `n-1`).

3. **Check the given postconditions**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`: This condition is not relevant for the initial state before the loop starts. It is a condition after the loop has completed.
   - `n` is greater than 0: This is a necessary condition for the loop to execute.
   - `a` is a list of integers: This is not directly related to the loop head, so no adjustment is needed here.
   - `b` is a list of integers: This is not directly related to the loop head, so no adjustment is needed here.
   - `ans` is a list containing the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`: This is not directly related to the loop head, so no adjustment is needed here.
   - `temp` is not equal to -1 because it has been updated beyond its initial assignment: This is a condition after the loop has completed, not before.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = temp`, `i` must be set to `temp`.
   - `temp` must be a valid starting point, meaning it should be less than or equal to `n-1`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to `temp` and `temp` must be less than or equal to `n-1`.

**State:**
**`i` is `temp`, `temp` must be less than or equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
