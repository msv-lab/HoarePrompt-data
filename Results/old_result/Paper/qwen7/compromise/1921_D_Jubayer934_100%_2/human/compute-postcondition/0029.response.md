Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 0, `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[0] - b[n]) <= abs(a[0] - b[0])`, and the current value of `temp` is not -1**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is 0) and `b[-(n - i)]` (which is `b[n]` since `i` is 0) to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 0, the condition `abs(a[0] - b[n]) <= abs(a[0] - b[0])` simplifies to checking if `abs(a[0] - b[n]) <= abs(a[0] - b[0])`. This value is then added to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
