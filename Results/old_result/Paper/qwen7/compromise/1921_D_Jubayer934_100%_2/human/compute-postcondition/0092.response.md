Output State: **`i` is equal to `temp + 1`, `temp` is equal to `i`, `n` must be greater than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `temp`, or `n`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of `i` and `temp` remain as they were (`i` is equal to `temp + 1` and `temp` is equal to `i`). The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
