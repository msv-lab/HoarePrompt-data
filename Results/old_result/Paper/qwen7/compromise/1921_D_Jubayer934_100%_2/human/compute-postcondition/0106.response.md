Output State: **`ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, and the other variables retain their original states.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between the elements `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical value of the appended element. However, we know that `ans` now contains one more element, which is the absolute difference as described.
