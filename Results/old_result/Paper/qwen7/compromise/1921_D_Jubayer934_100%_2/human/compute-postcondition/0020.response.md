Output State: **`i` is 2; `temp` is 2; `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `temp = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 2, to `temp`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `ans` remains the same, containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` appended to it. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
