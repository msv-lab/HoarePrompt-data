Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the variables `i` and `n` are the ones that need to be considered for adjustment.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (as per the `range(n)` syntax).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `n` is the first integer entered by the user, it must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

4. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above points, the initial state of `i` should be set to 0, and `n` should be set to the value entered by the user, ensuring it is within the valid range.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` should be the value entered by the user, ensuring it is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user and must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100**.
