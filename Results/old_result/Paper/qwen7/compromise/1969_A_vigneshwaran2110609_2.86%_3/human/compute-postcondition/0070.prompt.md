Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 11, `x` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 10, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map(int, input().strip().split()), `flag` is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` must be at least 12, and after the execution of the if-else block, if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is true, then the first element of list `l` is equal to 0 and the second element of list `l` is also equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, no changes occur to the elements of list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` must be at least 12, and the elements of list `l` remain unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the elements of list `l` remain unchanged and no changes are made to `flag`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` must be at least 12, and if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
