Output State: **`T` is `x`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial value of `T` is `x`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, `T` is still `x`, while `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values of the input integers.
