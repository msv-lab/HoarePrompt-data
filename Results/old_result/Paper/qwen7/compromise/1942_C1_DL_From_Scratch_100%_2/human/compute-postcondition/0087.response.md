Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `x-2`
- `x` is an input integer
- `count` is incremented by 1 (though the value of `count` is not explicitly stated, it doesn't affect the output of the print statement directly)
- `num` equals 1 (though `num` is not used in the print statement, it is mentioned for completeness)

The print statement is:
```python
print(count + x - 2)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i = x - 2`
- Therefore, `x - 2` is the value of `i`.

However, the print statement involves `count + x - 2`. Since `count` is incremented by 1 but its initial value is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. But we do know that `x - 2` is part of the expression.

Given the information, the print statement will output the value of `count` plus `x - 2`.

Output: **count + x - 2 (where count is incremented by 1 and x is an input integer)**
