Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \), then it is not beneficial to apply any promotion, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). The profit would be \( n \times a \).

2. **Case 2:** If \( b - a < n \), then Bob can sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices from \( b \) to \( b - (b - a) \), and the remaining \( n - (b - a + 1) \) buns at the usual price \( a \). The total profit in this case is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{b-a+1} (b-i+1) + a \times (n - (b-a+1))
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \frac{(2b - (b - a) + 1)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a + 1))
   \]

3. **Case 3:** If \( b - a \geq n \), then Bob can sell all buns at the modified prices from \( b \) to \( b - (n-1) \). The total profit in this case is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (b - i + 1) = \frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2}
   \]

The provided code correctly handles these three cases and calculates the maximum profit accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.
