### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are correctly initialized from the input for each test case. This is correct.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - **Case 1 (`b <= a`)**: The program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a` when the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price. This is correct because selling all buns at the usual price would yield the highest profit.
   - **Case 2 (`b - a >= n`)**: The program correctly calculates the profit using the formula \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\). This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n-1)`.
   - **Case 3 (`b - a < n`)**: The program correctly calculates the profit using the formula \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\). This formula accounts for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is correct.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit for each test case based on the conditions provided.

### Correctness:
**True**
