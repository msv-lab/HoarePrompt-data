The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes input through a loop or external source since it mentions handling multiple test cases. It processes each test case consisting of three positive integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of buns, `a` is the usual price of a bun, and `b` is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned, but it seems to calculate and possibly print or return the total cost based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three positive integers (n, a, b), calculates the total cost of buns based on the given prices, and returns the total cost for each test case.**
