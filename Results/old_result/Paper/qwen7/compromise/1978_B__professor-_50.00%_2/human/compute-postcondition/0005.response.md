Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers (n, a, b). It calculates the total cost of buns based on the given prices and prints the total cost for each test case. Depending on the relationship between `a` and `b`, it uses different formulas to compute the total cost. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it simply prints `n * a`. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\). Otherwise, it prints \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\). After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value, only printing the results.**
