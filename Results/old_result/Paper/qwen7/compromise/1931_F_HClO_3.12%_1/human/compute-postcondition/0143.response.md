Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer.
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after the first two integers have been processed.
   - If `l3` is not equal to a list of integers excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for (a3, l3) in val:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over pairs `(a3, l3)` from the iterable `val`.
   - For each iteration, `a3` and `l3` are updated based on the current pair from `val`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop head involves `a3` and `l3`, these are the only variables that can be adjusted.
   - The value of `m` is not directly controlled by the loop and remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not provided here.

Given that the loop is iterating over pairs `(a3, l3)`, the next iteration will provide a new pair `(a3, l3)` from `val`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `m` remains greater than 1 as it is not controlled by the loop head.
- `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the next pair from `val`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the next integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after processing the first two integers.**

To represent this in the required format:
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the next integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after processing the first two integers.**
