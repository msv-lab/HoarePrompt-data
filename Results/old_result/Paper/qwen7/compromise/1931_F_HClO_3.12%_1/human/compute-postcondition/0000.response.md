Output State: **`t` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer, and the code only changes the value of `t` to an input integer, the output state is that `t` is now the input integer. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
