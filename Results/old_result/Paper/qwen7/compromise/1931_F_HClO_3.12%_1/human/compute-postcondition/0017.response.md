Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and the input has been accepted but not stored.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 (since `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

**State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
