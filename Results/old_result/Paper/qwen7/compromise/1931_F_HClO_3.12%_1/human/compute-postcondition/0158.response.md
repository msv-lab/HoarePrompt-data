Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list containing all integers except the first one from the input excluding `a2`, `m` is `n`, `a3` is the last integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is an empty list, `val` is an empty list, `t` is 1, `a2` is the second integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing all integers except the first and second one from the input.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`. Since `l1` originally contains all integers except the first one from the input, and now excludes `a2`, `l11` will contain all integers from `l1` except `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
