Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3, input is taken but not stored.**

The code `input()` takes user input but does not store it in any variable. Therefore, the precondition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 remains unchanged. The input itself is not stored or assigned to any variable, so no new variables are introduced or modified.
