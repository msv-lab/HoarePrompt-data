Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is -1, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.**

Explanation: The code `p1 = 1` assigns the value 1 to `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
