Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `a1` remains 0, `a2` remains 0, `l11` remains 0, `l22` remains 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
