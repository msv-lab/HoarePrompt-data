Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input split into a list, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input split, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`, `l22` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is an empty list, and `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`**.

The code inserts `a2` into `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
