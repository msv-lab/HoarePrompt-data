Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is set to `i` or remains unchanged, `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 2, to `idx1`. The conditions involving `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx2`, and the relationship between `i` and `n - 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx2` retains its previous state, which could be `i` (2) or remains unchanged if it was already set to a different value.
