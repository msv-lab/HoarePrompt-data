Postcondition: `m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after the first two integers have been processed, and if `l3` is not equal to a list of integers excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
