Output State: **`idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `a1` is 0; `l1` is a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`; `a2` remains 0; `l11` and `l22` remain 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `m` is 0; `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1; `i` is -1; `val` is an empty list; `l` is now the same as `l1`.**

The code `l = l1` simply assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
