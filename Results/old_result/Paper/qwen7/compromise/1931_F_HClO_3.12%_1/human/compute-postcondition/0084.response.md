Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
