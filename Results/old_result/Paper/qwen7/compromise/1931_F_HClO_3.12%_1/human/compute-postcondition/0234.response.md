Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `i`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; `idx2` is now 2 if the if condition is not met. After executing the if-else block, if the condition `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
