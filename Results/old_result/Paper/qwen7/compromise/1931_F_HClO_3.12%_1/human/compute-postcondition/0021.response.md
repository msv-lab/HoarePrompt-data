Output State: `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, input is taken but not stored for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `m` must be at least 3, and there will have been `m-2` inputs taken during the loop's execution, though these inputs are not stored.
