Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-2`
- `n` is greater than 1
- The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`
- Either `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `n-3`
- `p2` is 1
- Both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative
- The list `val` is created but is empty
- `idx2` is `n-3`
- `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`
- `m` equals 2

The print statement is simply `print('yes')`.

Since the print statement is directly printing the string `'yes'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **yes**
