Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0, meaning `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust States**: We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute. All other variables listed in the initial state do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

Given the above analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `m` is greater than 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be greater than 2**
