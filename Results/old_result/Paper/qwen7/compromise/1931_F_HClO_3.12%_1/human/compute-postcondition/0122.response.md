Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `a3` is an integer from the input and `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` now contains one tuple with these values. The conditions and initial states of `m` and `a3` remain unchanged.
