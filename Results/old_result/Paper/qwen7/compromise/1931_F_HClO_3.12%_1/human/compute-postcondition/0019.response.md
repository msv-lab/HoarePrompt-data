Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `m` in the expression `range(m - 2)`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `m - 2` is a positive integer, meaning `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still satisfy the condition `m - 2 > 0`, which means `m` must be greater than 2. Since `m` was greater than or equal to 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
