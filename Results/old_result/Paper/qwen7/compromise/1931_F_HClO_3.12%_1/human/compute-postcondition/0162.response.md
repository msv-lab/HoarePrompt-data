Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(m - 2):`. Here, `_` is a placeholder variable, and `m` is the variable that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, no variable has been assigned a value. This means that `m` has not been set to any specific value yet.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `_` is a placeholder and does not hold any meaningful state, the only variable that needs adjustment is `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `m` must be greater than 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 2**
