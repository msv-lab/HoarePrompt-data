Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the next integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after processing the first two integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `m`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in.
