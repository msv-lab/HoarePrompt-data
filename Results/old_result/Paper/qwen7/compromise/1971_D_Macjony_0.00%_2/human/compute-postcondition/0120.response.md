Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 3, `s` is the new input string, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `j` is 8.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` is 7, so after executing the code, `j` becomes 8. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`) remain unchanged.
