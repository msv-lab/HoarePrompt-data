Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with its length greater than 3, `count` is either 2 or remains 1, `flag` is True if the current value of `s[j]` is '0' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False, `j` is 1 if the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` is met and `flag` is set to True, otherwise `j` remains 0.
