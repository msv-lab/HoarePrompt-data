Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) and a binary string \( s \). For each test case, it calculates the number of segments in the binary string \( s \) where consecutive characters differ, adjusting the count if the sequence '01' is found. The function prints the final count for each test case and does not return any value.**
