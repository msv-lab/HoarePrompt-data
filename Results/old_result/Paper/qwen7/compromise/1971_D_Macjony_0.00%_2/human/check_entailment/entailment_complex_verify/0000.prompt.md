You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 3, `s` is the last input string processed, `count` is the final count calculated from the last string, `flag` is True, and `j` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1. The value of `count` is determined by the length of the string minus one, adjusted based on whether the specific sequence '01' was found and the conditions within the loop were met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) and a binary string \( s \). For each test case, it calculates the number of segments in the binary string \( s \) where consecutive characters differ, adjusting the count if the sequence '01' is found. The function prints the final count for each test case and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the binary string has multiple segments of '0's followed by multiple segments of '1's. For example, consider the input string "010011". The program would output `2`, but the correct answer should be `3` because the string can be divided into "01", "0", and "11".

To fix this, the program needs to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and also ensure that each segment of '0's and '1's is counted separately. Here’s a revised version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        last_char = s[0]
        zero_segment_count = 0
        one_segment_count = 0
        
        for char in s:
            if char != last_char:
                if last_char == '0':
                    zero_segment_count += 1
                else:
                    one_segment_count += 1
                last_char = char
                count += 1
        
        # Adjust count if there are multiple segments of '0's or '1's
        if zero_segment_count > 1 or one_segment_count > 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count)

func()
```

This revised program correctly counts the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
