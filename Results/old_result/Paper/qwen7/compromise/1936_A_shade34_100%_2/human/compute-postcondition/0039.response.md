Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s` is a string
   - `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`
   - If `s` is the string '<', then `mak` is also equal to `i`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n`.
   - Since `i` is now `n`, the condition `i < n` will no longer hold true, and the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` will be updated to `n`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The variable `s` remains a string.
   - The variable `pans` remains a list containing the value of `i` (which is now `n`).
   - If `s` is the string '<', then `mak` will still be equal to `i` (which is now `n`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing the value of `n`, and if `s` is the string '<', then `mak` is also equal to `n`**.
