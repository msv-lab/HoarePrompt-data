Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `mak` is `i`, `s` is a string input by the user, `pans` is a list containing `i`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `pans` as a list containing the value of `i`. The values of `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
