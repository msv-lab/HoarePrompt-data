Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration (assuming the loop body increments `i`), if `i` was 1, it will become 2, and if `i` was 2, it will become 3.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is 3, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`mak`, `pans`, `mak2`, `s`, and the number of times `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
