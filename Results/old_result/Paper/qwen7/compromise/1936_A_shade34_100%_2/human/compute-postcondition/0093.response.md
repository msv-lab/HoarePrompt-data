Output State: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 2`, `i` is `len(pans) - 2`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, the current value of the input string is '<'**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `len(pans) - 2`) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged.
