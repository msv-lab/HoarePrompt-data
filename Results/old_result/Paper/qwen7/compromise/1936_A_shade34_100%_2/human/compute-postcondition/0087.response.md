Output State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) - 2`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `len(pans)` times.**

Explanation: The line `mak = 0` sets the variable `mak` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
