Output State: **mak is n+1, n is greater than 0, i is n, pans is a list containing all the values of i from 0 to n-1 inclusive, and len(pans) must be n.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`. Since the loop condition `i < len(pans)` is checked before each iteration, once `i` reaches `len(pans)`, the loop terminates. At this point, `mak` will be set to the last value of `i`, which is `n`, but since the loop condition fails when `i` becomes `n`, `mak` does not get updated further. Therefore, `mak` will be `n + 1` (since it was incremented one step beyond `len(pans) - 1`). The length of `pans` remains `n`, and the values within `pans` do not change during the loop iterations.
