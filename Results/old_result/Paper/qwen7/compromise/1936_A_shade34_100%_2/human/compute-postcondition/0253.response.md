Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where for each case, it interacts with an external entity to determine a specific permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1. It identifies two key elements, `mak` and `mak2`, through a series of queries. After determining these elements, it outputs the final value of `mak2` and the position of `mak` within the permutation. The function performs a total of 3n-3 queries and outputs the results accordingly.**
