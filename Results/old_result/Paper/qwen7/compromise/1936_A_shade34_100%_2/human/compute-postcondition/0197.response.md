Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string input by the user and its current value is '<', `mak` is equal to `i`**.

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, `mak` simply takes the value of `i`. The other variables (`n` and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
