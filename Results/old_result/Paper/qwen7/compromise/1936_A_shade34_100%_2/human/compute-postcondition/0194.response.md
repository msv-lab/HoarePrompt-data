Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the value of any variable. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the console immediately. However, since no variables are assigned or modified within this line of code, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
