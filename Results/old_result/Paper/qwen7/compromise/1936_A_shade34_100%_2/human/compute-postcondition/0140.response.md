Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 3; `s` is an input string; `pans` contains the integer 3.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `pans`. The other variables (`n` and `s`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 also remains valid.
