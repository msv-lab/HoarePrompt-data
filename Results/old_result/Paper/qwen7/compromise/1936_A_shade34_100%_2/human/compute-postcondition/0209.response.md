Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `mak` is `i`, `s` is a string input by the user**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 1`) to the variable `mak`. The other variables (`n`, `i_prev`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
