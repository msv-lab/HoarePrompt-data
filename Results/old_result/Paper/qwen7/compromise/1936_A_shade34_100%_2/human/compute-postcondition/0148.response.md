Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the object `pans`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `pans`**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `len(pans)`. This means `i` should start from `1` and go up to `n-1` (inclusive).

4. **Check the initial value of `i`**:
   - Initially, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to start, `i` needs to be `1` because the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`.

5. **Check the length of `pans`**:
   - The length of `pans` is `n`, as it contains integers from `0` to `n-1`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` needs to be `1` for the loop to start, we need to adjust `i` to `1`.
   - The length of `pans` is already `n`, so no adjustment is needed for `pans`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to n-1 inclusive, `mak2` is n-1, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the last iteration), `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called 2*n-1 times, and the condition `s == '<'` or `s == '='` is true based on the input received during the last iteration.**
