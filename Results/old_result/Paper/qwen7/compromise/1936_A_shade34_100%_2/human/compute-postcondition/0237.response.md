Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `mak` is set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `pans` is a list containing all the values from 0 to `n-1` inclusive. This means `pans` looks like `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - Since `n > 0`, `mak` is `n-1`, and `i` is `n`, we need to consider the values of these variables.
   - `pans` is a list with indices ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`.
   - `pans[mak]` refers to the last element of the list `pans`, which is `n-1`.
   - `pans[i]` refers to the element at index `n` in the list `pans`. However, since `pans` only goes up to `n-1`, `pans[i]` will be out of bounds if `i` is `n`. But in this context, it seems there might be a typo or misunderstanding because `i` should logically be within the range of the list.

Given the typical behavior and the fact that `i` is `n` and `pans` only goes up to `n-1`, it implies that the print statement might be intended to use `n-1` for both `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (as a placeholder)
- `pans[mak]` which is `n-1`
- `pans[mak]` again which is `n-1`
- `pans[i]` which is out of bounds but effectively treated as `n-1`

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-1'**
