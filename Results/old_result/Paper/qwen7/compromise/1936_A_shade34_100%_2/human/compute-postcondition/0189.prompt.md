Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration), `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, `mak2` is `n-1`, and the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration). If the input string `s` is '<', then `mak` remains `n-1`, `i` remains `n-1`, and `s` is updated to the new input from the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The output state remains unchanged, and the input string is read. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is equal to `i`. No other variables are affected.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output state remains unchanged, the input string is read, `mak` is `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
