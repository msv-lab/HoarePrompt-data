Output State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables (`i`, `pans`, and `mak2`) remain unchanged. The length of the input and the input itself ('>') are also not affected by this line of code.
