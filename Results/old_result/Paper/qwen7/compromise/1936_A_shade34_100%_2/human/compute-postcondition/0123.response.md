Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `pans` is a list containing 0.
   - `mak2` is `n-1`.
   - The current value of the input string `s` is `<`.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times.
   - The condition `s == '<'` is true.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The conditions related to `s` and `sys.stdout.flush()` are dependent on the loop body, but since no specific actions are mentioned, we assume these conditions remain the same unless explicitly changed inside the loop body.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `mak` remains 0.
- `i` becomes 1.
- `pans` remains `[0]`.
- `mak2` remains `n-1`.
- The current value of the input string `s` remains `<`.
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times (this does not change per iteration).
- The condition `s == '<'` remains true.

State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `pans` is `[0]`, `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is `<`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times, and the condition `s == '<'` is true.**
