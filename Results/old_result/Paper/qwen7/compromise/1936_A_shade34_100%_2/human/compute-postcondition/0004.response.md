Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Here, `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. Therefore, it will be printed as is.

The output will include the literal string `'?'`, followed by `mak`, then another `mak`, and finally `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly given as 1, the output will include two instances of `1`.

Output: **'? mak mak 1 1'**
