Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string input by the user and is not equal to '<', `s` is '=', and `pans` has appended the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `s` was previously set to '=', and no other changes were made to `s`, it remains unchanged. The conditions for `n` and `s` also remain valid as per the initial state.
