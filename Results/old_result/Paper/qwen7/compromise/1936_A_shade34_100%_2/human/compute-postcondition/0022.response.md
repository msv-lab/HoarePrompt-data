Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `i` is equal to `n-1`, `mak` is the maximum value between `n-1` and 1 (since `mak` is updated to `i` when the input is '<' and `i` starts from 1), and `n` remains as the input integer provided initially.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than the input integer `n`. The variable `mak` will hold the highest value that `i` was assigned during the loop's execution, which is either `n-1` or 1 depending on whether the input was '<' at any point during the loop. The variable `n` will remain unchanged as it was in the initial state.
