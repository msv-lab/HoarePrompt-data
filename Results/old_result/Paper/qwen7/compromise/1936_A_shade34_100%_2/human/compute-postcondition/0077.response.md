Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mak` is either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`. This means if `n` is 4 (for example), then `pans` would be `[3, 2, 1, 0]`.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, but this does not affect the content being printed.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

Given the values:
- `mak` is either 0 or 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`.

We need to determine the value of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`:
- Since `i` is 3, `pans[i]` refers to the fourth element in the list `pans` (index 3).
- If `n` is 4, `pans` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, so `pans[i]` is `0`.
- `pans[mak]` depends on the value of `mak`:
  - If `mak` is 0, then `pans[mak]` is `3`.
  - If `mak` is 1, then `pans[mak]` is `2`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with the following components:
- A question mark (`?`).
- The value of `pans[mak]` (either 3 or 2).
- The value of `pans[mak]` again (same as above).
- The value of `pans[i]`, which is `0`.
- The value of `pans[i]` again (same as above).

Since `mak` can be either 0 or 1, let's consider both cases:
- If `mak` is 0: `pans[mak]` is 3, and the output will be `? 3 3 0 0`.
- If `mak` is 1: `pans[mak]` is 2, and the output will be `? 2 2 0 0`.

Thus, the output will depend on the value of `mak`, but it will always follow the pattern `? [value] [value] 0 0`.

Output: **? 3 3 0 0 or ? 2 2 0 0 (depending on the value of mak, which is either 0 or 1)**
