Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is equal to `i` (which is `n-1`), `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and the standard output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `mak` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `len(pans)` must be `n`. If the input string is `'>',` then `mak` remains `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `mak` is `i`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `len(pans)` must be `n`. If the input string is `'>',` then `mak` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `mak` is `i`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and the input string is compared with '>', but no changes are made to the variables based on the comparison result.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
