The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string can be split into two parts such that the first part is the reverse of the second part, or if the string can be made into a palindrome by removing at most one character. If such a condition is met, it prints "YES" along with the number of operations needed and the modified string; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function ensures that all possible conditions have been checked and outputs the final results accordingly.
