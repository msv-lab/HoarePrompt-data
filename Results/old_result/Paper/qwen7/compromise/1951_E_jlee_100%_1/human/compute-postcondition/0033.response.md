- `i` is 0
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string
- `n` is 1
- `done` is `False`
- The first character of the list `s` (`x`) is not equal to the last element of the list `s`
- `s.count(x)` is equal to 0
- The count of `x` in the list `s` is equal to `n`

The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`.
