Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is `False`, the first character of the list `s` (`x`) is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, and the count of the first character `x` in the list `s` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement itself, all the preconditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
