Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `count` is 1, and `count2` is 2.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `j` will still be 1 because `n` is 1, meaning there's only one iteration of the loop. The variable `done` is set to `True` after the first condition is met (either when `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]` or when `s[j] != x` and certain conditions on `count` and `count2` are met). The value of `count` is 1 because it was incremented once during the loop, and `count2` is 2 because it was set to 2 when `s[j]` was found to be equal to `x` and `count` was already 1.
