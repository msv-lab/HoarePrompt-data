Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, and `count` is 1. If `count2` is less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
