Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s`.
   - `done` is `True`.
   - `count` is either 0 or 1.
   - There is a loop that checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If they are not equal, `count` is incremented to 1 and the loop continues; otherwise, `count` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

Given that `j` is 1, let's analyze the slicing operations:
- `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:1 - 1]` which simplifies to `string[0:0]`. This results in an empty string because it is asking for characters from index 0 up to but not including index 0.
- `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[1 - 1:]` which simplifies to `string[0:]`. This results in the entire string `s` because it is asking for characters from index 0 to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'', string**
