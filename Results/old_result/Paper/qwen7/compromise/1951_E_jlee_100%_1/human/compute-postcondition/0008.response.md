Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` which is 1, `done` is `False` and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop specified in the given code, the `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the variables remain in their initial states, and the `continue` statement indicates that the loop continues.
