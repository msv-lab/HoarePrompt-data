Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`. Therefore, we need to focus on these variables.

2. **Determine the Initial Values of the Loop Variables**:
   - `j`: This variable is initialized to 0 in the loop head.
   - `n`: This variable is given as 1 in the state before the loop.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**:
   - The loop `for j in range(n):` will execute as long as `j < n`.
   - Given `n` is 1, the loop will execute if `j` is less than 1.
   - Since `j` starts at 0, the condition `j < 1` is true, so the loop will execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the initial value of `j` is 0 and `n` is 1, which aligns with the given conditions.
   - No other states need to be adjusted since the loop head only involves `j` and `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 1**
