Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `count + 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `x` is a character
- `count` is greater than 0
- `done` remains unchanged (though `done` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned for completeness)

The print statement is `print(string)`. Since `string` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will be the string `string`.

Output: **string**
