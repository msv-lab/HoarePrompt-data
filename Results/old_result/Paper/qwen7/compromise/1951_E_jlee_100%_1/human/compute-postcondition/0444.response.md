Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, and `count` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, then either `count2` is equal to `count` (if `count > 1`) or 0 (if `count <= 1`), and if `count2` is less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `count2` remains unchanged.
