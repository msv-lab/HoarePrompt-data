Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`.**

The code sets `done` to `True`, which changes the value of `done` from `False` to `True`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s` is still valid.
