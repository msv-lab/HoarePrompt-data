Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is the length of the list `s`; `done` is `True`; `count` is 0; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
