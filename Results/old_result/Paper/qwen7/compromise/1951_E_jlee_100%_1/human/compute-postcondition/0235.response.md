Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is assigned the value of `count`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is a character.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is less than `count`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given the conditions:
- `j` is the value of `count`, so `string[:j]` will be the substring of `s` from the start up to but not including the `count`-th character.
- `string[j:]` will be the substring of `s` starting from the `count`-th character to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output these two substrings separated by a space.

Output: **string[:count] string[count:]**
