Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `done` is True
- `count` is 1

The print statement is simply `print(2)`. Since no conditions or loops are involved in this snippet, and the value to be printed is explicitly stated as `2`, we can directly determine the output.

Output: **2**
