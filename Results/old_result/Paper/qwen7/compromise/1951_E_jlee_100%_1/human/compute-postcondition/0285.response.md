Output State: **`j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, and `count` is greater than 0 and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, the values of `j`, `n`, `x`, and `count` remain unchanged. The only impact is that the loop continues.
