Given the initial state:
- `j` is 0
- `n` is the length of the list `s`
- `done` is `True`
- `count` is greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- The value of `count2` is less than `count`

We need to evaluate the expression `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `j` is 0, `string[:j]` is equivalent to `string[0:0]`, which is an empty string `""`.
2. `string[j:]` is equivalent to `string[0:]`, which means the entire list `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'', string**
