Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0.
- `n` is the length of the list `s`.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement: `string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:]`

1. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` evaluates to -1.
2. In Python, slicing with a negative start index (like `-1`) starts from the end of the string and moves backwards. Specifically, `string[: -1]` means "from the beginning of the string up to but not including the last character."
3. Similarly, `string[-1:]` means "from the last character to the last character," which is just the last character of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output the substring from the start of the string to the second-to-last character, followed by the last character of the string.

Output: **string[:-1], string[-1]**
