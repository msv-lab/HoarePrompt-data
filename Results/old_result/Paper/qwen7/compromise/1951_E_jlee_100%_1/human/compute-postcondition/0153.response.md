Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `count` is 1**.

The code `done = True` does not change the values of any variables. It only updates the value of `done` to `True`. Since the initial state already had `done` as `True`, the value of `done` remains unchanged. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `count`) also remain in their initial states.
