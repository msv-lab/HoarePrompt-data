Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 0**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all variables with their original values.
