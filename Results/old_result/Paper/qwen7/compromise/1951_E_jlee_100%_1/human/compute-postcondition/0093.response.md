Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 1, `done` is set to True, `count` remains 0, `count2` is 1.**

The code `count2 += 1` increments the value of `count2` by 1. Initially, `count2` was not specified, but since no other value is given, we assume it was 0. After executing the code, `count2` becomes 1. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `done`, and `count`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
