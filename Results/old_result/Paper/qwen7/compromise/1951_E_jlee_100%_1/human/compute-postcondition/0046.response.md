Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `n` is 1
- The character at index `j` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of string `s`.

Let's break down the string indexing:

- The character at index `j` (which is 0) of string `s` is the first character of `s`.
- The character at index `n - 1 - j` (which is `1 - 1 - 0` or `0`) of string `s` is also the first character of `s`.

However, it is given that the character at index `j` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of string `s`. This implies that the string `s` must have at least two characters, and these characters at the specified indices are different.

Given this information, the print statement `print(1)` will simply print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
