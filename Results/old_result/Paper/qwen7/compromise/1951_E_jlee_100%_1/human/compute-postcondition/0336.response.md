Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `count`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `x` is a character
- `count` is greater than 0
- `done` remains unchanged
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `done` becomes True

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

1. `string[:j - 1]` will give us the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the character at position `j - 1`.
2. `string[j - 1:]` will give us the substring starting from the character at position `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

Given that `j` is `count` and `count` is greater than 0, let's assume `count` is some positive integer `k` (since it's not specified, we can use `k` as a placeholder). This means `j` is also `k`.

So, the substrings will be:
- `string[:k - 1]`: All characters from the start of `string` up to but not including the `k-1`th character.
- `string[k - 1:]`: All characters from the `(k-1)`th character to the end of `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output these two substrings separated by a space.

Output: **string[:k - 1] string[k - 1:]**
