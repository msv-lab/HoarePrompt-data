The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then applies a specific update rule to each element in the list `a` for `n-1` iterations, storing the final computed value in a list. Finally, it outputs the computed values for each test case, one per line.
