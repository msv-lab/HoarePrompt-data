Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it calculates the year when the nth sign will occur by following the logic specified in the problem statement.
4. The logic used to calculate the next year is correct: `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is found, considering that the previous sign has just occurred.
5. The final result for each test case is appended to the `results` list as a string, and the list is joined with newlines before being written to stdout.
6. The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating through them and processing each one independently.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
