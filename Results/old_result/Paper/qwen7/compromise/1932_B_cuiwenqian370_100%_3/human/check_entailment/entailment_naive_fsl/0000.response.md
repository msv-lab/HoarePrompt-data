Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic used to determine the next year when a sign will occur is flawed. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

The program should calculate the year when the 6th sign will occur based on the sequential occurrence of the previous signs. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this sequential logic. 

To illustrate, let's walk through the example step-by-step:
1. The first sign occurs in year 50.
2. The second sign occurs in year 51 (since the first sign occurred in year 50, we start from year 51).
3. The third sign occurs in year 51 + 711 = 762 (since the second sign occurred in year 51, we start from year 51).
4. The fourth sign occurs in year 762 + 200 = 962 (since the third sign occurred in year 762, we start from year 762).
5. The fifth sign occurs in year 962 + 503 = 1465 (since the fourth sign occurred in year 962, we start from year 962).
6. The sixth sign occurs in year 1465 + 1006 = 2471 (since the fifth sign occurred in year 1465, we start from year 1465).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the next year for each sign, leading to an incorrect result. For example, the program might incorrectly calculate the next year for the third sign as 51 + 711, which is not correct because it should be the next multiple of 711 after 51. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
