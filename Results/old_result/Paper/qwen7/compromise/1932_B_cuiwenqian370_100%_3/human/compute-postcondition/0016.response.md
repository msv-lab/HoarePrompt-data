Output State: **`i` is now 3; `last_year` remains unchanged; `next_year` is calculated as (last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The variable `last_year` remains unchanged from its previous state. The variable `next_year` is calculated using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, where `i` is now 3. Since `a[2]` is not specified, it remains as `a[2]` in the expression.
