Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, `results` is a list of integers, `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to `next_year`. This value is the same as the current value of `last_year` because the expression simplifies to `last_year` itself. Therefore, `next_year` is assigned the value of `last_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
