Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `n` is an input integer, `index` is increased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by mapping integers from a slice of `data` starting from `index` and having a length of `n`. The values of `T`, `i`, `last_year`, `results`, `n`, and `index` remain unchanged except that `index` is increased by 1. The list `a` is initialized with these mapped integers.
