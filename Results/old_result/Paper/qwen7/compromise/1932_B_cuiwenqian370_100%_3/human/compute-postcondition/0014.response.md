Output State: **`i` is 1, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `last_year` to be equal to `next_year`. Given the initial state, `next_year` is defined as `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`, which simplifies to `last_year // a[1] * a[1]`. Since `last_year` is assigned the same value, the value of `last_year` remains unchanged from its initial state. The value of `i` remains 1 as it was not affected by the code.
