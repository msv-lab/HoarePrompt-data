Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `last_year` is `a[0]`, `results` is a list containing integers converted from the string at index `index` to `index + n`, `index` is `index + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `last_year = a[0]` assigns the value of the first element of the list `a` to the variable `last_year`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
