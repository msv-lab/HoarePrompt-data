Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`. Specifically, the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 until `i` is no longer less than `n`.

4. **Initial Values and Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be set to 1 initially (since the loop starts with `i = 1`).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Other Variables Not in the Loop Head**:
   - `T`, `last_year`, `results`, `index`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
