Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `i` is `n`, `last_year` is unchanged, `results` is a list containing a single string element which is the str representation of `last_year`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. The initial values of `T`, `i`, `last_year`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` remains `T-1`, `i` remains `n`, `last_year` remains unchanged, `results` remains a list containing the string representation of `last_year`, and `n` is now set to the integer value of `data[index]`.
