Output State: **`T` must be at least 1; `index` is increased by `n`; `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increases the value of `index` by `n`. The conditions and values of `T` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` must still be at least 1, and `a` is still a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from the original `index` and of length `n`. The new value of `index` is the original value plus `n`.
