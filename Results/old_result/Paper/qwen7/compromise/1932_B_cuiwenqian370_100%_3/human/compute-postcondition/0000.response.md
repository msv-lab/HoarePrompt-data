Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. It only changes how the `input` function is used in the program from now on.
