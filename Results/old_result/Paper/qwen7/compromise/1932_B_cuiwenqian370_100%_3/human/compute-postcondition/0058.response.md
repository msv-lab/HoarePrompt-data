Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]).

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The condition `n` must be greater than 2 ensures that the loop ran at least three times. The variable `last_year` will be equal to `next_year`, which is the value calculated in the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `next_year` is computed as ((`last_year` + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), indicating that `last_year` has been updated to this value after the final iteration.
