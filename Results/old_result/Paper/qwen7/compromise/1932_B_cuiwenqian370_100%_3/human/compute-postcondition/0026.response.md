Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `last_year` is unchanged, `results` is a list containing a single string element which is the str representation of `last_year`, and `index` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `index` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `T` is `T-1`, `i` is `n`, `last_year` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`, and `index` is now one more than its original value.
