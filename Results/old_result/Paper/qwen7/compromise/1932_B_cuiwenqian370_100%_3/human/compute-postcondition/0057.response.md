Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1])

**Natural Language Explanation:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`. This means the loop has completed all its iterations. The condition `n` must be greater than 0 ensures the loop can run at least once. The variable `last_year` will hold the final value of `next_year`, which is calculated as ((`last_year` + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]). This formula represents the process of adjusting `last_year` to the nearest multiple of `a[i]` for each iteration of the loop, starting from `i=1` up to `i=n-1`.
