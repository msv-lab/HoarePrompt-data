Functionality: **The function reads pairs of non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) from standard input until the end of input is reached. It then checks whether the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob'. If the sum is odd, it prints 'alice'. The function does not return any value but modifies the state of \(a\) and \(b\) based on the last valid input received.**
