Based on the initial state provided:

- `power` is explicitly given as 14.
- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `i` is the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15, but this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `n` is greater than \(2^{15} = 32768\), but this value is also not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `power` is not equal to `n`, but again, this value is not needed for the current print statement.

The print statement `print(2 ** power)` will calculate \(2\) raised to the power of `power`, which is 14.

So, the calculation is \(2^{14}\).

\(2^{14} = 16384\).

Output: **16384**
