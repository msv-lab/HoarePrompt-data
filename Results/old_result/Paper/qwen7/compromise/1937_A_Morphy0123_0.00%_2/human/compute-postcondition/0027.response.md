Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `while power < log2(n):`.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `power`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `power < log2(n)`.

4. **Current state of `power`**: The current state of `power` is 1.

5. **Current state of `n`**: The current state of `n` is an input integer, but we don't need to adjust this directly since it affects `log2(n)` indirectly.

6. **Determine the required state of `power`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`. Since `power` is currently 1, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to start.

7. **Conclusion**: We need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 1. This means `n` must be greater than 2 (since \( \log_2(2) = 1 \)).

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is related to `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`power` is 1, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), and `n` must be greater than 2**.
