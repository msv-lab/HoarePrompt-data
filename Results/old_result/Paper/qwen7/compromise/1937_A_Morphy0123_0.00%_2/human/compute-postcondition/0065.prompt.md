Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n_cases` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        while power < log2(n):
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is either 1 or the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15, `n` must be an input integer, and `power` is either equal to or not equal to `n` depending on the condition in the if statement. If `n` equals 1, `i` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15, and `n` must be greater than \(2^{15} = 32768\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), `n` is an input integer, and `power` is either equal to `n` if `n` is 1, or `power` is 15 and `n` is greater than or equal to 16384.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is incremented by either 1 or 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\log_2(n)\). If `n` is 1, `power` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is adjusted based on whether it equals `n` or is set to the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\log_2(n)\) minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
