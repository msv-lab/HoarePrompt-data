Postcondition: `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, `i` is incremented by either 1 or 2, and `n_cases` remains unchanged. If `power` equals `n`, then `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` minus 1.
