Output State: **`n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), `n` is an input integer, and `power` is either equal to or not equal to `n` depending on the condition in the if statement; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
