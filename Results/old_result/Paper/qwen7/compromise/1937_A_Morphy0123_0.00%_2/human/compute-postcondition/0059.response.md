Output State: **`power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` minus 1, `i` is incremented by either 1 or 2, and `n_cases` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `power` is decremented by 1. The initial state mentioned that `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. After decrementing by 1, `power` becomes one less than its original value. The values of `i` and `n_cases` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
