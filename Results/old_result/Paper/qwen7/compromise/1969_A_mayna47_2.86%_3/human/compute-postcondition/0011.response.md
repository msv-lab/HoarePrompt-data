Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a predefined set of inputs (t, n, p) where t is an integer between 1 and 5000, n is an integer between 2 and 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers each between 1 and n, excluding the index i. The function returns a value based on the given conditions.**

Note: Since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters (`def func_1():`), the description focuses on the implied input constraints and the expected return value based on those constraints.
