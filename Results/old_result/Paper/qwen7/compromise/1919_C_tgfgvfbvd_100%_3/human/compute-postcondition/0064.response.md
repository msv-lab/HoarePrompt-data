Output State: **`a` is infinity, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `x` is `n-1` where `n` must be greater than 0.**

This means that the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to `l[x]`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
