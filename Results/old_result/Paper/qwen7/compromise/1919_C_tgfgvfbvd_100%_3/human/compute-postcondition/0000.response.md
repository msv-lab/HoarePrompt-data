Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head consists of the variable used in the `range` function, which is `_`. This variable is used to iterate over the input from `input()`.

2. **Understand the Input**: The input is read using `input()`, and it is expected to be a positive integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the loop will run `t` times.

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**: Since the loop will run based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range. Additionally, each iteration of the loop will read another integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. However, these variables (`n` and the list) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

4. **Formulate the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `t` to ensure it is within the valid range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
