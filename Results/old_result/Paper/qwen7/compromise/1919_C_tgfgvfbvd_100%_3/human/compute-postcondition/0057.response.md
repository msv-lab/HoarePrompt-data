Output State: **`a` is equal to the initial value of `b`, which is infinity; `b` is equal to the initial value of `a`, which is infinity; `c` is 0; `l` is a list of integers entered by the user; `x` is `n-1`, where `n` must be greater than 0.**

This means that the values of `a` and `b` have swapped, both now being infinity, while `c`, `l`, and the relationship between `x` and `n` remain unchanged.
