Postcondition: `x` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is `l[2]`, `b` is `l[1]` if `l[2] <= a` is true, otherwise `b` is the original value of `a`, and `c` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is either retained from its original value or incremented by 1.
