Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the minimum value found in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest value found in the list `l`, `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are strictly greater than `b`, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `l`. The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `l` now contains the integers entered by the user.
