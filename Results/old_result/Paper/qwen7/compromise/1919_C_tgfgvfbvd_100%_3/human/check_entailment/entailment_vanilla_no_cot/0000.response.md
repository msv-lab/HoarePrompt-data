Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not properly split the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) to minimize the penalty. Instead, it tries to find the minimum number of insertions needed to make the array sorted, which is not the same as splitting the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the definition of the penalty function \(p(b)\), which counts the number of indices \(i\) where \(b_i < b_{i+1}\). We need to split the array into two subsequences such that the sum of penalties of these two subsequences is minimized.

Here's a more appropriate approach to solve the problem:

1. Sort the array.
2. Split the sorted array into two parts at different positions to minimize the penalty.
3. Calculate the penalty for both parts and sum them up.

Let's implement this approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        sorted_l = sorted(l)
        
        min_penalty = float('inf')
        
        # Try all possible splits
        for i in range(1, n):
            penalty_s = sum(1 for j in range(i) if sorted_l[j] < sorted_l[j + 1])
            penalty_t = sum(1 for j in range(i, n) if sorted_l[j] < sorted_l[j + 1])
            min_penalty = min(min_penalty, penalty_s + penalty_t)
        
        print(min_penalty)

func()
```

This approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to split the array and find the one with the minimum penalty.
