Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is an integer) to the variable `t`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
