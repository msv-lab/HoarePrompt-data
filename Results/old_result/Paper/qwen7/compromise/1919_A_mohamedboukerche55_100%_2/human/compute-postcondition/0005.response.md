Functionality: **The function reads a number `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, checks if their sum is even or odd, and prints 'Bob' if the sum is even, otherwise prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value.**
