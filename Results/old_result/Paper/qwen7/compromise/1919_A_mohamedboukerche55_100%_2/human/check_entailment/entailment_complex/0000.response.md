Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. The program simply checks whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly. However, the actual winning condition in the game is more complex than just the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

According to the game rules:
- If a player has no coins left in their wallet, they lose.
- Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to ensure they do not lose.

The key insight here is that the player whose turn it is when the number of coins in both wallets is equal (i.e., `a == b`) will lose because they will be forced to swap wallets and then be unable to make a move (since swapping again would result in the same situation).

Given this, the correct logic should be:
- If `a == b`, the player whose turn it is will lose, so the other player wins.
- Otherwise, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position by ensuring that the number of coins in the wallets becomes equal at some point during the game.

The provided solution does not account for these conditions. It only checks the parity of the sum, which is not sufficient to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy described.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
