Output State: **`g[1]` contains at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, and the `stack` contains a tuple `(node, x)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((node, x))` appends a tuple containing `node` and `x` to the `stack`. This operation does not change the values of `g[1]`, `node`, or `p`. It only adds a new tuple to the `stack`. Therefore, the values of `g[1]`, `node`, and `p` remain unchanged, and the `stack` now includes the newly appended tuple.
