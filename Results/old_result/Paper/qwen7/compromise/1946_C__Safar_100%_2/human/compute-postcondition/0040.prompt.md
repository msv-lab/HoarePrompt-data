You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `edges` is a list of tuples that must contain all the edges to be processed, `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `edges`, `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `edges`, and `g[b]` is a list that contains all the nodes connected to node `b`.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `c` is 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is less than or equal to `n // k`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value based on the conditions inside the loop.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop continues to halve the search range between `l` and `r` until `l` becomes greater than `r`. At this point, the loop terminates. The value of `c` remains 0 because no changes were made to it within the loop. The variable `l` will be just past the midpoint where `check(mid)` would return false, and `r` will be just before the midpoint where `check(mid)` would return true, or both could be equal if the exact midpoint satisfies the condition. The variable `mid` will hold the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's final iteration.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the value just before l exceeds it, and it is just before the midpoint where check(mid) would return true)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 
#
#- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
#- `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed.
#- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(a, b)` represents an edge connecting vertices `a` and `b`.
#
#After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following conditions:
#- If `k` is greater than `n-1`, the function returns an error message indicating that the number of edges to remove cannot exceed the number of edges in the tree.
#- Otherwise, the function returns the list of edges after removing `k` edges from the original list.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` representing the number of vertices, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of edges. It then returns the list of edges after removing `k` edges, or an error message if `k` exceeds the number of edges in the tree.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
