Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple (1, 1), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n - 1`, `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `r` is 1.**

The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` is 0, so after executing this line, `r` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
