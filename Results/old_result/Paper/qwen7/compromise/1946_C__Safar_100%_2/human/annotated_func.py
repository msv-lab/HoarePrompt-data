#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `edges` is a list of tuples that must contain all the edges to be processed, `a` is the first element of the last tuple in `edges`, `b` is the second element of the last tuple in `edges`, and `g[b]` is a list that contains all the nodes connected to node `b`.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `c` is 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is less than or equal to `n // k`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value based on the conditions inside the loop.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop continues to halve the search range between `l` and `r` until `l` becomes greater than `r`. At this point, the loop terminates. The value of `c` remains 0 because no changes were made to it within the loop. The variable `l` will be just past the midpoint where `check(mid)` would return false, and `r` will be just before the midpoint where `check(mid)` would return true, or both could be equal if the exact midpoint satisfies the condition. The variable `mid` will hold the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's final iteration.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the value just before l exceeds it, and it is just before the midpoint where check(mid) would return true)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(a, b)` represents an edge connecting vertices `a` and `b`.

The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the `edges` list. It then performs a binary search to find a value `r` such that `check(mid)` returns false, where `mid` is the midpoint of the current search range. After the loop, the function prints the value of `r`, which indicates the maximum number of edges that can be removed without violating certain conditions.

If `k` is greater than `n-1`, the function does not return any value due to an implicit error condition. Otherwise, the function implicitly returns the list of edges after potentially removing `k` edges, although this is not explicitly stated in the provided code.
