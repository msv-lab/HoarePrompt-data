Output State: `i` is `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. During each iteration, it checks if `q` (which is `l[p - 1]`) equals `i + 1`. If this condition is met at any point, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1`, then breaks out of the loop. Since the output states after the first three iterations indicate that the loop has been breaking on the third iteration, it means that the condition `q == i + 1` was met when `i` was `2`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and the loop will have completed its execution without further changes to `j`, `p`, or `q`.
