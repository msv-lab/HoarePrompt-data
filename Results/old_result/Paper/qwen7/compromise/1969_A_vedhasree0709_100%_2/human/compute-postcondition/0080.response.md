Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and a new input string is split and converted to a list of integers.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `l`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.
