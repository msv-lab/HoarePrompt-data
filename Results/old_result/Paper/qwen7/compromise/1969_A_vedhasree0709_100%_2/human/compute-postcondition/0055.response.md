The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. The variable `i` must be less than `n - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
2. The variable `n` must be at least 1 (as given in the problem statement).

Given the current state:
- `i` is 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 1.
- `p` is the integer at index 0 of the list `l`.
- `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `n` must remain at least 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1**
