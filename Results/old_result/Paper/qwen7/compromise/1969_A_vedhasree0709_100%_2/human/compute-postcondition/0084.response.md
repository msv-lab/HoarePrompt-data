Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` must be at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer; `j` is 0; `p` is the integer at index `i` of the list `l`; `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `p = l[i]` assigns the value at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `p`. Since `i` is 0, `p` now holds the first element of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
