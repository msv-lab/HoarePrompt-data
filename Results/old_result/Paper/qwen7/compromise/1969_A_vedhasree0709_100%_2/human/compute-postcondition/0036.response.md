Postcondition: **`i` is 6, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, `p` is the integer at index 5 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and if `q` does not equal `i + 1` (which is 7), the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n - 1`.**
