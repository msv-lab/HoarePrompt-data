Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 1 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`**.

Explanation: The code `p = l[i]` assigns the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l` to the variable `p`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `p` now holds the value of the first element in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
