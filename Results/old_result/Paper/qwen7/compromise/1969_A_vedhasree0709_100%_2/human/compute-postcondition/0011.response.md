Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `i` (which is now the first element of the list `l`), `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is assigned the value `1`. All other variables retain their previous values according to the initial state.
