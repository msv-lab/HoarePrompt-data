Output State: **After all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1`, and `n` will remain the same as the initial value.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n`. Each iteration increments `j` by 1. Therefore, after the loop completes, `j` will be one more than the last value it reached, which is `n`. The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so its value remains the same as the initial value.
