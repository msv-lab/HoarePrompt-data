Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
2. `i` is explicitly set to 2.
3. `n` is an input integer, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

The `print('2 3')` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, or `n`. It directly prints the string `'2 3'`.

Output: **2 3**
