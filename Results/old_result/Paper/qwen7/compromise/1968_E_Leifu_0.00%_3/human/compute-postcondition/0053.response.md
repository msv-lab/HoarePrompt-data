Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, it prints a sequence of pairs of integers. If \( n = 3 \), it prints "2 3". Otherwise, it prints "2 4" followed by pairs of integers from "4" to \( n \) paired with themselves. The function does not return any value but outputs the specified sequences of pairs to the console.**
