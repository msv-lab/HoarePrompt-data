Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized inside the loop as `j` starts from 4 (inclusive) and goes up to `n + 1` (exclusive).
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that the loop condition `4 <= n` is satisfied.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
