Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `j` is `n + 1`.
2. The print statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

Given this, let's break it down:

- `j` is defined as `n + 1`.
- The print statement concatenates `str(j)` with a space and then again with `str(j)`.
- Therefore, the output will be the string representation of `j` followed by a space and then the string representation of `j` again.

Since `j` is `n + 1`, the output will be:

Output: **(n + 1) (n + 1)**
