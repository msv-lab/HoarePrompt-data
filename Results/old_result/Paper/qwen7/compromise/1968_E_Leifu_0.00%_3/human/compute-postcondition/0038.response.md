Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
2. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
3. The variable `n` is defined as an input integer, but its value is not specified in the initial state. It is assigned the value of `int(input())` during the execution of the code.

The `print('1 2')` statement will print the string '1 2' directly, regardless of the value of `n`.

Output: **1 2**
