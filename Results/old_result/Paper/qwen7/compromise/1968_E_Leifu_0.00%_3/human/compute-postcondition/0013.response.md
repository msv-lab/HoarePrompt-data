Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs as long as `j` is in the range `4` to `n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 5.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least 5.
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 4 and goes up to `n + 1`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop will start with `j = 4` and increment `j` by 1 each time until it reaches `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `n` must still be at least 5.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value, which was 4. Therefore, `j` will be 5 for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 5, `j` is 5**
