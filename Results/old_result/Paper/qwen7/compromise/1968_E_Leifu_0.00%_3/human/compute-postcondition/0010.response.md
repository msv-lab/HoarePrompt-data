Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 4.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

However, there is no definition or initialization of the variable `j` in the given initial state. Since `j` is not defined, it is impossible to determine its value. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific output for `j`.

Output: **str(j) + ' ' + str(j) (where j is an undefined variable)**
