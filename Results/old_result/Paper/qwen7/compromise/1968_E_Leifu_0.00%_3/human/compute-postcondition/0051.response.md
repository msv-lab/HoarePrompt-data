Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, i is 3, and n is an input integer.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The loop variable `i` is set to 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` remains as the last input integer provided during any iteration of the loop, as it is redefined in each iteration of the outer loop.
