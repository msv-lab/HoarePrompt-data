Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 5.
- `j` is 5.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Here, `j` is explicitly defined as 5. Therefore, the expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` will concatenate the string representation of `j` with a space in between, resulting in the string "5 5".

Output: **5 5**
