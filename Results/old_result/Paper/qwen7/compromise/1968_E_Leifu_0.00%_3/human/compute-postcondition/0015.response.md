Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 6, `j` is 6.

After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, because the loop increments `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, if the loop runs its full course, `j` will be set to `n`. Given that the loop runs as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, and considering it executes up to the final value of `n`, `j` will be `n` at the end. Since the loop condition is `range(4, n + 1)`, `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to run all its iterations.
