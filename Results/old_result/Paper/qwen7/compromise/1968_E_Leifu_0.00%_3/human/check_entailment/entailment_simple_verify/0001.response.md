### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of the grid.
   - The program always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `(2, 3)`.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(2, 4)` and then a series of coordinates from `(4, 4)` to `(n, n)`.

2. **Verification of Specific Cases**:
   - **For \(n = 2\)**:
     - The program prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1\}\).
     - This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.
   - **For \(n = 3\)**:
     - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
     - This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3.
   - **For \(n > 3\)**:
     - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and then pairs \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
     - This configuration ensures that the distances include:
       - Distances involving `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \(\{0, 1\}\).
       - Distances involving `(2, 4)` and other points: \(\{2, 3, 4, \ldots, n-1\}\).
       - Distances involving points \((j, j)\): \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

3. **General Case Analysis**:
   - The program ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) includes all possible Manhattan distances from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - However, the configuration provided does not necessarily cover all possible distances for larger \(n\). Specifically, the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) do not generate all distances involving the edge of the grid, especially for larger \(n\).

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \(n = 4\):
     - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(4, 5)`.
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).
     - However, the distance between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)` is 5, but the distance between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 5)` is 6, which means the set \(\mathcal{H}\) should include 6, but the program only generates up to 5.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\). For larger \(n\), the configuration may miss some distances, leading to a smaller \(\mathcal{H}\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not correct because it does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).
