Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\). Specifically, the program hardcodes some values and does not generalize well for larger \(n\). For example, for \(n=3\), the program outputs:

```
1 1
1 2
2 3
```

This configuration indeed maximizes \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n=3\), but for \(n > 3\), the program's approach is flawed. For \(n=4\), the program outputs:

```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
4 4
```

This does not maximize \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n=4\). A better approach would involve placing points in a way that maximizes the distinct Manhattan distances, such as placing points on the boundary or in a more strategic manner to cover a wider range of distances.
