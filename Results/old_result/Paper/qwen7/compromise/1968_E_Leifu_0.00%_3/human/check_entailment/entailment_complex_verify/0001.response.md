### Reasoning:

1. **Analysis of the Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases) and an integer `n` (size of the grid).
   - For each test case, the program prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `(2, 3)`.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(2, 4)` and then a series of coordinates from `(4, 4)` to `(n, n)`.

2. **Verification of the Approach:**
   - **Case \( n = 2 \):**
     - The program prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1\}\).
     - This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.
   - **Case \( n = 3 \):**
     - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
     - This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3.
   - **Case \( n > 3 \):**
     - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and then pairs \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
     - This configuration ensures that the distances include:
       - Distances involving `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \(\{0, 1\}\).
       - Distances involving `(2, 4)` and other points: \(\{2, 3, 4, \ldots, n-1\}\).
       - Distances involving points \((j, j)\): \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

     However, upon closer inspection, the provided solution does not cover all possible distances for \( n > 3 \). Specifically, the distances involving `(2, 4)` and other points do not necessarily cover all values from 2 to \( n-1 \). For example, for \( n = 4 \), the printed coordinates are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`. The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), missing the distance 4.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The program fails to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \( n > 3 \). The provided solution does not ensure that all possible distances from 0 to \( n-1 \) are covered, as demonstrated by the example for \( n = 4 \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n > 3 \).
