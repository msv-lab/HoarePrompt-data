### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any two cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code initializes \( t \) as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes \( n \) as the size of the grid.
   - It prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) for all \( n \geq 2 \).
   - If \( n = 3 \), it adds the coordinate \((2, 3)\).
   - For \( n > 3 \), it adds the coordinates \((2, 4)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).

3. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
   - For \( n = 2 \): The coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) give Manhattan distances \( 0 \) and \( 1 \). Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).
   - For \( n = 3 \): The coordinates \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\) give Manhattan distances \( 0, 1, 2, 3 \). Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
   - For \( n > 3 \): The coordinates \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \) ensure a wide range of distances. Specifically, the distances include \( 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1 \).

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly handles the base cases for \( n = 2 \) and \( n = 3 \).
   - For \( n > 3 \), the code ensures that the maximum number of distinct distances is achieved by including the diagonal elements and ensuring a range of distances from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \) within the specified range. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
