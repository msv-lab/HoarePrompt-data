### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and compare its behavior with the optimal solutions provided in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Case for \(n = 3\)**:
   - For \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     ```
   - This is incorrect as per the optimal solution, which should be:
     ```
     2 1
     2 3
     3 1
     ```
   - The optimal solution for \(n = 3\) results in the set of distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has 3 elements. However, the program's output only includes the distances \(\{0, 1\}\), resulting in a set size of 2.

3. **General Case for \(n > 3\)**:
   - For \(n > 3\), the program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     5 5
     ...
     ```
   - This pattern does not necessarily maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). For example, for \(n = 4\), the optimal solution is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 3
     4 3
     4 4
     ```
     - This results in the set of distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has 4 elements. However, the program's output only includes the distances \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), resulting in a set size of 3.

Given these observations, the program does not always produce the optimal solution for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
