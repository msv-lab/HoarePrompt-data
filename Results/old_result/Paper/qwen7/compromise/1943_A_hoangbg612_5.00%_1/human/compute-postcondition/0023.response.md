Output State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `cur` is being incremented. The value of `num` remains unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, `num` is still the next integer from the list `N`, and `cur` is increased by 1.
