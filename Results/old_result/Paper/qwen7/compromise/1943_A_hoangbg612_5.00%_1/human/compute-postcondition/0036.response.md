Output State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is `num`, and `M[4]` is either 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` updates the value of `cur` to be equal to the current value of `num`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `num` is the next integer from the list `N`, and `M[4]` is either 1 or 2, these conditions persist.
