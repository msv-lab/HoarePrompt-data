Output State: **`num` is an integer, `cur` is equal to `num`.**

The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. This means that `cur` now holds the same value as `num`. The conditions regarding `num` being greater than `cur + 1` or not remain unchanged, but since `cur` is now equal to `num`, the condition `num > cur + 1` will never be true. Therefore, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
