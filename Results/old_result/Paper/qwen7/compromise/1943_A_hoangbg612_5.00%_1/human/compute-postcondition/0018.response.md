Output State: **`M[cur]` is increased by 1, `num` is an integer, and `cur` is an integer with `num <= cur`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The values of `num` and `cur` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition `num <= cur` is still valid.
