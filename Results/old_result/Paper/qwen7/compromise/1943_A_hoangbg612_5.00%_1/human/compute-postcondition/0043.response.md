Postcondition: **All integers in the list `N` have been processed, and for each unique integer `k` in `N`, `M[k]` contains the count of how many times `k` appears consecutively without any integer between it and `cur` being larger than `cur + 1`. If no such `k` exists, `M[cur]` will contain the count of consecutive appearances of `cur` until the end of the list `N`. The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.**
