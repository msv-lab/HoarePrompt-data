Output State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. The initial state includes that `num` is the next integer from the list `N` and `cur` is an integer. After executing `cur += 1`, the value of `cur` is increased by 1, while the value of `num` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
