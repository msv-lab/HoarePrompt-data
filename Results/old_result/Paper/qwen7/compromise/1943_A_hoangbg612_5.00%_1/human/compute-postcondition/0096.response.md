Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `N` to iterate over.

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**:
   - If `num` is greater than `-1`, then `cur` becomes `num`, `_` remains `1`, `S` remains the same, `N` remains the same, and `M[cur]` is set to `1`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` remains `-1`, `_` remains `1`, `S` remains the same, `N` remains the same, and `num` becomes the second element of `N`, and `M[cur]` is set to `1`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the variable being iterated over, it will change in the next iteration.
   - If `num` was greater than `-1` in the previous iteration, `cur` would now be `num`.
   - If `num` was not greater than `-1`, `num` would now be the second element of `N`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `cur` will either remain `-1` or become the current value of `num`.
   - `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
   - All other variables (`_`, `S`, `N`, `M`) will remain unchanged.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, let's formulate the new state:

- If `num` was greater than `-1` in the previous iteration, `cur` would now be `num`.
- If `num` was not greater than `-1`, `num` would now be the second element of `N`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `num` from the previous iteration, we consider both cases:

**Case 1**: If `num` was greater than `-1`:
- `cur` is now `num`.
- `num` is the next element in `N`.

**Case 2**: If `num` was not greater than `-1`:
- `cur` remains `-1`.
- `num` is the second element of `N`.

However, since we need to provide a single state that covers both possibilities, we can generalize it as follows:

- `cur` will either be `-1` or the current value of `num`.
- `num` will be the next element in `N`.
- `_` remains `1`.
- `S` remains the same.
- `N` remains the same.
- `M[cur]` remains `1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cur` is `-1` or the current value of `num`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the next element in `N`, and `M[cur]` is 1**.
