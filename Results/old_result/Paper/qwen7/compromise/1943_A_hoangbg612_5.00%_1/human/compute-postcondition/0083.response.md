Output State: **`cur` is -1, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the first element of `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to -1; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Since `cur` is -1, `M[-1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
