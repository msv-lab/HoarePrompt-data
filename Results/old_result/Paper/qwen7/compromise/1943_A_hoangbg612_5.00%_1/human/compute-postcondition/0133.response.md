Output State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is `i + 1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `M` is an empty dictionary**

The code initializes `M` as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the values of `cur`, `i`, `S`, `N`, or `M`. Therefore, `cur` remains -1, `i` remains `i + 1`, `S` remains an input integer, `N` remains a sorted list of integers entered by the user, and `M` becomes an empty dictionary.
