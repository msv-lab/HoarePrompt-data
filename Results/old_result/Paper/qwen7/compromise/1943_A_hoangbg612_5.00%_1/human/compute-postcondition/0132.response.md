Output State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is `i + 1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `M` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is explicitly set to `-1`. The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1`, but since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, we keep it as `i + 1`. The variables `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
