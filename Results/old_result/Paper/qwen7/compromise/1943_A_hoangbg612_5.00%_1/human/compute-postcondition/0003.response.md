Output State: **`T` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `N`. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged.
