Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is -1, `T` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `M` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num` is an integer, `cur` is an integer, and `M[cur]` is updated based on the following conditions: if `num > cur`, then `M[cur]` is set to 1. If `num <= cur`, then `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is an integer, and `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is increased by 1 and `M[cur]` is set to 1; otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is either `num` (if `num` > 4) or 5, and `M[cur]` is either 1 or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
