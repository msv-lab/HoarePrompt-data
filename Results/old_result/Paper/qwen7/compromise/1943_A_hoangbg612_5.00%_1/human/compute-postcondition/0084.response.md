Postcondition: `cur` is `-1`, `_` is `1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the first element of `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, `M[cur]` is set to `1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is less than or equal to `-1`, then `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.
