Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is an integer greater than the current element `cur` in the list `N`, and the current value of `cur` is `cur + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since the initial value of `num` was greater than `cur + 1`, after incrementing `cur`, `num` is now greater than `cur`. The list `N` and the initial condition that `num` is greater than `cur + 1` remain unchanged.
