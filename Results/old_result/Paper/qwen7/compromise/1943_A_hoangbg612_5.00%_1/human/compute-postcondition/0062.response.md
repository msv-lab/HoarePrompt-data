Output State: The value of `i` remains 0 and `cur` remains 0 because the condition `M[i] <= i` is always true when `i` is 0, causing the loop to break immediately without incrementing `i` or changing `cur`.

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop, the value of `i` remains 0 and `cur` remains 0, as the loop breaks on the first iteration due to the condition `M[i] <= i` being satisfied when `i` is 0.
