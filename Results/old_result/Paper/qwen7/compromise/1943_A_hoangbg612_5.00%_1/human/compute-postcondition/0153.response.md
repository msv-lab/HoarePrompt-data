Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, indicating the count of occurrences of `cur`. The conditions related to `N` being a sorted list of integers with at least one element remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
