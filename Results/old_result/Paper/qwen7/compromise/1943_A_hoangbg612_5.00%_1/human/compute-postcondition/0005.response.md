Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
