Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cur` is -1
- `_` is 1
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers
- `num` is the first element of `N`

### Loop Body Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `N`. The loop body contains a condition where:
- If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num`, `M[cur]` is set to 1, and the loop breaks.
- If `num` is less than or equal to -1, then `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

### Current State:
- `cur` is -1 (unchanged from the initial state)
- `_` is 1 (unchanged from the initial state)
- `S` is an input integer (unchanged from the initial state)
- `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers (unchanged from the initial state)
- `num` is the first element of `N`

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, the next `num` should be the second element of `N`.

### Adjusted States:
- `cur` remains `-1` because the loop hasn't executed yet, so no change.
- `_` remains `1` because it is not affected by the loop.
- `S` remains the same input integer because it is not affected by the loop.
- `N` remains the same non-empty sorted list of integers because it is not modified within the loop.
- `num` changes to the second element of `N`.

### Final State:
State: **`cur` is -1, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the second element of `N`**
