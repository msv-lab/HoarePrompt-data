Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and it is the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] > i`, or it is equal to the length of `M` if no such index exists. The state of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` will remain unchanged from their final states after the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `cur` will reflect the result of the last iteration's logic, ensuring it meets the conditions described.
