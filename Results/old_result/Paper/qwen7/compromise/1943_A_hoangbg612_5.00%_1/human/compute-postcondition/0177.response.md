Output State: **`cur` is i, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**

Explanation: The code `cur = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `cur`. Since `i` was previously incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cur` now holds that incremented value of `i`. The initial condition that `cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value remains true.
