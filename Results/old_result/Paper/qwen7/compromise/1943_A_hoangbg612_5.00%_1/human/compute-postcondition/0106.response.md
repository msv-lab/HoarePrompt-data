Output State: `cur` is the largest number in the list `N`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `M[cur]` is 1.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `cur` will hold the largest number in the list `N`. This is because the loop increments `cur` to the current `num` when `num` is greater than `cur` but not more than `cur + 1`, and breaks out of the loop. If no such `num` is found (i.e., all numbers in `N` are less than or equal to `-1`), `cur` remains `-1`. The dictionary `M` will contain `cur` as a key with a value of 1, indicating that `cur` was encountered once during the loop's execution. All other variables (`S` and `N`) remain unchanged from their initial state, and `_` remains 1 as it is not affected by the loop.
