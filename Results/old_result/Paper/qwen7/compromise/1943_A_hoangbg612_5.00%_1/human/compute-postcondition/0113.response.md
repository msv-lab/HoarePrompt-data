Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`, `M` is a list of integers, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `cur`. The other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
