Output State: **`cur` remains 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers inputted by the user split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The other variables (`cur`, `_`, and `S`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `cur` remains 0, `_` is 1, `S` is still an input integer, and `N` is now a sorted list of integers inputted by the user and split by spaces and converted to integers.
