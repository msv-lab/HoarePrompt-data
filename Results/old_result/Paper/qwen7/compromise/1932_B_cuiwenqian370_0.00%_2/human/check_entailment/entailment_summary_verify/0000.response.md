### Your Response:

Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem requirements. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to process a string with `@` and `*` characters, which is unrelated to the problem of finding the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially based on their periodicities.

The original assessment suggested a corrected version of the program that uses the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the year in which all signs will occur. Let's verify if the provided solution indeed solves the problem correctly.

The corrected program provided in the original assessment is as follows:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    return reduce(lcm, periods)

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        path = data[2]
        periods = list(map(int, path.split()))
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

Let's break down the logic:
1. **lcm Function**: This function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).
2. **find_apocalypse_year Function**: This function uses the `reduce` function to apply the `lcm` function across all elements in the list of periodicities, effectively finding the LCM of all periodicities.
3. **func_2 Function**: This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `find_apocalypse_year` to get the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided example, this solution correctly computes the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the provided solution is correct.

Final: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
