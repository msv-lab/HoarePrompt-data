Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of characters `path` as input and uses dynamic programming to calculate the year when the nth sign will occur.
   - The function correctly handles the initialization of the `dp` array based on the first character of `path`.
   - The logic for updating the `dp` array is correct, considering both `@` and `*` characters appropriately.
   - The final return statement correctly finds the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than `-inf`, ensuring the correct year is returned.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input, extracts the necessary parameters for each test case, and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed correctly.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Function 1 correctly calculates the year for the nth sign to occur, and Function 2 correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
