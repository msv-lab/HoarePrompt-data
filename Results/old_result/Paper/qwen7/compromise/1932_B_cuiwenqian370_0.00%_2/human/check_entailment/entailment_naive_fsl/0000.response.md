Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year in which all \(n\) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, based on their periodicities. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address this requirement at all. Instead, they seem to be related to processing a string with `@` and `*` characters, which is completely unrelated to the problem statement.

To solve the given problem, the program should calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities \(a_i\). The LCM will give the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    return reduce(lcm, periods)

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        path = data[2]
        periods = list(map(int, path.split()))
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected program calculates the LCM of the periodicities for each test case and prints the result. This approach ensures that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
