Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of characters. It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` to keep track of certain values based on the characters in `path`. Depending on the first character of `path`, `dp[0]` is set to either 1 or `-inf`. For subsequent characters, `dp[i]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if the current character is '@', or just the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` if the current character is '*'. Finally, the function returns 0 if no valid value in `dp` is greater than `-inf`, otherwise it returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than `-inf`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. The next line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.

    #State: Output State: `t` is the number of iterations in the loop, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `t + 2`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of calling `func_1` with a path string from the `data` list, the loop has executed all iterations, and the output consists of printing each element in the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of data. Each group includes an integer `n` indicating the number of signs, and `n` space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs. For each group, it calls `func_1` with a path string and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result from the collected list.
