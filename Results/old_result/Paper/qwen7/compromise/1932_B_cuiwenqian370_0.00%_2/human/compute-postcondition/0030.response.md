Output State: **dp is a list of length n where each dp[i] (for 0 ≤ i < n) is calculated based on the previous elements in dp and the characters in path. Specifically, dp[0] is 1 or -inf depending on path[0], dp[1] is dp[0] + 1 if path[1] == '@' or dp[0] if path[1] == '*', and for each i from 2 to n-1, dp[i] is the maximum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] plus 1 if path[i] == '@', otherwise it's just the maximum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2]. t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and n is greater than 1 with each a_i being an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**
