Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `-inf` and all other elements are 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, and `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `path[0]` is '*', `path[0]` is not '@'.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[0]` to `-float('inf')`, which is represented as `-inf` in the output state. All other elements in the list `dp` remain 0, as only the first element was modified. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_i`, `path[0]`) retain their original conditions and values.
