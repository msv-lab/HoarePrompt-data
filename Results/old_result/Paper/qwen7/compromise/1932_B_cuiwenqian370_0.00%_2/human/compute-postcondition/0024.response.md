Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n` where either the first element is 1 and all other elements are 0, or the first element is `-inf` and all other elements are 0; `dp[1]` is either `dp[0] + 1` if `path[1] == '@'` or `dp[0]` if `path[1] == '*'`; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 1; `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `path[0]` is either '@' or '*'; `path[1]` is not '*'.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[1]` based on the value of `path[1]`. If `path[1]` is '@', then `dp[1]` is set to `dp[0] + 1`. If `path[1]` is '*', then `dp[1]` is set to `dp[0]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
