Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not read the input array `a` correctly and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as described. Instead, it hardcodes the output for specific lengths of the array without actually processing the input. This means it will not work for general cases where the input array length is different from 2 or 1. For example, if the input is:

```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The program will output:

```
13 0
```

which is incorrect because the maximum sum can be achieved by setting all elements to 100, resulting in a sum of 400. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
