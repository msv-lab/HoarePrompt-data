Reasoning:
- The problem requires a solution that maximizes the sum of the elements of the array \(a\) through a series of operations. Each operation involves setting a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
- The provided code does not implement the logic to find the MEX for any subarray or perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array.
- Instead, the code simply prints hardcoded values based on the length of the input array without performing any required operations.
- For \(n = 2\), the code prints "4 1" and "1 2", which is incorrect because for the input "0 1", the correct output should be "2 1" with the operation "1 2".
- For \(n > 2\), the code prints "13 0", which is also incorrect because the MEX operation could potentially increase the sum of the array, and the code does not perform these operations.

Given that the code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem, it cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
