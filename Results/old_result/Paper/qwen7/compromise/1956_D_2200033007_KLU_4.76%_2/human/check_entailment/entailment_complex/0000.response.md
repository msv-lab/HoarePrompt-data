Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in the array using up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the input array `a` and does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
3. The function `func_1` simply checks if the length of the input list `c` is 2. If it is, it prints "4 1" and "1 2", indicating a specific case for an array of length 2. Otherwise, it prints "13 0" without performing any operations.
4. This behavior does not align with the problem requirements, as it does not attempt to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct for solving the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
