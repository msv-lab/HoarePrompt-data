### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 0 \)
     - Since no bridges can be destroyed, all islands are reachable.
     - Expected output: 2 (both islands are reachable).
   - **Case 2**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - One bridge can be destroyed, preventing access to one island.
     - Expected output: 1 (only island 1 is reachable).
   - **Case 3**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - One bridge can be destroyed, but it's not enough to isolate more than one island.
     - Expected output: 4 (all islands are reachable).
   - **Case 4**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 10 \)
     - Since \( k \geq \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2} \), all bridges can be destroyed, isolating island 1.
     - Expected output: 1 (only island 1 is reachable).
   - **Case 5**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 3 \)
     - Three bridges can be destroyed, but not enough to isolate all islands except 1.
     - Expected output: 5 (all islands are reachable).
   - **Case 6**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 4 \)
     - All bridges can be destroyed, isolating island 1.
     - Expected output: 1 (only island 1 is reachable).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \), it prints 1 (isolating island 1).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( n - 1 \) (all other islands are reachable).

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the condition where `k` is large enough to isolate island 1.
   - The logic also correctly handles the case where `k` is insufficient to isolate all but one island.

Given the analysis and verification, the provided program correctly implements the solution.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
