Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its previous value, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` updates the value of `c` by adding the value of `ele` to its current value. The other variables (`maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
