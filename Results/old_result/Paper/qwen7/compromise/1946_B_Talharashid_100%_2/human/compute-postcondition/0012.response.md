Output State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is a non-negative integer, `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`, and `c` is now `c + ele`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. Since `ele` is a non-negative integer, `c` becomes `c + ele`. The conditions for `l`, `ele`, and the relationship between `c` and `abs(ele)` remain unchanged.
