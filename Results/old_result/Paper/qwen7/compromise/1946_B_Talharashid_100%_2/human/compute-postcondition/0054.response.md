Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `ele` from the list `l`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
   - `c` is updated based on the previous iteration.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is the second integer input.
   - `l` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is the current element being processed in the list `l`, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must still contain at least one element.
   - `maxi` remains unchanged because it is determined after the loop completes.
   - `c` remains unchanged because it is updated inside the loop based on the current `ele`.
   - `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `l` must have at least one element remaining for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` is updated based on the previous iteration, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining.**
