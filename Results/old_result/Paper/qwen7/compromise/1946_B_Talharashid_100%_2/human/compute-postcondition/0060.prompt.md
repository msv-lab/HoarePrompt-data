Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `maxi` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input from the user, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, `c` is updated to either `c + ele` if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` is updated based on the previous iteration, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is updated to `abs(ele)`. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `maxi`, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its previous value if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains the same as the original `maxi` and `c` is 0. `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
