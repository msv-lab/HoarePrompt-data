Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in l:`. The only variable involved here is `ele`, which iterates over the elements of the list `l`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ele`**: Since the loop starts with the first element of the list `l`, `ele` will be set to the first element of `l` during the first iteration.

3. **Adjust the State of `l`**: For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element. If `l` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `maxi`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the list `l` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`l` must have at least one integer element**
