You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The array a is a list of integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the array.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = 0
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `maxi` will hold the maximum value of `c` across all test cases, `c` will be 0 (as it is reset to 0 after processing each test case), `i` will be equal to `t` (indicating all test cases have been processed), `n` will be the last `n` value inputted, `k` will be the last `k` value inputted, and `l` will be an empty list since all elements have been processed.
    #
    #This means that `maxi` captures the highest accumulated value of `c` across all test cases, considering the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `c` resets to 0 after each test case, `i` increments with each iteration until it equals `t`, and `n` and `k` retain their last input values from the final test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) such that the sum of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and an array a of integers (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function processes the values of t, n, k, and the array a to produce a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
