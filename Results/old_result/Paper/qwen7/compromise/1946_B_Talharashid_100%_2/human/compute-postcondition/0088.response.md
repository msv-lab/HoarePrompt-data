Output State: **`ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is `13 + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of `13 + ele` and `13`**.

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` (which is `13 + ele`) and the current `maxi` (which is `13`). Since the exact value of `ele` is not specified, `c` remains as `13 + ele`. The output state reflects that `maxi` is now the larger of the two values, `13 + ele` and `13`.
