Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `maxi` will hold the maximum value of `c` across all test cases, `c` will be 0 (as it is reset to 0 after processing each test case), `i` will be equal to `t` (indicating all test cases have been processed), `n` will be the last `n` value inputted, `k` will be the last `k` value inputted, and `l` will be an empty list since all elements have been processed.

This means that `maxi` captures the highest accumulated value of `c` across all test cases, considering the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `c` resets to 0 after each test case, `i` increments with each iteration until it equals `t`, and `n` and `k` retain their last input values from the final test case.
