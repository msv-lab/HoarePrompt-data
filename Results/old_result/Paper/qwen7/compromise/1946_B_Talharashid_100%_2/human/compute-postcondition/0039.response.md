Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each element (`ele`) in the list `l`. Therefore, the relevant objects in the loop head are `ele`, `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `maxi` is currently set to 0.
   - `c` is currently set to 0.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `n` is the first integer input from the user.
   - `k` is the second integer input from the user.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute, `l` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust the values of `maxi` or `c`.
   - We need to ensure that `l` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `l` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`maxi` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
