Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) such that the sum of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and an array a of integers (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function processes the values of t, n, k, and the array a to produce a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and an array, and it processes these inputs to generate a result for each test case without needing to be explicitly called with parameters each time.
