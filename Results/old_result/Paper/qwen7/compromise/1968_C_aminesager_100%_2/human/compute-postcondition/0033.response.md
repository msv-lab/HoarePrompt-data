Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`, where `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list with `n` elements.
   - Each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

2. **Understanding the Elements of `a`:**
   - For `j = 0`, `a[0]` is `T[0] + T[0] = 2 * T[0]`.
   - For `j = 1`, `a[1]` is `(T[0] + T[1]) + (2 * T[0]) = 3 * T[0] + T[1]`.
   - For `j = 2`, `a[2]` is `(T[0] + T[1] + T[2]) + (3 * T[0] + T[1]) = 4 * T[0] + 2 * T[1] + T[2]`.
   - And so on...

3. **Formulating the General Element of `a`:**
   - The general formula for `a[j]` is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`.
   - Since `a[0] = 2 * T[0]`, the formula becomes: `a[j] = (j+1) * T[0] + Î£(T[k] for k in range(1, j+1))`.

4. **Result String Construction:**
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
   - Therefore, `result` will be a string like `"2*T[0] 3*T[0]+T[1] 4*T[0]+2*T[1]+T[2] ..."`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement `print(result)` will output the string `result` which contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, the output will be a string representation of the list `a` with elements separated by spaces, where each element is constructed according to the given formula.

Output: **"2*T[0] 3*T[0]+T[1] 4*T[0]+2*T[1]+T[2] ... n*T[0]+(n-1)*T[1]+...+T[n-1]"**
