Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is the string input by the user.**

The code `line = input('')` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
