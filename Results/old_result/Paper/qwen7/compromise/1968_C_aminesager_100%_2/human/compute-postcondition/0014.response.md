Output State: `a` will contain the integers from 1000 up to the sum of the first `n-1` elements of the list `T`. The length of `a` will be `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will start with the initial value of 1000 and each subsequent element will be the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T` (shifted by one index). This process continues until the loop has iterated `n-1` times, resulting in a list `a` of length `n` where the last element is the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T` starting from 1000.
