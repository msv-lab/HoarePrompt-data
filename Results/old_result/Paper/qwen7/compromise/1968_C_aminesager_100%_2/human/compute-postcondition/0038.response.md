Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t-1` and is still truthy (non-zero), `line` is the input entered by the user, `T` is a list of integers created by splitting the input `line` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` takes the input `line`, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `T`. All other variables remain unchanged.
