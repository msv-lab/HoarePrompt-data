Output State: **`a` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
