Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the only sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the last sublist in `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `last_row` by adding the last element of the last sublist in `a`. Since `a` contains only one sublist, `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of that single sublist. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, and `first_row`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
