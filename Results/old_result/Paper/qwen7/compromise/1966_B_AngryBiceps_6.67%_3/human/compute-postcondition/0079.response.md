Output State: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with `n` elements, each being an input from the user; `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each sublist in `a` concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each sublist in `a` concatenated together, with each subsequent character being added to the previous one.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be the total number of inputs received, `i` will be `n + 1` (since `i` starts at `n` and increments with each iteration but does not reach `n`), `a` will be a list of `n` strings, each representing an input from the user, `first_row` will be a string made up of the first character from each of these inputs, and `last_row` will be a string made up of the last character from each of these inputs, with each character in `last_row` being the sum of the corresponding characters from the end of each input string in `a`.
