Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is now `n+1`, `m` is an integer input from the user, `i` is `n+1`, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the only sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the last sublist in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the second sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the second sublist in `a` and then incrementing it by the last element of the last sublist in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the inputs from the user and the third element is the latest input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the second sublist in `a` and then adding the first element of the last sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the second sublist in `a` and then incrementing it by the last element of the last sublist in `a`; `last_row` is increased by the last element of the last sublist in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
