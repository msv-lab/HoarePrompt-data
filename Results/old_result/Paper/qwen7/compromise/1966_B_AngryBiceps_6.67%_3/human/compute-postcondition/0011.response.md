Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the first element in list `a` and the first element of the second element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the second element in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding the first element of the last sublist (`a[-1][0]`) to its current value. Since `first_row` was initially the first element of the first sublist (`a[0][0]`), after the operation, `first_row` becomes `a[0][0] + a[1][0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
