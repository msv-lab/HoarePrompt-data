Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list containing all the inputs provided by the user up to the `n-1`th iteration; `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each sublist in `a`, concatenated in the order they appear in `a`; `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each sublist in `a`, concatenated in the order they appear in `a`, with each subsequent character being the sum (concatenation) of the last characters of the corresponding sublists in `a`. If the first element of `a` is a string with all characters the same and the last element of `a` is different from the first element of `a`, then the first element of `a[0]` is not composed of a single unique character, or `a[0]` is equal to the last element `a[-1]`. Otherwise, the first element of `a[0]` is composed of a single unique character, or `a[0]` is not equal to the last element `a[-1]`.**
