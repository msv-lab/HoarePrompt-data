Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user.
   - `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the first element in list `a` and the first element of the second element in list `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last element of the second element in list `a` plus the last element of the last element in list `a`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the values for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

6. **Note about other variables**: The other variables (`a`, `first_row`, `last_row`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**
