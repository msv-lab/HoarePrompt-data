Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with three elements where the first element is an input from the user, the second element is another input from the user, and the third element is a new input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the only element in the list `a` and the first element of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in the list `a` plus the last element of the last element in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new input from the user to the list `a`. Initially, `a` had two elements: the first element was an input from the user, and the second element was another input from the user. After appending a new input, `a` now has three elements. The values of `i`, `n`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
