Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the first sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the second sublist in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends another input from the user to the list `a`. Initially, `a` had one element which was an input from the user. After appending another input, `a` now contains two elements. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and `first_row` and `last_row` are updated based on the new structure of `a`.
