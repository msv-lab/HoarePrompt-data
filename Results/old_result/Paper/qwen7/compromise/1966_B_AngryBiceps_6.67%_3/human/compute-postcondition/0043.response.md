Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the only element in the list `a` and the first element of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in the list `a` plus the last element of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments `last_row` by the value of the last element of the last element in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list with two elements, and each element is a list, `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of the last list in `a`. The value of `last_row` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
