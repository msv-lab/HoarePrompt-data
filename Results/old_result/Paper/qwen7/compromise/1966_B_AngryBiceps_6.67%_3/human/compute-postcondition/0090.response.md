Output State: **All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the final state of the variables is as follows:**

- `n` is the number of rows in the grid for the current test case.
- `m` is the number of columns in the grid for the current test case.
- `a` is a list containing `n` strings, each representing a row of the grid.
- `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each row in the grid.
- `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each row in the grid.
- After processing all test cases, the loop has executed `int(input())` times, where `input()` represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the program checks the conditions:
  - If the first row is uniform (all characters the same) but different from the last row, it prints 'NO'.
  - If the first character of each row forms a uniform string (all characters the same) but is different from the last character of each row, it prints 'NO'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The loop ensures that all test cases are processed, and the output for each test case is determined based on the specified conditions.
