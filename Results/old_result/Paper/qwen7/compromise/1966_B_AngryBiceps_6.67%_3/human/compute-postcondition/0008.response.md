Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` updates the value of `last_row` by adding the last element of the last element in the list `a` to its current value. Since `a` is a list with one element, which is itself a list (let's say `[x]`), `a[-1]` refers to `[x]` and `a[-1][-1]` refers to `x`. Therefore, `last_row` is updated to be `last_row + x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
