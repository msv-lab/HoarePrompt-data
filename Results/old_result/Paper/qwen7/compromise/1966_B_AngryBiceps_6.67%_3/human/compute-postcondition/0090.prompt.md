Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input from the user, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each input string in the list `a`, and `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each input string in the list `a`. The first element of the list `a` is either a string with all identical characters and not equal to the last element of the list `a`, or a string not composed of a single character, and either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a` repeated according to its position in the list, and either (1) the first element of `a` consists of only one unique character while the last element of `a` is different from the first element of `a`, or (2) the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, or (3) the set of characters in `first_row` is not a singleton set, or (4) `first_row` is equal to `last_row`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list containing all the inputs provided by the user up to the `n-1`th iteration; `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each sublist in `a`, concatenated in the order they appear in `a`; `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each sublist in `a`, concatenated in the order they appear in `a`, with each subsequent character being the sum (concatenation) of the last characters of the corresponding sublists in `a`. If the first element of `a` is a string with all characters the same and the last element of `a` is different from the first element of `a`, then the first element of `a[0]` is not composed of a single unique character, or `a[0]` is equal to the last element `a[-1]`. Otherwise, the first element of `a[0]` is composed of a single unique character, or `a[0]` is not equal to the last element `a[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
