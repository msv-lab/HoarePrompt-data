t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string containing m characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white square and 'B' represents a black square. The sum of n⋅m over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
