Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The program checks only two specific conditions (whether the first row and the last row are the same and whether the first and last elements of each row are the same), which are insufficient to determine the possibility of making all squares the same color.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
BBW
BWB
WBB
```

According to the problem description, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the following operations:
1. Select positions (1, 1) and (3, 3) to color the subrectangle from (1, 1) to (3, 3) to 'B'.
2. Select positions (1, 3) and (3, 1) to color the subrectangle from (1, 1) to (3, 3) to 'B'.

However, the provided program would incorrectly output "NO" because the first and last elements of each row are not the same, and the first row and the last row are not the same.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
