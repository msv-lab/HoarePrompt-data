Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged, and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `D[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `D[in_aa]` by 1. According to the initial postcondition, if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` would be decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` would be decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` would be increased by 1. However, since the code only modifies `D[in_aa]`, none of these conditions are met, and therefore, `D[out_aa]`, `pairs_in_D`, and `C[out_aa]` remain unchanged.
