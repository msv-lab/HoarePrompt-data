Output State: **`fnd` is `fnd + 1` if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` else `fnd` remains 0, all other variables retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The line `fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0` checks if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, `fnd` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. No other variables are affected by this line of code.
