Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1**.

This means that `D[out_aa]` has been decreased by 1, `D[in_aa]` has been increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` has been increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` has not changed, and `C[in_aa]` has been decreased by 1 due to the execution of the code.
