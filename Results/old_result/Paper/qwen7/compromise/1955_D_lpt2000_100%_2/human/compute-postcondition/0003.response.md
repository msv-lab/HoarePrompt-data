Output State: **`nabors` is a list of strings converted from the input split by spaces, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to a string, and assigns the resulting list of strings to `aa`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
