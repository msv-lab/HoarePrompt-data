Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1. The initial state shows that `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, which remain unchanged in terms of their relationship to each other and their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `C[out_aa]`.
