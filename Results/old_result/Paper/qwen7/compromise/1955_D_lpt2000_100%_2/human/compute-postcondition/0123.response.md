Postcondition: `in_aa` and `out_aa` are indices. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `D[out_aa]`, `pairs_in_D`, and `C[out_aa]` remain unchanged.
