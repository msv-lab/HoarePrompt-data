Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `fnd` is 0, `D` is an empty list, `E` is an empty list, `C` is an empty list, `pairs_in_D` is 0, `in_aa` is undefined, `out_aa` is undefined, `bb` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `aa` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`.**

The code `cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])` creates a `Counter` object named `cnt_aa` that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of the list `aa`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
