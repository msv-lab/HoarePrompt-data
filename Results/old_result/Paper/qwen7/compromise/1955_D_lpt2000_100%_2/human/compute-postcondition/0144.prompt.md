Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `C` is a Counter object representing `cnt_bb` minus `D`; `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `fnd` is 1 if the number of items in `D` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing `cnt_aa` minus `D`, `in_aa` is undefined, `out_aa` is undefined, `bb` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `aa` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is `fnd + 1` if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` else `fnd` remains 0, all other variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 (if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, it is further decreased by 1); `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 (if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0); `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1 (if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0) or decreased by 1 (otherwise); `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
