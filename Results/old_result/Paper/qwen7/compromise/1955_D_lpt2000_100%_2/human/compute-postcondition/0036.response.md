Postcondition: `aa` is a list such that `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least one element. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and becomes greater than the previous value, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to the previous value minus 1, `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged, and `E[in_aa]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.
