Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code converts the input strings to lists of strings instead of integers. This is incorrect because the input consists of integers, not strings.
2. **Counter Usage**: The `Counter` objects are created from lists of strings, which means they will count occurrences of string representations of numbers, not the actual integer values.
3. **Logic Errors**: The logic for updating the counters and checking conditions is flawed. Specifically, the way the counters are updated and the condition checks do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        aa = list(map(int, input().split()))
        bb = list(map(int, input().split()))

        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        E = cnt_aa - D
        C = cnt_bb - D
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0

        for i in range(m, n):
            out_aa = aa[i - m]
            in_aa = aa[i]

            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                D[in_aa] += 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
                C[in_aa] -= 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0

        print(fnd)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the integer inputs and correctly updates the counters and checks the conditions to determine if the subsegments are good.
