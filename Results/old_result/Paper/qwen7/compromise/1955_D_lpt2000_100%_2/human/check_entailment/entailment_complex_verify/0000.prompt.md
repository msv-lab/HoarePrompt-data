You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in the final state of the variables as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a list \( b \) of \( m \) integers. For each test case, it calculates whether the number of pairs of elements from \( a \) and \( b \) that match (i.e., are in both lists) meets or exceeds \( k \). If the condition is met, it increments a counter; otherwise, it does not. After processing all test cases, it prints the total count of such test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of good subsegments. Specifically, the logic for updating the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` is flawed. Here’s an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
7 4 2
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
```

The expected output is 4, as all subsegments of length 4 are good. However, the provided code does not correctly update the counters to reflect the changes in the subsegments. For instance, when processing the subsegment `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the code should correctly identify that it is good, but the subsequent updates to the counters might not accurately reflect this, leading to incorrect counts for subsequent subsegments.

To fix this, the code needs to properly handle the addition and removal of elements from the counters as the subsegment slides through the array `a`. The current implementation may miss some valid subsegments or incorrectly count others, leading to an incorrect result.
