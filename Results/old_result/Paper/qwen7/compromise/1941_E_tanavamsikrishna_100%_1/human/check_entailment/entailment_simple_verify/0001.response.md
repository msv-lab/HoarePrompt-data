### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the given problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1`

1. **Initialization:**
   - The first support cost is set to 1.
   - For the first `d` cells, each cell's value is incremented by 2. This ensures that the first and last supports are placed correctly and the distance constraint is maintained for the first few cells.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min heap is created from the first `d` cells, which helps in efficiently finding the minimum cost up to a certain distance.

3. **Processing Remaining Cells:**
   - For each subsequent cell, the heap is used to find the minimum cost from the previous cells that satisfy the distance constraint (`i - (d + 2)`).
   - The current cell's cost is updated to the minimum cost found plus the current cell's value plus 1.
   - The updated cost and index are pushed back into the heap.

4. **Return the Last Cost:**
   - The cost of the last cell is returned, which represents the minimum cost to install supports in the row.

#### Function `func_2`

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are read from the input.
   - The river grid `rows` is read and stored as a list of lists.

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Row:**
   - For each row, the minimum cost to install supports is calculated using `func_1`.

3. **Calculate Total Costs for Consecutive Rows:**
   - The costs for each row are summed up in groups of `k` consecutive rows.
   - The minimum total cost for any `k` consecutive rows is found.

4. **Output the Minimum Cost:**
   - The minimum total cost is printed.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Heap Usage:**
   - The heap is used efficiently to keep track of the minimum cost up to a certain distance, ensuring the distance constraint is maintained.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation logic in `func_1` correctly ensures that the distance between supports is no more than `d` and minimizes the overall cost.

3. **Consecutive Rows:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly iterates through the rows and finds the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as the first and last cells being fixed at 0 and the distance constraint being enforced.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the program, the logic implemented in both functions appears to be correct and follows the problem constraints accurately. The heap-based approach ensures that the distance constraint is maintained, and the cost calculation logic correctly minimizes the total cost.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
