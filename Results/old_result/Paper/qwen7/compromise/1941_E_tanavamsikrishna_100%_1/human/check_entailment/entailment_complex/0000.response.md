Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly initializes the first few elements of the `row` list to ensure there is a support in the first and last columns.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest values in the current window of size `d` and updates the elements accordingly.
   - The logic ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly processes the input to get the dimensions and the river grid.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to calculate the cost of placing supports.
   - It then computes the total cost for each possible segment of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost among these segments.
   - The logic is sound and follows the problem constraints.

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, both functions work correctly to solve the problem as described. There are no logical errors or omissions in either function.

Correctness: **True**
