### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`

1. **Initialization:**
   - The first support cost is set to 1.
   - The first `d` cells are incremented by 2, ensuring the first and last cells remain 0.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min-heap is created from the first `d` cells, which helps in efficiently finding the minimum cost up to a certain distance.

3. **Processing Remaining Cells:**
   - For each subsequent cell, the heap is used to ensure that the distance between any two supports is no more than `d`.
   - The cost of each cell is updated to include the minimum cost found in the heap plus the current cell's value plus 1.
   - The updated cost and index are pushed back into the heap.

4. **Return the Last Cost:**
   - The last element of the updated `row` is returned, representing the minimum cost to install supports in the row.

#### Function `func_2`

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - Read the river grid `rows`.

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Row:**
   - Use `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each row.

3. **Calculate Total Costs for Consecutive Rows:**
   - Iterate through the calculated costs and find the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Output the Minimum Cost:**
   - Print the minimum total cost.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Heap Usage:**
   - The heap is used to efficiently manage the minimum cost up to a certain distance, ensuring the distance constraint is maintained.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation logic in `func_1` correctly ensures that the distance between supports is no more than `d` and minimizes the overall cost.

3. **Consecutive Rows:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly iterates through the rows and finds the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as the first and last cells being fixed at 0 and the distance constraint being enforced.

### Key Points

- The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the distance constraint is maintained efficiently.
- The cost calculation in `func_1` correctly updates each cell to include the minimum cost found in the heap plus the current cell's value plus 1.
- The iteration in `func_2` correctly finds the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program, the logic implemented in both functions is correct and follows the problem constraints accurately. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
