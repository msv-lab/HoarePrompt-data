Output State: **row[i] is updated to e[0] + row[i] + 1, and the conditions i <= d + 2 and e[1] <= i - (d + 2) are still valid; min_heap contains the tuple (e[0], e[1])**.

Explanation: The code `heappush(min_heap, e)` adds the tuple `e` to the `min_heap`. Since `e` is a tuple, it is added as a single element to the heap. The values of `row[i]`, `d`, and the conditions `i <= d + 2` and `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` remain unchanged from the initial state.
