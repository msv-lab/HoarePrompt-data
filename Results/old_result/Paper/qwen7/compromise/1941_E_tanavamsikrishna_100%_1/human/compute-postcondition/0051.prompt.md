You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: Output State: `row` is a list of integers starting with 1, followed by elements each incremented by 2 up to the value of `d` minus one; `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3; `i` is `d-1`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `row` list will start with 1, and each subsequent element will be 2 more than the previous one, up to the length of the list determined by `d`. The value of `d` must be at least 3 for the loop to run at least three times, and `i` will be set to `d-1` after the loop completes.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches the length of `row`. At this point, `i` will be equal to `len(row)`, and `min_heap` will contain tuples where each tuple consists of an updated value of `row[i]` and the corresponding index `i`. Each element in `row` from index `d` to the end will be updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, where `e[0]` is the smallest value popped from `min_heap` during the execution of the loop. The `min_heap` will reflect these updates, ensuring that the smallest value in `min_heap` is always the smallest updated value in `row` from the current `i` to the end of the list.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which has been updated such that each element from index `d` to the end is incremented by the smallest value found in `min_heap` plus one.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `row`, a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells, and `d`, a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between supports. The function returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated such that each element from index `d` to the end is incremented by the smallest value found in `min_heap` plus one.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which has been updated such that each element from index `d` to the end is incremented by the smallest value found in `min_heap` plus one.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
