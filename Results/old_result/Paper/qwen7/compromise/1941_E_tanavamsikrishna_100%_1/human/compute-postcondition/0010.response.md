Output State: `total_costs` is now a list containing the sum of every consecutive `k` elements of `costs`. Specifically, it will contain `sum(costs[0:k])`, `sum(costs[1:k+1])`, ..., `sum(costs[len(costs)-k:len(costs)])`. The `rows`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `costs` retain their original values; `i` is now equal to `len(costs) - k`.

This means that `total_costs` will have as many elements as there are possible consecutive sublists of length `k` in `costs`, which is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Each element in `total_costs` represents the sum of a consecutive sublist of `k` elements from `costs`.
