Functionality: **The function accepts four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of \( n \) lists called `rows`. It calculates the sum of every consecutive \( k \) elements from a list `costs`, which is derived from `rows` using `func_1(row, d)` for each row. Finally, it prints the minimum value from the list `total_costs`, which contains these sums. The function does not return any value.**
