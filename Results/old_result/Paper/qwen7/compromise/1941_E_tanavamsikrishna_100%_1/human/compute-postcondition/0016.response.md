Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   ```python
   while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
   ```
   This means that the loop continues as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `i` must be at least `2d + 2`.
   - The minimum value in `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `-2`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(e[1] := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true. 

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - **`i`**: The value of `i` must be such that the loop can continue. Since the loop pops an element from `min_heap` and checks its value against `i - (d + 2)`, `i` should be adjusted to ensure that the condition holds true after popping another element.
   - **Minimum Value in `min_heap`**: The minimum value in `min_heap` must still be less than or equal to `-2` for the loop to continue.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again:**
   - After popping an element from `min_heap`, the new minimum value in `min_heap` must still be less than or equal to `-2`.
   - The value of `i` must be adjusted such that even after the next pop, the condition `(e[1] := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` remains true.

### Adjusted States

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `i` and ensure the minimum value in `min_heap` is still valid.

- **`i`**: The value of `i` should be adjusted to ensure that even after the next pop, the condition holds. Since the minimum value in `min_heap` is currently less than or equal to `-2`, the next value popped will also be less than or equal to `-2`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to ensure that the next value popped is still less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
- **Minimum Value in `min_heap`**: It must remain less than or equal to `-2`.

Given that the current minimum value in `min_heap` is `-2`, the next value popped will also be less than or equal to `-2`. Thus, `i` should be adjusted to ensure the condition holds for the next iteration.

### Final Answer

State: **`i` must be at least `2d + 2` and the minimum value in `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `-2`**.

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time.
