Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`.
   - `rows` is unchanged.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values.
   - `d` retains its original value.
   - `costs` is unchanged.
   - `i` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - All other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`; `rows` is unchanged, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is unchanged; `i` is 1**.
