Output State: **`min_heap` contains the tuple `(e[0] + row[i] + 1, i)`; the conditions `i <= d + 2` and `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` are still valid.**

Explanation: The code `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))` pushes a new tuple into the `min_heap`. Given that `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, the new tuple added to `min_heap` is `(e[0] + row[i] + 1, i)`. The conditions `i <= d + 2` and `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` remain valid as they were not affected by the heap push operation.
