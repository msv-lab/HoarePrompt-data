Output State: **`total_costs` now contains the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` plus the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from the element at index `i`, which is 3, and `rows`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `costs` retain their original values, `i` is now 4.**

Explanation: The code appends to `total_costs` the sum of the slice of `costs` starting from index `i` (which is 3) and ending at index `i + k`. This means that `total_costs` now includes the sum of the elements from index 3 to index `3 + k - 1`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`, which is 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
