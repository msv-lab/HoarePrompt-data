Output State: **`i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` contains values including `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`, `row[i-1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`, and the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `d + 1`.**

Explanation: The `pass` statement does nothing and does not affect any of the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, all the conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.
