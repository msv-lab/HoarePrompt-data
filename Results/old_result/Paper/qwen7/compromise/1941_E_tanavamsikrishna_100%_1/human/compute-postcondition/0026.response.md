Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   ```python
   while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
   ```
   This means the loop continues as long as the second element (index 1) of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `i` is `2d + 3`.
   - `min_heap` contains values where the minimum is less than or equal to `-2` and now includes `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`.
   - `row[i-1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head involves two variables: `e[1]` (the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap`) and `i`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   For the loop to continue, `e[1]` (the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap`) must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. 

5. **Update the State:**
   - Since `i` is `2d + 3`, the expression `i - (d + 2)` simplifies to:
     \[
     i - (d + 2) = (2d + 3) - (d + 2) = d + 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the loop will continue if the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `d + 1`.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `d + 1`.
   - Given that the current minimum in `min_heap` is less than or equal to `-2`, and the new tuple added to `min_heap` has the form `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`, we need to ensure that this new tuple does not violate the loop condition.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `d + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

**State:**
- `i` is `2d + 3`.
- `min_heap` contains values where the minimum is less than or equal to `-2` and now includes `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`.
- `row[i-1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`.
- The second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `d + 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` contains values where the minimum is less than or equal to `-2` and now includes `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`, `row[i-1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`, and the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `d + 1`**.
