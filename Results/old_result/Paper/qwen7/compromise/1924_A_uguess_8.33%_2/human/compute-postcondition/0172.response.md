Output State: **`ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'b', and `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` updates the value of `tmp` to be the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the current value of `i`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `tmp` was set to `'a'`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, `tmp` is now set to `'b'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
