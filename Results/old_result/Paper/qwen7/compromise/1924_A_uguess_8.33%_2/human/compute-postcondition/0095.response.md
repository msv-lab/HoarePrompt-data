Output State: **All characters in the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\), and `i` is \(k-1\).**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every character in the string `s` would have been processed once. The variable `cur` is reset to 0 at the end of each full cycle through the string, and `cnt` keeps track of how many times `cur` reached the value \((1 << k) - 1\), indicating that all bits up to the `k`-th bit were set. The variable `i` remains \(k-1\) as it is not modified within the loop.
