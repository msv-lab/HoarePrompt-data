Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is `cur + 2^cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur` by adding `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` bits to it. Here, `1 << cur_ss` means `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`. Since `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `cur` is updated to its original value plus `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
