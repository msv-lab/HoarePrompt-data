Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is updated such that if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` (where `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a') is not set in `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + 2^cur_ss`. If the bit is already set, no change is made to `cur`; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The values of `s`, `ss`, and `cur` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
