Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers entered by the user, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`. If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to `cur` and `cnt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 1, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cur` remains unchanged; otherwise, `cur` is updated to the original value of `cur` plus 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))}\), `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 2, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is incremented by \(2^{cur_ss}\); otherwise, the values of `cur`, `cnt`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged. If `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\), then `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `cur_ss` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
