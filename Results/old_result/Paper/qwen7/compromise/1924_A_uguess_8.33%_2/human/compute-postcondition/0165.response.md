Output State: **`ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a' + \(2k-1\), and `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a' + (2k-1)` to the variable `tmp`. Since `i` is \(2k-1\), `tmp` is set to the character `'a' + (2k-1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
