Postcondition: **All characters in the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\), and `i` is \(k-1\). If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `i` remains `k-1`, `cur` remains 0, and `cnt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` becomes \(2k-1\), `cur` becomes 0, `tmp` becomes an empty string, `cnt` becomes 0, and `ans` becomes `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`.**
