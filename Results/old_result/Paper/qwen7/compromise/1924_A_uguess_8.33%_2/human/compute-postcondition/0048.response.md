Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `cur` is an integer where the bit at position `i` is not set
   - `tmp` is 'a'

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **Checking the Bit Condition:**
   - Since `i` is now 1, we need to ensure that `cur` still meets the condition of having the bit at position `i` (which is now 1) not set.
   - This means `cur & (1 << 1)` should be 0.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `cur` must still have the bit at position 1 not set.
   - `tmp` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `cur` is an integer where the bit at position 1 is not set, and `tmp` is 'a'**
