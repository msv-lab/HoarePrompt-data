Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ss` from the range function applied to `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `s` to iterate over.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`. If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to `cur` and `cnt` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on the elements of `s`, `ss` will be the next element in `s`.
   - No changes are made to `cur` or `cnt` unless `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\). Therefore, these values remain the same for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are the values of `ss`, which will be the next element in `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cnt` is the current value of `cnt`, and `ss` is the next element in `s`**.
