Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `cur = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `cur`. Since `cur` was previously calculated based on the condition involving `ss`, assigning it 0 resets its value. Additionally, the `cnt` variable is incremented by 1 in the initial state, so it becomes 1 after executing the code. The values of `s` and `ss` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
