Output State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))}\), `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 2, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is checked, and if it is 0, `cur` is incremented by \(2^{cur_ss}\); otherwise, the values of `cur`, `cnt`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged. `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`.**

This means that the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `cur` and `cur_ss` remain as per their postconditions, and the bit check and potential increment for `cur` based on the bit's value remains the same.
