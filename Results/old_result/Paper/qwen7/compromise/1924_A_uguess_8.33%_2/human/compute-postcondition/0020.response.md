Output State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cnt` is the current value of `cnt`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `ss` is the next element in `s`. `cur` is now the original value of `cur` plus 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the value `1` left by `cur_ss` positions and adds it to `cur`. This means `cur` is updated to its original value plus \(2^{cur_ss}\). The values of `cnt`, `cur_ss`, and `ss` remain unchanged.
