Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to \(k-1\).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop condition depends on `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is within the range `[0, k-1]` for the loop to execute correctly.

Given the initial state where `i` is \(k-1\), the loop will execute once because `i` will be decremented in each iteration until it reaches 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is valid for the loop to execute.

**State Adjustment**:
- The initial value of `i` is \(k-1\), which means the loop will execute at least once.
- No other variables in the loop head need adjustment since they are not mentioned in the loop condition or initialization.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial value of `i` and ensure it is valid for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is \(k-1\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once, as required.
