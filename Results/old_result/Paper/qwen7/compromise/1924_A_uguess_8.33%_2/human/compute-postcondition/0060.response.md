Postcondition: **All characters in the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is incremented by the number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\). If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `i` is `k-1`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'c', and `ans` is 'ca' * (n - cnt - 1).**
