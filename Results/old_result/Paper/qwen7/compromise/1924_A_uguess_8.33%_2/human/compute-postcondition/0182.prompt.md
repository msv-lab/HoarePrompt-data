Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and the initial conditions for the subsequent code execution are set.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All characters in the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is incremented by the number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\). If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `i` is `k-1`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'c', and `ans` is 'ca' * (n - cnt - 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All characters in the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\), and `i` is \(k-1\). If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `i` remains `k-1`, `cur` remains 0, and `cnt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` becomes \(2k-1\), `cur` becomes 0, `tmp` becomes an empty string, `cnt` becomes 0, and `ans` becomes `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is `2k-1`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or 'a' + `2k-1`, and `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times if `cnt` is less than `n`, or `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
