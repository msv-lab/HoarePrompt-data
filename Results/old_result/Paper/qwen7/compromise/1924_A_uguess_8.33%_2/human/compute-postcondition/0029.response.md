Output State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))} + 1\), `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 2, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by \(2^{cur_ss}\). Given that `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is updated to its original value plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))} + 1\). The value of `cnt` is increased by 2, and `cur_ss` remains unchanged.
