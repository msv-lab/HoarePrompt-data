Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. The program iterates through each character of the input string `s` and uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track which of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets have been encountered.
3. When the bitmask `cur` matches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` alphabets have been seen in sequence, and the counter `cnt` is incremented.
4. After processing the entire string `s`, the program checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
5. If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string `ans` that represents a sequence of length `n` which cannot be found as a subsequence in `s`.

Given the provided logic and the problem constraints, the program appears to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
