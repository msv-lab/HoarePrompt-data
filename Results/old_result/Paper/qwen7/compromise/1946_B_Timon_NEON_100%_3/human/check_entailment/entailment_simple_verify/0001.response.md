### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(number):
    return number % 1000000007
```
This function correctly computes the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is used to ensure the result fits within the required range.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
    
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
    
    return total_max_segment
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `new_segment` and `max_segment` are initialized incorrectly. They should store the sum and index of the current segment.
   - `segments_variants` stores potential segments with non-negative sums.
   - `max_sum` is set to -1 to track the maximum sum found.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - The loop iterates over the array and updates `max_segment` and `new_segment` based on the current element.
   - If a negative element is encountered, it checks which segment (current or previous) has a higher sum and appends the appropriate segment to `segments_variants`.
   - If a non-negative element is encountered, it updates both `max_segment` and `new_segment`.

3. **Appending segments**:
   - After the loop, it appends the final `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants`.

4. **Finding the maximum segment**:
   - It iterates over `segments_variants` to find the segment with the highest sum (excluding single-element segments).

5. **Return the result**:
   - The function returns the range of the segment with the highest sum.

#### Main Logic:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_segment = func_2(a)
    if max_segment[0] == -1:
        max_segment[0] = 0
    answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]
    print(func_1(answer))
```

1. **Read input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the length `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - Read the array `a`.

2. **Calculate the maximum segment**:
   - Call `func_2` to get the maximum segment with a non-negative sum.

3. **Compute the answer**:
   - If the maximum segment sum is -1, set it to 0.
   - Compute the answer as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0)`.
   - Print the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Initialization**:
   - `new_segment` and `max_segment` should store the sum and index of the current segment, not just the sum.

2. **Handling Negative Elements**:
   - The logic for handling negative elements is flawed. It should only consider positive sums when extending the current segment.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - `func_3` is completely unused and incomplete.

### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the sum of the entire array.
- If the sum of the array is positive, adding the sum multiple times can maximize the result.
- If the sum is negative, consider the largest positive subarray and possibly the entire array if it helps.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem due to logical errors and incompleteness. The main issue lies in the `func_2` function, which incorrectly handles segments and does not compute the actual sums of the segments.

**Final: False**
