### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - **Empty Subarray Insertion**: Inserting the sum of an empty subarray (which is 0) does not change the array's sum but can be used to fill gaps.
   - **Positive Subarray Insertion**: Inserting the sum of a positive subarray increases the array's sum.
   - **Negative Subarray Insertion**: Inserting the sum of a negative subarray decreases the array's sum, so it should be avoided unless necessary.

3. **Approach**:
   - **Finding Maximum Positive Subarray Sum**: We need to identify the largest positive subarray sum.
   - **Using Empty Subarrays**: We can use empty subarrays to fill in gaps without changing the sum.
   - **Operations Limitation**: The number of operations (`k`) can be used to increase the sum by inserting the sum of positive subarrays multiple times.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the maximum sum of a subarray. However, it seems overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

5. **Simplified Approach**:
   - Calculate the sum of the array.
   - Identify the maximum sum of any subarray.
   - Use the remaining operations to add the maximum subarray sum as many times as possible.

6. **Implementation**:
   - Calculate the initial sum of the array.
   - Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
   - Determine how many times the maximum subarray sum can be added within `k` operations.
   - Adjust the sum accordingly and apply the modulo operation.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly implement the solution. Specifically, `func_2` is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases. A more straightforward approach is needed to solve the problem efficiently.

**Correctness: False**
