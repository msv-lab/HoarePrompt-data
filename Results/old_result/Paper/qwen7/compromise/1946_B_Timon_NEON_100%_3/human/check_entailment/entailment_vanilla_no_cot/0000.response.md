Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incomplete Function 3 Definition**: 
   - `func_3` is defined but not implemented. It should calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, but the function body is empty.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of contiguous subarrays, but it seems to be trying to handle both positive and negative segments separately. This approach is overly complex and not necessary for the problem.
   - The logic for handling positive and negative segments is flawed and not aligned with the problem requirements.

3. **Lack of Handling for Operations**:
   - The problem requires performing `k` operations where you can insert the sum of any contiguous subarray anywhere in the array. The current implementation does not account for these operations.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - While the function `func_1` correctly applies the modulo operation, it is not used in the context of the main solution.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Initial Sum**: Compute the initial sum of the array.
2. **Determine Maximum Possible Sum After Operations**: Since you can insert the sum of any subarray `k` times, the maximum sum can be achieved by adding the sum of the entire array `k` times to the initial sum.
3. **Apply Modulo Operation**: Ensure the result is within the required modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import *

def max_possible_sum(n, k, arr):
    # Calculate the initial sum of the array
    initial_sum = sum(arr)
    
    # Calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations
    max_sum = (initial_sum * k) % 1000000007
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_possible_sum(n, k, arr))
```

This solution directly calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations and ensures the result is within the required modulo.
