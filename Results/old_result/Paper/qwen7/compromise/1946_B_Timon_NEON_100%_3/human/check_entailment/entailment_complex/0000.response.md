Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing \( k \) operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The solution involves using the sum of the largest subarray with a non-negative sum and applying the power of 2 for the number of operations.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function correctly computes the remainder when the given number is divided by \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is necessary to handle large sums.
   - **`func_2`**: This function identifies the largest subarray with a non-negative sum. However, the logic seems flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the case where the entire array has a negative sum. Instead of returning the range of the largest subarray, it should return the sum of the largest subarray.
   - **`func_3`**: This function is not used in the provided code and is irrelevant to the problem.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The core logic in `func_2` should identify the largest subarray with a non-negative sum and return its sum.
   - The formula used in the main loop is correct: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - The modulo operation in `func_1` is correctly applied to ensure the result fits within the required bounds.

4. **Flaw in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` incorrectly returns a range instead of the sum of the largest subarray with a non-negative sum.
   - The logic for handling the entire array being negative is missing.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly compute the sum of the largest subarray with a non-negative sum.

Correctness: **False**
