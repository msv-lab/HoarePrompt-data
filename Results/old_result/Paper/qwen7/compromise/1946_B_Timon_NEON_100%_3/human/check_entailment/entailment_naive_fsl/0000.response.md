Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the main requirement of performing k operations to maximize the sum of the array.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It does not contribute to solving the main problem.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not account for inserting the sum of the subarray into the array multiple times as specified in the problem statement.
   - For example, consider the input `[2, 2, 8]` with \(k = 3\). The correct approach would be to insert the sum of the entire array three times, resulting in `[2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48]` with a sum of 96. However, `func_2` does not achieve this.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is incomplete and does not provide any logic to solve the problem. It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
