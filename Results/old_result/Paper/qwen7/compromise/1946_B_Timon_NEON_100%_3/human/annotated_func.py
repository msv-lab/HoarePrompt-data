#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the range (start_index, end_index) of the largest subarray with a length greater than 1 that has a non-negative sum. If no such subarray exists, it returns a range with start_index and end_index both set to -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters, `number` (an integer) and `quantity` (a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 200000). It initializes a variable `answer` to 0 and then returns this `answer`. The function does not modify the input parameters and always returns 0 regardless of the values of `number` and `quantity`.
