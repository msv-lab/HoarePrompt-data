You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:

    #State: Output State: `max_sum` is the sum of the largest subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the range of the largest subarray with non-negative elements as [start_index, end_index], `segments_variants` is a list of all subarray ranges with non-negative sums.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `max_sum` is the sum of the largest subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the range of the largest subarray with non-negative elements as [start_index, end_index], `segments_variants` is a list of all subarray ranges with non-negative sums, and `total_max_segment` is the range of the largest subarray among all subarrays in `segments_variants` with length greater than 1.
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns the range of the largest subarray among all subarrays in `segments_variants` with length greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, and returns the range of the largest subarray with a length greater than 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the range of the largest subarray among all subarrays in `segments_variants` with length greater than 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
