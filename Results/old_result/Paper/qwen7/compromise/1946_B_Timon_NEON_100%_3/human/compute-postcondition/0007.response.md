Output State: **`max_sum` is the sum of the largest subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the range of the largest subarray with non-negative elements as [start_index, end_index], `segments_variants` is a list of all subarray ranges with non-negative sums, and `segments_variants` now includes `[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], len(arr) - 1]`.**

This means that the `segments_variants` list now contains the updated range of the largest subarray with non-negative elements, extended to include the last index of the array `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
