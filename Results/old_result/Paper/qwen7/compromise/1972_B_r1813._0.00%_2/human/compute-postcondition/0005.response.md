Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `index`, `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
