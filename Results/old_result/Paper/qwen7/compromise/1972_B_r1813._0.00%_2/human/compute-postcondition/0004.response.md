Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[index-1]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D"**.

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is 1, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 2. The value of `t` is obtained from `data[index]`, but since `index` is now 2, `t` is actually obtained from `data[index-1]`, which was `data[1]` before the increment. All other variables (`n` and `s`) remain unchanged.
