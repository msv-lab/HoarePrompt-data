Reasoning:

1. **Function Parameters and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. This matches the expected input format.
2. **List `c` Calculation**: The list `c` is computed as the element-wise minimum of lists `a` and `b`. This step is correct according to the problem statement.
3. **Suffix Sum List Calculation**: The suffix sum list `suff` is calculated correctly. Each element `suff[i]` indeed represents the sum of elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.
4. **Minimum Cost Calculation**: The function iterates through the first `k` elements of `a` and calculates `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for each `i` in the range `[0, k)`. It then finds and prints the minimum value of these sums. This approach ensures that Kirill's cost is minimized while ensuring he ends up in one of the first `k` positions.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
