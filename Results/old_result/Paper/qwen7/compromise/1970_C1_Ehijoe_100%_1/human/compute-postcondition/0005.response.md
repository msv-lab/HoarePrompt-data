Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of n-1 edges where each edge connects two nodes, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes (neighbors).

In this output state, after executing the loop, the variable `n` remains the same, `t` remains 1, and `u` and `v` represent the last pair of nodes that were added to the graph. The `edges` list contains all the edges input by the user, connecting the nodes specified in each iteration of the loop. The `empty` variable is set to False since the `nodes` dictionary has been populated with at least one edge. The `nodes` dictionary now contains each node as a key, with its corresponding value being a list of all nodes it is connected to.
