Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, edges is a list of (u, v) pairs representing the edges of an undirected graph, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes.

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `nodes` will contain a dictionary where each key is a node (an integer between 1 and n) and its value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it. The variable `edges` will be a list containing all the edges of the graph as tuples (u, v). The variable `empty` will be set to False since the `nodes` dictionary has been populated with at least one edge.
