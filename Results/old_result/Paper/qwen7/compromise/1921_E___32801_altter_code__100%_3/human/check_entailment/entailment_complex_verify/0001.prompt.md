You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints 'Draw' and returns, which is correct because Bob is already in the first row and cannot move further up.

3. **Odd Difference Check:**
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can always win by moving diagonally towards Bob, so it prints 'Alice'.
     - Otherwise, the program attempts to simulate moves to see if Alice can force a win. However, the logic here seems overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

4. **Even Difference Check:**
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is even.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can always win by moving towards Alice, so it prints 'Bob'.
     - Otherwise, the program again attempts to simulate moves to see if Bob can force a win. Again, the logic seems overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

5. **Simulated Moves:**
   - The program simulates moves by adjusting the positions of Alice and Bob and checking if Alice or Bob can force a win.
   - The logic for determining if a player can force a win seems to involve calculating distances and checking if certain conditions are met, but the implementation is not straightforward and may contain errors.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it does not correctly handle scenarios where Alice or Bob is on the boundary of the board.
  - The logic for determining if a player can force a win is overly complex and may not be correct in all scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game rules and does not handle all edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
