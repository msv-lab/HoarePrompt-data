### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints 'Draw' and returns, which is correct because Bob is already in the first row and cannot move further up.

3. **Odd Difference Check:**
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can always win by moving diagonally towards Bob, so it prints 'Alice'.
     - Otherwise, the program attempts to simulate moves to see if Alice can force a win. However, the logic here seems overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

4. **Even Difference Check:**
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is even.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can always win by moving towards Alice, so it prints 'Bob'.
     - Otherwise, the program again attempts to simulate moves to see if Bob can force a win. Again, the logic seems overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

5. **Simulated Moves:**
   - The program simulates moves by adjusting the positions of Alice and Bob and checking if Alice or Bob can force a win.
   - The logic for determining if a player can force a win seems to involve calculating distances and checking if certain conditions are met, but the implementation is not straightforward and may contain errors.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Edge Cases:
- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program does not handle scenarios where Alice or Bob is on the boundary of the board. For example, if Alice is at the bottom row (`x1 = h`) and Bob is in a position where Alice can't move down anymore, the program should handle this correctly.
  - Similarly, if Bob is at the top row (`x2 = 1`) and Alice is in a position where Bob can't move up anymore, the program should handle this correctly.

- **Complexity of Logic:**
  - The logic for determining if a player can force a win is overly complex and may not be correct in all scenarios. For instance, the conditions involving `a`, `b`, `t`, and `c` are not clearly explained and may lead to incorrect conclusions.

### Correctness of the Given Program:
- **Initial Conditions Check:**
  - Correctly handles the case when Bob is in the first row (`x2 <= x1`).

- **Odd Difference Check:**
  - Correctly handles the case when `y1 == y2` and Alice can always win.
  - The logic for simulating moves to see if Alice can force a win is overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

- **Even Difference Check:**
  - Correctly handles the case when `y1 == y2` and Bob can always win.
  - The logic for simulating moves to see if Bob can force a win is overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

- **Simulated Moves:**
  - The logic for simulating moves is complex and may not be correct in all scenarios. For example, the conditions involving `a`, `b`, `t`, and `c` are not clearly explained and may lead to incorrect conclusions.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game rules and does not handle all edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
