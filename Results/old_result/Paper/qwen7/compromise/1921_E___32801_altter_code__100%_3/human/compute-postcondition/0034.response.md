Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is two more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value, `y2` is the same as the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`.
