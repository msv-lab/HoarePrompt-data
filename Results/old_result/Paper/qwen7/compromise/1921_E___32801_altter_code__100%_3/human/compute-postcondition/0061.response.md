Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is the third element of r, y1 is the fourth element of r, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, and y1 is not equal to y2, y2 is less than y1, a is m - y1.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `m - y1`. All other variables retain their initial states. The precondition that `y1` is not equal to `y2` and `y2` is less than `y1` remains valid.
