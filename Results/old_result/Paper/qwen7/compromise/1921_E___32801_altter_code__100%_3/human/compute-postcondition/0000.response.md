Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `r = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `r`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still a positive integer within the specified range.
