Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a`.
- `y1` is the fourth element of `r`.
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`.
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `b` is `x2 - x1`.
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1` or `x1` is less than 1 or `x2` is greater than `n`.

The `print('draw')` statement will simply print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
