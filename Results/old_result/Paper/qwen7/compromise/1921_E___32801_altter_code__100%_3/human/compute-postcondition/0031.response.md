Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is four more than its original value, `y1` is zero less than its original value, `y2` is the same as the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`. The condition `x2 <= x1` or `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n` is true.**
