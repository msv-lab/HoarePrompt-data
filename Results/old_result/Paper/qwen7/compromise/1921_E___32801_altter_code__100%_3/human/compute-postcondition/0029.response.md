Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is two more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value, `y2` is the same as the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code `x1 += a` increments `x1` by the value of `a`. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `x1` is now one more than its original value. Therefore, `x1` is two more than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
