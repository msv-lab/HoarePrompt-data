Output State: **`r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is two more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value, `y2` is 1, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, and `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)`**.

Explanation: The code `y2 = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to `y2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Since `y2` was previously defined as being equal to the fourth element of `r`, and now it is explicitly set to 1, we update `y2` to 1. The rest of the conditions and relationships involving the other variables remain the same as per the initial state.
