Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is now x1 + 1, y1 is one less than the fourth element of r, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the same as the fourth element of r, x2 is greater than x1.**

In this output state, the value of `x1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
