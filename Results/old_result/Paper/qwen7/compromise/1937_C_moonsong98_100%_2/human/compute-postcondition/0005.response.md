Output State: **`max_index` is 0, `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2.**

The code initializes `max_index` to 0. This does not affect the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `n` being an input integer within the range 2 to 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2, while `max_index` is set to 0.
