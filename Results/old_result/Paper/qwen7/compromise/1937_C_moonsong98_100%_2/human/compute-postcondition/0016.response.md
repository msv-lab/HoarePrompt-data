Output State: **`max_index` is the index of the first character in the string representation of numbers from 0 to n-1 that is less than the character at index `max_index`, or 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing the indices of all elements `i` in the range 0 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns either '<' or '=', `min_index` is the index in `min_indices` that satisfies the condition `res == '='` in the loop, or `min_indices[0]` if no such index exists; `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(max_index, min_index)` is called with the current values of `max_index` and `min_index`. No new variables are assigned values, and the values of `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the addition of the fact that `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been called.
