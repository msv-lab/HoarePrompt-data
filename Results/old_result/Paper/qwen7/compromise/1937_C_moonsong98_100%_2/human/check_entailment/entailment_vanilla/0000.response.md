### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \(? a b c d\) to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - After finding the optimal pair, we print the answer in the form \(! i j\).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is used to ask a query and get the result.
   - `func_2` is used to provide the final answer.
   - `func_3` is the main function that implements the logic to find the optimal pair.

3. **Logic Breakdown:**
   - For \(n = 2\), it directly prints the answer \(! 0 1\) without further queries, which is correct.
   - For \(n > 2\):
     - It initializes `max_index` to 0.
     - It iterates through indices from 0 to \(n-1\) to find the index with the highest \((p_0 \mid p_i)\). This is done by comparing \((p_0 \mid p_{max\_index})\) with \((p_0 \mid p_i)\).
     - It then finds the minimum index among those that have the same \((p_{max\_index} \mid p_i)\) as \((p_{max\_index} \mid p_{min\_indices[0]})\).
     - Finally, it compares the results to find the optimal pair.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The approach seems logical and should work for finding the optimal pair.
   - The code correctly handles the base case \(n = 2\).
   - The main loop to find the maximum XOR is implemented correctly.
   - The final comparison to find the optimal pair is also handled correctly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case \(n = 2\) correctly.
   - The main logic should handle larger values of \(n\) as well, given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the given problem description and the provided example. It correctly implements the logic to find the optimal pair of indices and uses the allowed number of queries.

**Correctness: **True**
