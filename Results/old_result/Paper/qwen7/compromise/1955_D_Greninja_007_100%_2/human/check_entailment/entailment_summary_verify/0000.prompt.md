You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Note

In the first example, all subsegments are good.

In the second example, good subsegments start at positions 1 , 2 , and 3 .

In the third example, good subsegments start at positions 1 and 2 .

- Program:
from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts integers n, m, and k along with two lists a and b. It returns the count of times the sum of the minimum occurrences of elements present in both lists a and b up to index m-1 reaches or exceeds k during a sliding window operation over list a.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the subsegment does not contain enough elements from `b` to satisfy the requirement of having at least `k` matching elements. Specifically, the program calculates the initial number of matching elements (`sm`) using the first subsegment of length `m` from `a`, but it does not correctly update this count as it slides the window across the array. 

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  7 4 3
  4 1 2 3 4 5 6
  1 2 3 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  4
  ```

In this case, the subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are good, but the subsegment starting at position 4 is not good because it only matches 2 elements from `b` instead of the required 3. However, the program incorrectly counts this subsegment as good.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the sliding window correctly updates the count of matching elements and properly handles the condition for each subsegment.
