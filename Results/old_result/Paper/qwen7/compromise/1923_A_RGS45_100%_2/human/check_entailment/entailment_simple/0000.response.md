Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a single block without any free cells between them. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to achieve this.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution. Hereâ€™s why:
   - The program finds the first and last positions of '1' (chips) in the string representation of the array.
   - It then extracts the substring between these positions.
   - Finally, it counts the number of '0's in this substring.
3. This approach is incorrect because:
   - It only counts the '0's between the first and last chip, but it doesn't account for the need to move chips to the leftmost possible position.
   - Moving a chip to the leftmost possible position might involve multiple steps, not just the direct distance to the nearest free cell.
4. A correct approach would be to count the number of '0's to the left of the first '1' and the number of '0's to the right of the last '1', and then take the maximum of these two values plus one (to account for the initial position of the first and last chip).

Correctness: **False**
