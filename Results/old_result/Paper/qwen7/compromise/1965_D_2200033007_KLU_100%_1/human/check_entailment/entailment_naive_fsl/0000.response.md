Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not seem to address the core requirement of recovering a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Instead, they appear to be generating and processing subarray sums, which is not directly related to solving the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- Input: `n = 3`, subarray sums excluding one: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`

The correct palindrome array for this input should be `[1, 2, 1]`. However, the provided functions do not generate this array. They instead focus on processing the subarray sums, which does not lead to the recovery of the palindrome array.

Specifically, the function `func_4` is not used in the solution and seems unnecessary. The main issue is that none of the functions actually implement the logic to recover the palindrome array from the given subarray sums.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
