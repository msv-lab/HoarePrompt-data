Output State: **The program returns a list `cts` which contains all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to len(`a`) - 1, and this list is sorted.**

This means that the program returns a sorted list of cumulative sums for all subarrays of the list `a`. Each element in the list `cts` represents the sum of a subarray ending at a particular index in `a`. The list is sorted in ascending order.
