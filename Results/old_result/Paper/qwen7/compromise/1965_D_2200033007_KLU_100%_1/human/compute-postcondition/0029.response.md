Output State: **`prev` is equal to `x`, `x` is the third element of the list `odds`, if `idx` is equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is equal to `x`, otherwise `idx` is decremented by 1 and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is equal to `(x - prev) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `prev = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `prev`. This does not affect the relationship between `idx` and the elements in the list `a`, nor does it change the value of `x` itself. Therefore, the conditions involving `idx` and the elements in `a` remain unchanged.
