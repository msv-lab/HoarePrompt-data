Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed.
  - `smallList` must have at least one element.
  - The last element of `smallList` is no longer equal to the last element of `bigList`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true.

2. **Current State**:
   - `bigList` has its last element removed, so `bigList[-1]` is no longer the same as the last element of `bigList` from the previous iteration.
   - `smallList` must have at least one element, but the last element of `smallList` is no longer equal to the last element of `bigList`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `bigList[-1]` is no longer equal to `smallList[-1]`, the second part of the loop condition (`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`) is false.
   - Therefore, to make the loop continue, we need to adjust either `len(smallList)` or `bigList[-1]` such that the loop condition becomes true again.

4. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - We cannot change `smallList` because it must have at least one element, and we need to ensure `len(smallList) > 0`.
   - We need to adjust `bigList` such that `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` becomes true.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To make the loop continue, we need to add an element to `bigList` that matches the last element of `smallList`.

### Final State:
State: **`bigList` must have its last element added to match the last element of `smallList`, and `smallList` must have at least one element**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`bigList` must have its last element added to match the last element of `smallList`, and `smallList` must have at least one element**.
