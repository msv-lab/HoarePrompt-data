Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `x`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `prev` is equal to `x`.
   - `x` is the second element of the list `odds`.
   - `idx` is decremented by 1.
   - `prev` is now equal to `x` after the assignment.

3. **Determine the next value of `x`**: Since the loop iterates over the elements of the list `odds`, the next value of `x` will be the third element of the list `odds`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `prev` will be equal to the new value of `x` (which is the third element of the list `odds`).
   - `x` will be the third element of the list `odds`.
   - `idx` will be decremented by 1 from its previous value (since it was already decremented by 1 in the previous iteration).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`prev` is equal to the third element of the list `odds`, `x` is the third element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1**
