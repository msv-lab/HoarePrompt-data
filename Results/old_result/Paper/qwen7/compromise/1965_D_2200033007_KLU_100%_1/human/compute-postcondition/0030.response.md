Output State: **`prev` is equal to `x`, `x` is the third element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is equal to `(x - prev) // 2` if the condition `idx == n - 1 - idx` is false, otherwise `a[idx]` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = idx - 1` simply decrements the value of `idx` by 1. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
