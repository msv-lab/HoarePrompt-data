Output State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is `sm + a[i + 1] + a[j] + a[j]`, `cts` is `[sm + a[i + 1], sm, sm]`**

Explanation: The line `cts.append(sm)` appends the value of `sm` to the list `cts`. Initially, `cts` was `[sm + a[i + 1], sm]`. After appending `sm`, `cts` becomes `[sm + a[i + 1], sm, sm]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
