Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and it iterates over the range from `i` to `len(a)`. Therefore, the variables `i` and `j` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` must be less than `len(a)`
   - `j` is `i + 1`
   - `sm` is `sm + a[i + 1] + a[j]`
   - `cts` is `cts + [sm + a[i + 1]]`
   - `cts` is `cts + [sm]`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` starts as `i + 1`, in the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be within the range of `i` to `len(a)`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` remains the same because it is not being modified in the loop.
- `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value of `i + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` must be less than `len(a)`
- `j` will be `i + 2` (since it was `i + 1` before and now it is incremented by 1)

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is `sm + a[i + 1] + a[j]`, `cts` is `cts + [sm + a[i + 1]]`, `cts` is `cts + [sm]`**
