Output State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`, `j` is `i + 1`, `sm` is `sm + a[i + 1] + a[j]`, `cts` is `cts + [sm + a[i + 1]]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by adding `a[j]` to the current value of `sm`. Given that `j` is defined as `i + 1`, the updated value of `sm` becomes `sm + a[i + 1] + a[j]`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `cts`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
