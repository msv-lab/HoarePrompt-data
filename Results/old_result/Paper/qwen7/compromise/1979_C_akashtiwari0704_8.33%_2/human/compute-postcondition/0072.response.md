Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < bets`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` is 'a[0]a[1]'
   - `bets` must be greater than 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `bets` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3 (since it was 2 and it increments by 1).
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `bets` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is 'a[0]a[1]', `bets` must be greater than 1**
