Output State: **`bets` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is a string containing the first two elements of `a` separated by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently 1) to `ans` followed by a space. Since `i` was initially 1, after this operation, `i` is incremented to 2. The updated `ans` now contains the first two elements of `a` separated by a space. The precondition that `bets` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
