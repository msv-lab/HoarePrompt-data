Postcondition: **`bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `int(a[i])` for each iteration from 0 to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`. Additionally, the sum of `int(a[i])` is less than `prod`.**
