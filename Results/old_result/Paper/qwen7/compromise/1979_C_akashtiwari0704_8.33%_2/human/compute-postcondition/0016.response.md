Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is less than `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `a[i]` converted to integer.**

Explanation: The code updates `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` was previously updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` now holds the sum of these integer values. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
