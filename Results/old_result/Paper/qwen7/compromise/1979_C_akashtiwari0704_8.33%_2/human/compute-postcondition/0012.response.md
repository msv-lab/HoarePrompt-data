Output State: `t` is 0, `bets` must be equal to the length of the list `a`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains 0. The variable `bets` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `bets` (which is the same as the length of `a`). The list `a` remains unchanged, and the variable `prod` will hold the product of all the integers in the list `a`.
