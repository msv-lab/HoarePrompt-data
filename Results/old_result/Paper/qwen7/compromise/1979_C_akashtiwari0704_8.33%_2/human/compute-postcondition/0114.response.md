Postcondition: **`bets` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is 0, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets-1`, `sumo` is the cumulative sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` in the list is updated to the value of `prod // a[i]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not change these values. Otherwise, `i` is set to `bets - 1`, `prod` remains unchanged, and `ans` is the string value of `a[0]` concatenated with the string values of all `a[i]` for `i` from `0` to `bets-1` separated by spaces.**
