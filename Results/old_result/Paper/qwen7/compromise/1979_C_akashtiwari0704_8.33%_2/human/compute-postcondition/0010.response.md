Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `prod` is the product of `a[0] * a[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `prod` is now multiplied by `a[3]`. However, since the initial value of `prod` was the product of `a[0] * a[1]`, after executing the line, `prod` becomes `a[0] * a[1] * a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
