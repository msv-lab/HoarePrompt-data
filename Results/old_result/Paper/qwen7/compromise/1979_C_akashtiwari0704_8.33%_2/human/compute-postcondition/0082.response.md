Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `bets`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `T` is initialized to `bets`.
   - `bets` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.
   - `prod` is initialized to 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `bets` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = bets - 1`.
   - The value of `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `bets` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` is `bets`, `bets` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0**
