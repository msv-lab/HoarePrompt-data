The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `bets` must be a positive integer and at least 3, and `i` is the current value of `bets` minus 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it equal to the current value of `bets`. Also, `bets` must remain a positive integer and at least 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`bets` must be a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is `bets` - 1**
