Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves where rooks are placed such that no two rooks attack each other. The moves are mirrored between the player and the computer, except when the coordinates are the same, in which case the computer skips its turn.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then iterates through the moves, counting how many moves were mirrored (`num`).
   - The variable `m` is calculated as the remaining number of moves that can still be made, which is `n - num`.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining cells without violating the rook placement rules. This is done using the `dp` array, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fill `i` cells.
   - The base cases are set up correctly: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The dynamic programming recurrence relation is also correctly implemented: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
   - Finally, the function prints the result for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `m` is 0 or 1, the function correctly handles these edge cases by printing 1, which is the correct number of configurations.
   - The dynamic programming approach correctly accounts for the remaining cells and ensures that no two rooks attack each other.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
