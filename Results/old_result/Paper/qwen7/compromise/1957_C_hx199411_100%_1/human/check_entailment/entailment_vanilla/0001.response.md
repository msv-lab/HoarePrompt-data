### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard with alternating moves between the player and the computer.
   - The player starts first, and the computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is along the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - We need to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \( k \) moves, considering the constraints and the modulo operation.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and the coordinates of the \( k \) moves.
   - It calculates `num` which counts how many moves were along the diagonal (where the computer cannot mirror).
   - It then calculates `m` as \( n - \text{num} \), which represents the number of non-diagonal positions left to place rooks.
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Dynamic Programming Explanation:**
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to store the number of ways to place rooks in up to `m` positions.
   - Base cases are set for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` ensures that the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions is calculated correctly, considering the constraints of no attacking rooks.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `m` is 0 or 1, the code handles these edge cases correctly by printing 1.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

5. **Verification:**
   - The code logic aligns with the problem statement and the example provided.
   - The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of valid configurations.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: **True**
