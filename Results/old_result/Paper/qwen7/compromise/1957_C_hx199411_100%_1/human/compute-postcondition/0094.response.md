Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `dp[i]` is assigned the value `dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(3, m + 1)`.

### Understanding the Loop Head
- The loop variable `i` starts from 3 and goes up to `m`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `m`.

### Adjusting the States
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, if the loop is about to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - If the loop just finished an iteration where `i` was `k`, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

2. **Variables `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`:**
   - These values are used in the calculation to determine `dp[i]`.
   - For the next iteration, `dp[i-1]` will become `dp[i]` from the previous iteration, and `dp[i-2]` will become `dp[i-1]` from the previous iteration.

### Determining the New State
- Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`.
- Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `dp[k]` will be the new `dp[i-1]`.
- `dp[k-1]` will be the new `dp[i-2]`.

### Final State
Given that the loop is about to execute again, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `dp[i-1]` will be the value of `dp[k]` from the previous iteration.
- `dp[i-2]` will be the value of `dp[k-1]` from the previous iteration.

Since the exact values of `dp[k]` and `dp[k-1]` are not provided, we will represent them as `dp[k]` and `dp[k-1]` respectively.

### Final Answer
State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value (`dp[i - 1]' + (`i - 1') * `dp[i - 2]' * 2) modulo (10^9 + 7), `i` is 4, `dp[3]` is the value of `dp[k]` from the previous iteration, `dp[2]` is the value of `dp[k-1]` from the previous iteration**.

If we denote the values from the previous iteration as `dp[k]` and `dp[k-1]`, the final state can be written as:

State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value (`dp[i - 1]' + (`i - 1') * `dp[i - 2]' * 2) modulo (10^9 + 7), `i` is 4, `dp[3]` is the value of `dp[k]` from the previous iteration, `dp[2]` is the value of `dp[k-1]` from the previous iteration**.

In a more simplified form, if we know the specific values:

State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value (`dp[i - 1]' + (`i - 1') * `dp[i - 2]' * 2) modulo (10^9 + 7), `i` is 4, `dp[3]` is the value of `dp[k]` from the previous iteration, `dp[2]` is the value of `dp[k-1]` from the previous iteration**.

If we don't have specific values, we can generalize it as:

State: **`dp[i]` is assigned the value (`dp[i - 1]' + (`i - 1') * `dp[i - 2]' * 2) modulo (10^9 + 7), `i` is 4, `dp[3]` is the value of `dp[k]` from the previous iteration, `dp[2]` is the value of `dp[k-1]` from the previous iteration**.
