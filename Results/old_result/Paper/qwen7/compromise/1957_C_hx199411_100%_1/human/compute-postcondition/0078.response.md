Output State: **`m` is `n - num`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations, `i` is `k + (k - 1)`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, and `i` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The code `m = n - num` simply assigns the value of `n - num` to the variable `m`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `i` is greater than `k` also remains valid.
