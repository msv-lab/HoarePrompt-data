Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is updated to the integer value entered by the user through `input()`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) remain in their original conditions, and the constraint on the sum of `n` over all test cases also remains unchanged.
