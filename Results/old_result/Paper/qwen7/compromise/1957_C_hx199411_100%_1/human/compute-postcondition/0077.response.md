Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations, `i` is `k + (k - 1)`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num`, and `i` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `k + (k - 1)` because `i` starts at `k - 1` and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `k`. The variable `num` will hold the cumulative sum of 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r`. The value of `m` will be `n - num`, reflecting the remaining count after accounting for all pairs processed. The values of `c` and `r` will be the last pair of integers input during the loop's final iteration.
