Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the second input, `r` is an integer from the second input, and `num` is either 3 or 4 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not.**

The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `num`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
