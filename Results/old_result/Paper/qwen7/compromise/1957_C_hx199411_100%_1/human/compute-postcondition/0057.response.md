Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is less than `k`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The value of `m` is still `n - num`, which is `n - 0` or simply `n`, since `num` was initialized to 0. The condition that `i` must be less than `k` is still valid.
