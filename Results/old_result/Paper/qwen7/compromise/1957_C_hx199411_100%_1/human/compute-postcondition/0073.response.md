Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is `num + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `num` was previously `num + 1` (if `c` equals `r`) or `num + 2` (if `c` does not equal `r`), after this increment, `num` is now `num + 1`. Additionally, `m` is recalculated as `n - num - 1` because `num` has increased by 1.
