Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `c` is an input integer from the second input
   - `r` is an input integer from the second input
   - `num` is either 3 or 4 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop runs from `range(k)`, the loop will execute as long as `i < k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Therefore, `i` should be updated to 2.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `k` stays the same.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains 0.
   - `n` remains an input integer.
   - `k` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `c` remains an input integer from the second input.
   - `r` remains an input integer from the second input.
   - `num` remains either 3 or 4 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is an input integer from the second input, `r` is an input integer from the second input, and `num` is either 3 or 4 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not.**
