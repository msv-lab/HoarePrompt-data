Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

3. **Current state before the loop**: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n\). The values of `r_i` and `c_i` are not relevant to the loop condition.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is initially set to the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this input is non-zero.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be non-zero**
