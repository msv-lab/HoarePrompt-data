Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `num + 2 * (k - 1)` or a value between `2 * k - 1` and `2 * k + 1` depending on the comparisons made inside the loop, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` will have been decremented by `2 * k` because it starts with `t - 2` and the loop runs `k` times. The variable `num` will be incremented by `2` for each iteration where `c` is not equal to `r` and by `1` for each iteration where `c` is equal to `r`. Since the loop runs `k` times, `num` will end up being either `k` (if `c` equals `r` every time) or `2 * k` (if `c` never equals `r`). However, intermediate values can vary based on the specific inputs given during each iteration. The variable `i` will be `k - 1` after the last iteration, and `c` and `r` will hold the values from the last input provided to the loop.
