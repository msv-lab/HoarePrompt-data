Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is `num + 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are now integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
