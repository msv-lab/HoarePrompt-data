State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`, `i` must be less than `k`**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function which uses `k`.
2. **Determine Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(k)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i < k`.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Given that `i` is initially set to `k - 1`, the loop will start with `i = k - 1`.
4. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `k` at the start of the loop. Since `i` starts at `k - 1`, the loop will execute exactly once (if `k > 0`).
5. **Adjust States**: We need to ensure that the initial state of `i` (`k - 1`) satisfies the loop condition (`i < k`). Therefore, `i` must be less than `k`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `i` must be less than `k`.
