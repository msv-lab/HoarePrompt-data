Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `num` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Initially, `num` is not specified to have any particular value other than being updated here. Given that no initial value for `num` was provided other than it being incremented by 1, we set its new value to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
