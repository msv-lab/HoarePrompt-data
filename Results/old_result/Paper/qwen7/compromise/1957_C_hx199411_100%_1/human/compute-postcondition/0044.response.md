Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The variable `i` is then incremented by 2, making it `i + 2`. The condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2` remains unchanged.
