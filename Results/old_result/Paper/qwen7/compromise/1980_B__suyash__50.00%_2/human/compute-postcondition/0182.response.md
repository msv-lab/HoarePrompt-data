Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(l))`. The key variables here are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`. 

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**: The postcondition tells us that after the loop body executes, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`, `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, and in both cases (whether `k` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 0), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The length of the list `l` does not change within the loop, so `len(l)` remains the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `len(l)` remains unchanged.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `len(l)` remains the same**
