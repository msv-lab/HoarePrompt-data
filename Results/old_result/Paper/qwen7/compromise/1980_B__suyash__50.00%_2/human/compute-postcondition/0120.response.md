Output: **MAYBE** 

Explanation: The initial state only provides information about the variables `fav`, `i`, `l`, and `k`, but it does not give any specific values for these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string "MAYBE", and there is no calculation or reference to other variables within this statement. Therefore, regardless of the values of `fav`, `i`, `l`, and `k`, the output will always be the string "MAYBE".
