Output State: **`fav` is an integer, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `l` is a list of integers, `k` is decreased by the value at index `i_end` of list `l` or by `dic[l[i_end]]` if `fav` equals `l[i_end]`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= dic[l[i]]` decrements the value of `k` by the value of `dic[l[i_end]]` if `fav` is equal to `l[i_end + 1]`, otherwise, it decrements `k` by the value at index `i_end` of list `l`. The other variables (`fav`, `i`, `l`) remain unchanged.
