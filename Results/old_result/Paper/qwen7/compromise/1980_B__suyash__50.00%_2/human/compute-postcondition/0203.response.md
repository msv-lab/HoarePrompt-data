Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * dic[l[i]]`**

Explanation: The code `k -= dic[l[i]]` subtracts the value of `dic[l[i]]` from `k`. Given the initial state where `k` is `k - dic[l[i]]`, this operation is essentially performed twice, resulting in `k` being updated to `k - 2 * dic[l[i]]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was only incremented once before this line of code.
