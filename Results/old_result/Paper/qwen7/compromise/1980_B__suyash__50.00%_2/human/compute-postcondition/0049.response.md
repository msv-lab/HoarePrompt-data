Output State: **`fav` is an integer, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, and `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` if `fav` is equal to `l[i_end + 1]`, otherwise `k` is decreased by the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= dic[l[i]]` updates the value of `k` by subtracting the value of `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` from `k` if `fav` is equal to `l[i_end + 1]`, or by subtracting the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l` from `k` if `fav` is not equal to `l[i_end + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
