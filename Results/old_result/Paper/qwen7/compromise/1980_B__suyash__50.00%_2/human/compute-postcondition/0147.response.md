Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string `a` by spaces using the `split()` method, which results in a list of substrings. Then, `map(int, ...)` converts each substring into an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `b`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged, and `b` now holds the integer values from `a`.
