Based on the initial state provided:

- `fav` is an integer.
- `i` is an index + 3, meaning `i` is some integer value that is 3 more than an index.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i+1]]`, where `dic` is a dictionary and `l[i+1]` is an element from the list `l`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('MAYBE')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'MAYBE'`. Since no other variables or their values are directly used in this print statement, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **MAYBE**
