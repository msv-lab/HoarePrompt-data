Postcondition: `fav` is an integer, `i` is an index, `l` is a list of integers, and `k` is decreased by either the value at index `i` of list `l` (if `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`), or by the value of `dic[l[i]]` (if `fav` is equal to `l[i]`). Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the value of `k`.
