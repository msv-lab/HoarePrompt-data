Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `i` and `k`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 and `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]` before the `break` statement is executed. Therefore, these changes are kept, and the only additional information is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
