Output State: **`fav` is an integer, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` if `fav` equals `l[i_end + 1]`, otherwise `k` is decreased by the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= dic[l[i]]` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` from it if `fav` equals `l[i_end + 1]`, or by subtracting the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l` from it otherwise. The other variables (`fav`, `i`, `l`) remain unchanged.
