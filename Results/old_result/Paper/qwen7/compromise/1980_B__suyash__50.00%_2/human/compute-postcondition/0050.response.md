Based on the initial state provided:

- `fav` is an integer.
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` if `fav` is equal to `l[i_end + 1]`, otherwise `k` is decreased by the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l`.

The `print('MAYBE')` statement simply prints the string `'MAYBE'`. Since no specific values are provided for `fav`, `i_end`, `l`, `k`, or `dic`, we cannot determine the exact value of `k` after the decrement operation. However, the print statement itself does not depend on these values.

Output: **MAYBE**
