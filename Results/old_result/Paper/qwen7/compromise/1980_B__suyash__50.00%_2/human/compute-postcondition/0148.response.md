Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split()**.

Explanation: The code `o = input().split()` takes the input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This new list of strings is assigned to `o`. The initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, with `a` being a string and `b` being a list of integers derived from `a`.
