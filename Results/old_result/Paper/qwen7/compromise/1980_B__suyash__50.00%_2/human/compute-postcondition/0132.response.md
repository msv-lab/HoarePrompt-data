Output State: **`fav` is an integer, `i` is an index + 3, `l` is a list of integers, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i+1]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `k` was being modified. The values of `fav`, `i`, `l`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
