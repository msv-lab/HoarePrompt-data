Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Initialization of `b` List**: The list `b` is not initialized before use. This will lead to an error when trying to append values to it.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program reads `m` test cases but does not process them correctly. It calls `func_1()` without any parameters and does not store the results of processing each test case.
3. **Logic in `func_1()`**:
   - The logic for splitting numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits is mostly correct but could be simplified.
   - The check to ensure the array is sorted after splitting digits is also correct but could be more efficient.
4. **Output Handling**: The program should output 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, but it currently does not handle multiple test cases properly.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
m = int(input())
b = []

for i in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(int, a))
    c = []
    for num in a:
        if num > 10:
            c.extend([int(d) for d in str(num)])
        else:
            c.append(num)
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)

for result in b:
    if result == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version initializes `b`, processes each test case correctly, and outputs the results for each test case as required.
