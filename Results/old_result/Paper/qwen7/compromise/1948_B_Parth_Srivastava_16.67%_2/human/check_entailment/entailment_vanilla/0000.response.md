Reasoning:

1. The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The main issue lies in how the `func_1` function processes the array elements:
   - It incorrectly splits the elements into digits only when the element is greater than 10 and not at the beginning of the array.
   - It does not handle the case where the array might already be sorted after splitting.
   - It does not check if the resulting array is sorted after performing the operations.
3. The program initializes an empty list `b` but never appends any values to it within the loop that reads test cases. This means that `b` remains empty, and the program always prints 'NO' for all test cases.
4. The program does not actually perform the digit-splitting operation on the array elements as described in the problem statement. Instead, it seems to be trying to sort the array directly and checking if it's already sorted, which is not the intended approach.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
