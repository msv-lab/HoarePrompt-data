You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it creates a list c by appending elements based on specific conditions involving the digits of the integers in the list a. It then sorts the list c and checks if c is equal to its sorted version. If c is equal to its sorted version, it appends 1 to the list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return anything directly but modifies the list b based on the comparison result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains elements that cannot be broken down into smaller digits in a way that allows the array to be sorted. Specifically, the program does not check if the resulting array after breaking down the elements can be sorted. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store results. It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` but does not use the result of `func_1()`. This is incorrect because the results of `func_1()` should be stored in `b`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the size of the array `k` and the array itself.
   - It splits the array into individual digits and stores them in a list `c`.
   - The function checks if the current element is greater than 10 and attempts to break it down into its constituent digits.
   - However, the function does not ensure that the resulting array can be sorted. It simply checks if the resulting array `c` is sorted without considering the original array's structure and the operations allowed.

3. **Sorting Check**: The function sorts the list `c` and checks if it matches the original list `a`. This is incorrect because the original array `a` might not match the sorted list `c` after breaking down elements. The function should instead check if the original array `a` can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4
  12 3 45 67
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  The program does not correctly handle this case and may output `NO` because it does not properly simulate the transformation process.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the transformation process and check if the original array can be sorted through the allowed operations.
