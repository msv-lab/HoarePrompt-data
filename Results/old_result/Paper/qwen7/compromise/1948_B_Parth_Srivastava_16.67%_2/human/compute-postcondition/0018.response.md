Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) followed by another integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it returns a value based on the processed data.**
