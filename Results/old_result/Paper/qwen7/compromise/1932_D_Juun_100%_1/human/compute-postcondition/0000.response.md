Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the description of 2n cards consists of 2n two-character strings where the first character is one of "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS". After executing `input()`, a string representing the input for the next steps is read and stored in the variable `t`.**

In this output state, the variable `t` now holds the input value from the user, which is expected to be an integer within the range 1 to 100. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, the trump suit, and the card descriptions.
