Output State: **`todo` is a set containing integers from the input split and converted to integers, `num_test_cases` is the number of test cases, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `todo = set(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a set from these integers. This set replaces the existing value of the variable `todo`. The values of `num_test_cases`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
