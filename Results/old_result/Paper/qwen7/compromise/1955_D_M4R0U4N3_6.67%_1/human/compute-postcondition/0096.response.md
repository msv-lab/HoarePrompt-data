Output State: **`j` is 0; `todo` is the list with the element at index `j` removed.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `j` from the list `todo`. Since `j` is 0, the first element of the list `todo` is removed. The value of `j` remains unchanged as the code only modifies the list `todo`.
