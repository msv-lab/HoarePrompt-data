Postcondition: `j` is 0. If the element at index `j` in `a` is in the list `todo`, then `todo` is the list with the element at index `j` removed, and `done` contains the element `a[j]`. If the element at index `j` in `a` is not in the list `todo`, then `a` is a list of integers with the first element moved to `extra`.
