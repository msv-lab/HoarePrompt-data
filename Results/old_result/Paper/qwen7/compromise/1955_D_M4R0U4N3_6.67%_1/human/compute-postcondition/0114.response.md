Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `m-1`. The variable `todo` will contain the elements of `a` that were not added to `done`. The set `done` will contain all unique elements from `a` that were present in `todo` during the loop's execution. The set `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not found in `todo` and were not already in `extra`. The variable `ans` will be 1 if the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it will be 0.**

The code `ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0` does not change the values of `j`, `todo`, `done`, or `extra`. It only updates the value of `ans` based on the condition that checks if the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the value of `ans`, which is now determined by the condition.
