Output State: **`extra` now contains `a[r]`, `old` retains the value of `a[r - m]`, `a[r - m]` retains its original value, `todo` and `done` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. The other variables (`old`, `a[r - m]`, `todo`, and `done`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.
