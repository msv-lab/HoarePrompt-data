Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` - 1, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `old` is no longer in `done`.**

Explanation: The line `done.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `done`. This operation does not affect the value of `ans`, `r`, or `old`. However, since `old` is no longer in `done`, the condition for `ans` will be checked again with one less element in `done`.
