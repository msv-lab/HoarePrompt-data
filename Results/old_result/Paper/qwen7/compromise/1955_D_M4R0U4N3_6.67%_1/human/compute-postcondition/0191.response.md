Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers without the element `a[j]`, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[j]` (which is `a[0]` since `j` is 0) to the set `done`. All other variables remain unchanged. After adding `a[0]` to `done`, `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
