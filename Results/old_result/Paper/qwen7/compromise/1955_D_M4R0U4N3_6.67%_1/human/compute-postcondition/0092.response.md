Output State: **`n` is the input integer minus 1, `m` is the input integer `m`, `k` is the input integer `k`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is the last element processed in the loop, `extra` contains all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and hence added to `extra` during the loop, `done` is an empty set, `todo` is now a set of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `done` as an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `done` is updated to an empty set, while the other variables retain their original values and conditions.
