Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `m`, `todo` will contain none of the elements from `a` that were initially in `todo` and not removed during the loop, `done` will contain all elements from `a` that were removed from `todo`, and `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and hence added to `extra` during the loop; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `old` remains in `extra` and `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo` and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `old` is removed from `extra` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `old` remains in `extra` and `done` unchanged, and `extra` includes `a[r]` while `done` includes `old`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is either no longer in `extra` or is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` either does not include `a[r - m]` or includes `a[r - m]`, `done` is `done` plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` is in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is `m + 2`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` are such that if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if the length of `done` is at least `k`, and `done` is reduced by `old` if `old` was present. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`, `done` remains unchanged if `old` is in `done`, otherwise `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if the length of `done` is at least `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
