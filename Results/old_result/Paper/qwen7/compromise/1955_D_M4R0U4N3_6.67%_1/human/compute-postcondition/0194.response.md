Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[j]` is in `todo`.
