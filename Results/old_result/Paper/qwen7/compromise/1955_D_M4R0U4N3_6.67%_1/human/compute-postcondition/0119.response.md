Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, and `old` is in `extra`, `extra` does not contain `old`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` was previously in `extra`, after executing `extra.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer in `extra`. All other variables (`r`, `m`, `n`, and `old`) remain unchanged.
