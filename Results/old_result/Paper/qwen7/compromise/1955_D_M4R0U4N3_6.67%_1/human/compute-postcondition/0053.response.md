Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `old` remains in `extra` and `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `old` is removed from `extra` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `old` remains in `extra` and `done` unchanged, and `extra` includes `a[r]` while `done` includes `old`. Additionally, the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables `r`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` after the execution of the if-else block. It covers both the case when the condition `len(done) >= k` is true and when it is false (though the else part is not provided, the postcondition for the if part is still valid).
