Output State: **`todo` is a set containing integers from the input split and converted to integers, `num_test_cases` is the number of test cases, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty set named `done`. This does not affect the values of `todo`, `num_test_cases`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `done` is updated to be an empty set.
