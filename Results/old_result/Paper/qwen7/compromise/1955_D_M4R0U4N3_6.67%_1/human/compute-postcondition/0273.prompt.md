Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `a` is a list of integers, `m` is equal to the length of `a`, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing all elements from `todo` that were found in `a`, and `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not found in `todo`.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `old`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, and `done` now contains `a[r]` with one element removed from `todo`; if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `ans` remains unchanged, `todo` does not contain `old`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, and `extra` contains `a[r]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 1; `r` is `m + 1`; if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` and `done` each contain `a[r]`; otherwise, `extra` contains `a[r]`, and if `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` has had `old` removed from it. Otherwise, `todo` contains `old`, and `done` has removed `old` if `old` was in `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `old` remains unchanged, `a[r - m]` retains its original value, and `todo` and `done` remain unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `extra`, then `old` is removed from `extra`, and `a[r - m]` is no longer stored in `old`. If `a[r]` is in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `old`, `todo` contains `old` added, and `a[r - m]` retains its original value. If `a[r]` is not in `done`, `extra`, or `todo`, then `a[r - m]` retains its original value and `todo` and `done` remain unchanged. Additionally, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `len(done) >= k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
