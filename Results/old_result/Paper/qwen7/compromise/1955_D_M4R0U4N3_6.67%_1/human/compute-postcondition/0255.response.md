Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for r in range(m, n)`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `r`.

2. **Determine the New Value of `r`:**
   At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is `m + 1`. Since the loop increments `r` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `r` will be `m + 2`.

3. **Check the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `r < n`.
   - We need to ensure that `r` is within the range `[m, n)`.

Given the conditions and the values at the end of the previous iteration:
- `r` is `m + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `r` needs to be `m + 2`.

Therefore, we need to update the state with the new value of `r`.

**Final State:**
State: **`ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 1; `r` is `m + 2`; if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` and `done` each contain `a[r]`; otherwise, `extra` contains `a[r]`, and if `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` has had `old` removed from it. Otherwise, `todo` contains `old`, and `done` has removed `old` if `old` was in `done`.**
