Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(m)`. The only variable here is `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j < m`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - Postcondition: If `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `todo` list has removed the element `a[0]`, and `done` set has added the element `a[0]`. Otherwise, `a[0]` is added to `extra`, and `a[0]` is not in `todo`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0 and the loop condition is `j < m`, the next iteration will occur if `m > 0` (which is already given).
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `m` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The postcondition for `a[0]` remains the same because it does not depend on the loop variable `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, if `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `todo` list has removed the element `a[0]`, and `done` set has added the element `a[0]`. Otherwise, `a[0]` is added to `extra`, and `a[0]` is not in `todo`.**
