Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `extra` now contains the element `a[r]`, `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Since `r` is defined as `m + 1`, the value of `r` remains `m + 1`. The values of `m`, `n`, `done`, and `todo` do not change. Therefore, the updated state includes the addition of `a[r]` to `extra`.
