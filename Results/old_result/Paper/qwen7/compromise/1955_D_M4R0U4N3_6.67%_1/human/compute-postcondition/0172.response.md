Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `extra` now contains `a[r]`, `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Since `r` is defined as `m + 1`, `a[r]` is effectively `a[m + 1]`. The values of `m`, `n`, `done`, and `todo` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
