Output State: **`j` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed, `done` now contains `a[0]`, and `extra` is empty.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[0]` (since `j` is 1, `a[j]` refers to `a[0]`) to the set `done`. The initial state indicates that `a[0]` might or might not be in `todo` and `extra`. Since `a[0]` is added to `done`, it is no longer in `extra` and is removed from `todo`. The value of `j` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
