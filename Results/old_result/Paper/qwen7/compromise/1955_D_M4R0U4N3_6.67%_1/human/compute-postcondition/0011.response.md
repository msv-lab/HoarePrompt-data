Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `a[j]` is added to `extra`, and `a[j]` is not in `todo`**.

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Given that `j` is initially 0, `a[j]` refers to the first element in the list `a`. The condition that `m` must be greater than 0 and `a[j]` is not in `todo` remains unchanged.
