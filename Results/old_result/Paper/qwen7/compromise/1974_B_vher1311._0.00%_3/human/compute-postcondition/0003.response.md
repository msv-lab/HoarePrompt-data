Output State: `i` is `len(unique_chars)`, `j` is `-1`.

Explanation: After iterating through each character in `s`, the loop will either replace a character with the last element of `unique_chars` or insert the character into `unique_chars`. Since the loop decreases `j` for each replacement and increases `i` and `j` for each insertion, `j` will eventually become -1 when there are no more characters to process. The value of `i` will be equal to the length of `unique_chars` because every new character inserted increments `i` by 1.
