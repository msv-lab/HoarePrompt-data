Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. The function `func_1` is intended to decode the string but it actually encodes the string instead. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Function Purpose Mismatch**: The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `s` back to the original string `s`. However, the implementation in `func_1` is designed to encode the string by replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding character from the sorted unique characters list. This is evident from the logic where characters are being replaced and indices are being adjusted.

2. **Indices Adjustment**: The indices `i` and `j` are used to insert new characters into the `unique_chars` list. This is not part of the decoding process but rather seems to be an attempt to handle characters not present in the initial set of unique characters. However, the logic here is flawed because it does not correctly map the characters back to their original positions.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the modified `unique_chars` list as a string, which is not the expected output for decoding.

Given these points, the program does not perform the required decoding operation and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
