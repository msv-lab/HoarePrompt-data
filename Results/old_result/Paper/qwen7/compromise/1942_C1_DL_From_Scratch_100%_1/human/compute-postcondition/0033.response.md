Output State: **`count` is equal to `x`, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is the second input integer, `x` is the third input integer, `y` is the first input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `i` is `x-2`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The other variables (`count`, `T`, `list0`, `i`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
