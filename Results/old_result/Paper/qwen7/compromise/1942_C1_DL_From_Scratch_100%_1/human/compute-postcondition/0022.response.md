Postcondition: **`count` is 3, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `i` is 3, `num` is `list0[4] - list0[3] - 1** and if `num` equals 1, then `count` is incremented by 1.
