Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is defined as `x - 1`.
   - `num` is defined as `- (x - 2) + list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.
   - `count` is defined as `x - 2`.

2. **Simplifying `num`:**
   - We need to simplify the expression for `num`:
     \[
     num = - (x - 2) + list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
     \]
     Simplifying further:
     \[
     num = -x + 2 + list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
     \]
     \[
     num = -x + 1 + list0[0] + n - list0[-1]
     \]

3. **Conditions for `num`:**
   - If `num` equals 1, then `num` remains 1.
   - Otherwise, the value of `num` remains as calculated above.

4. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression to print is `count + x - 2`.

5. **Substituting the Values:**
   - From the definition of `count`, we know `count = x - 2`.
   - Therefore, `count + x - 2` simplifies to:
     \[
     count + x - 2 = (x - 2) + x - 2 = 2x - 4
     \]

6. **Final Output:**
   - Since the value of `count + x - 2` is `2x - 4`, this is what will be printed.

Output: **2x - 4**
