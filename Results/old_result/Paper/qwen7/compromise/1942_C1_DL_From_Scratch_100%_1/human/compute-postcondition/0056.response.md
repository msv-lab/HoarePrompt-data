Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, `count` is `count + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1. Since `num` is currently 1, the count of times `num` equals 1 during the loop execution increases by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
