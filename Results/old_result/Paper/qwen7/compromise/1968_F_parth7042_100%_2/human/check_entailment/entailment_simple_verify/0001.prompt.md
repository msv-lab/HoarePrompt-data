You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the input to extract the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `q` are extracted, representing the length of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
   - Arrays `a` and `pf` are initialized to store the original array and prefix XOR values, respectively.
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to map prefix XOR values to their indices.

3. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is calculated such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - Each prefix XOR value is stored in the dictionary `mp`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR value of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If this XOR value is zero, the subarray is considered interesting, and "YES" is appended to the results.
   - Otherwise, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the dictionary `mp` to check if the subarray can be divided into two parts with equal XOR values.
   - If the conditions are met, "YES" is appended; otherwise, "NO" is appended.

5. **Output:**
   - The results are printed as a single string with each result separated by a newline.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the prefix XOR and checking the subarray's interesting property is correct.
- The use of binary search to find the appropriate indices in the dictionary `mp` is appropriate for determining if the subarray can be divided into two parts with equal XOR values.
- The overall structure and flow of the program align with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
