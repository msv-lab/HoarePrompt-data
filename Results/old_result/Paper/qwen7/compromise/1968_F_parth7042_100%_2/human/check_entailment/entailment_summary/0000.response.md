Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input data and processes each test case.
2. It initializes necessary variables and structures like `a`, `pf` (prefix XOR array), and `mp` (dictionary to map prefix XOR values to their indices).
3. For each query, it computes the XOR value of the subarray defined by the query range and checks if this value is zero.
4. If the XOR value is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating the subarray is interesting.
5. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.
6. The logic for checking if the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values is sound, using binary search (`bisect_left`) to find appropriate indices.
7. The program handles multiple test cases and queries efficiently within the given constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to implement the solution correctly according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
