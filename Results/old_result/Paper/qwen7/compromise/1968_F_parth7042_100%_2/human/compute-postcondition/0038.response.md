Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and if `x` is 0, `results` now contains 'YES' and `index` is incremented by 3.
