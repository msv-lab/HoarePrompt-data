Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`; `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in the range of `v1` up to the end, or the position where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted.**

Explanation: The `bisect_left` function returns the index of the first occurrence of `l` in the list `v1` (or the position where `l` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order). Since the exact values of `v1` are not provided, `it1` is expressed in terms of the operation performed.
