Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.

5. **Determine the new state**: Since the only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it needs to be 3 for the loop to continue, the new state should reflect this change.

Given the information provided, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3**
