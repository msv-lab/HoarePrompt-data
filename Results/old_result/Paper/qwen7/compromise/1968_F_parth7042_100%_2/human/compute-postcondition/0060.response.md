Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1`, `index` is `index + 8`, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains 'YES', `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: The code uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point of `l` in `v1`. This operation does not change the values of the other variables, but it calculates the position `it1` where `l` should be inserted in `v1` to maintain the sorted order. Therefore, `it1` is updated with this new value while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
