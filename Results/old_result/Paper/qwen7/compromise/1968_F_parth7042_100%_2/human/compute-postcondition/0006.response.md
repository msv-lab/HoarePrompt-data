Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `n` is now an integer derived from the specified index in the `data` list.
