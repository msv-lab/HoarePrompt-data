Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `v2` the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`. No other changes occur to the variables. The conditions and values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, and the contents of `results` remain as they were before the code was executed.
