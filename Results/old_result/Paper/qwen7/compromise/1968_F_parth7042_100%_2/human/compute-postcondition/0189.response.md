Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', `index` is index + 3, `l` is data[index - 4], `r` is int(data[index - 2]), and `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends 'YES' to the list `results`. It does not affect the values of `index`, `l`, `r`, or `x` directly, but it updates the state of `results` by adding 'YES'. The values of `index`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain as they were before the execution of this line of code, except that `index` is incremented by 3.
