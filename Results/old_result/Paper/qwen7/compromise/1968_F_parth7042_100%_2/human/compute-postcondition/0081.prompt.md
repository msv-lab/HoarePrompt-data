Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by the total number of iterations (which is `n + 1`), `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with integers from `data[index - (n + 1) + 1]` to `data[index]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` and `q` retain their initial values, and `index` will be increased by `n + 1`. The list `a` will contain the integers from `data[index - (n + 1) + 1]` to `data[index]`. The list `pf` will store cumulative XOR results of elements in `a`. The dictionary `mp` will map each unique value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value occurs in `pf`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 6, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, and `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]` is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1`, `index` is `index + 8`, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted; if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, `results` contains 'YES'; otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` now contains 'YES' more than before, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1 - 1`, `index` is `index + 10`, `l` is now `int(data[index])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then 'NO' is added to `results`; otherwise, 'NO' may or may not be added to `results`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
