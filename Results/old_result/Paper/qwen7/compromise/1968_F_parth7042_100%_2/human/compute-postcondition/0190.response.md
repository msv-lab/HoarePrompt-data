Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', `index` is index + 3, `l` is data[index - 4], `r` is int(data[index - 2]), and `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
