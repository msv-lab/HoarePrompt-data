Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1 - 1`, `index` is `index + 8`, `l` is now `int(data[index])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `r` is updated to `int(data[index + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to `int(data[index + 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
