Output State: **`data[index]' is assigned to `l', index is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `l = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `l`. It also increments the `index` by 1 to move to the next element in the list `data`. The initial state of `i`, `index`, `pf`, or `mp` remains unchanged, but `l` is now assigned the integer value of the element at the current `index` in `data`, and `index` is incremented.
