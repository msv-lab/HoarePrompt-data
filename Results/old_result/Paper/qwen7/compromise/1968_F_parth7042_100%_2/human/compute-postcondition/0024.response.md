Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 8 (since `i` was 7 and was incremented by 1), `a[8]` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `pf[8]` is `pf[7]` ^ `a[8]`, `mp[pf[8]]` is a list containing the value 7.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged because no operation affects it.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged because no operation affects it.
- The value of `q` remains unchanged because no operation affects it.
- The value of `index` is increased by 4, so `index` is now `index + 4`.
- The value of `a` remains a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, except for the new value `a[8]` which is set to the integer value from `data[index]`.
- The value of `pf` remains a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, except for the new value `pf[8]` which is calculated as `pf[7]` ^ `a[8]`.
- The value of `mp` remains a defaultdict where all values are lists, and `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0. Additionally, `mp[pf[8]]` is updated to include the value 7.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 8.
