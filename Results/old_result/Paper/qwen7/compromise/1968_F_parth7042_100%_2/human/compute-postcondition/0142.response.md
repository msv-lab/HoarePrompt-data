Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is unchanged as an integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `x` is unchanged as the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is unchanged as assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is unchanged as assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is unchanged as the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is unchanged as the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is unchanged as `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**.

This output state reflects that the only change made by the code is assigning `l` to the integer value of `data[index]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
