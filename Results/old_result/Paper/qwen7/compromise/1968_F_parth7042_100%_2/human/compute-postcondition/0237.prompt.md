Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    q = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = defaultdict(list)
    mp[0].append(0)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[index])
        r = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp[pf[r]]
        v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
        it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` retains its final value from the last iteration, `q` is reduced by the total number of iterations (which is `n + 1`), `index` is increased by `n + 1`, `l` and `r` are the integers from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` respectively, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, and `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. The `results` list will contain 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `q` must be a positive integer representing the total number of iterations. The variable `index` has been incremented by `2 * q`, making it equal to its initial value plus twice the total number of iterations. `l` and `r` have been updated `q` times, taking their respective integer values from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` each time. The variable `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` for each iteration. The lists `v1` and `v2` are reassigned the values of `mp[pf[r]]` and `mp[pf[l - 1]]` respectively after each iteration. The variable `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, and `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. The list `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' appended based on the conditions met during each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final output state will contain 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for all q queries.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
