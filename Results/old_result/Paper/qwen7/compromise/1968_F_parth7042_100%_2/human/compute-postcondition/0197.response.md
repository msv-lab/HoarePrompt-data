Postcondition: **`results` contains 'YES', `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index - 4]`, `r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index - 2])`, `x` is 0, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`, `it2` is the value of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. The condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` is true.**
