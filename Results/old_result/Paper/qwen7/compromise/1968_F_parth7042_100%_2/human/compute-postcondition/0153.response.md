Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `v1` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `it2` is now `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, `results` contains 'YES', `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `results` now contains 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contained 'YES', after appending another 'YES', `results` now contains two 'YES' elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
