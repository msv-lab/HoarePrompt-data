Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2.**

The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables are as stated in the initial state, with the additional information that `index` has been increased by 2.
