Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 2, `a[i]` is an integer value from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was increased by 2, so now it is increased by 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
