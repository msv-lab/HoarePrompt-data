Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and the value of `x` is 0, `results` now contains 'YES' and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement.
