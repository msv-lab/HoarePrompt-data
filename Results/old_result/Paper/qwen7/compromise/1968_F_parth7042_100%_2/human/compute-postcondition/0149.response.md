Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is unchanged as the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains 'YES', `it1` is unchanged as the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is unchanged as `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `v1` to `mp[pf[r]]`. Since `x` is calculated as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous states.
