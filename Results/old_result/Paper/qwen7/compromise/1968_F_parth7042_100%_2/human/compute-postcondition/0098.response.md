Output State: **`i` is 3; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `pf[3]` is calculated as `pf[2] ^ a[3]`. The other variables (`i` and `index`) are not directly affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged as per the initial state.
