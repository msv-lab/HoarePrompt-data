Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` inserts the value of `l` into the list `v1` while maintaining the sorted order. The function `bisect_left` returns the index where `l` should be inserted. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
