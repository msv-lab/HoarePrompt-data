Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `index` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `index` is increased by 2.
