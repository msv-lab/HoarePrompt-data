Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index - 4]`, `r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index - 2])`, `x` is 0, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` calculates the index of the leftmost position where the value `l` can be inserted into the sorted list `v1` without violating the order. This value is assigned to `it1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
