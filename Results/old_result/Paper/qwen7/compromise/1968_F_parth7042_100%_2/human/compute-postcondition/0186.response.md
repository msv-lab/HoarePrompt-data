Output State: **`l` is assigned the value of `data[index - 4]`, `index` is incremented by 3 to `index + 3`, `r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index - 2])`, and `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: Initially, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is incremented by 3, and `r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index - 1])`. After these operations, the new value of `index` is `index + 3`. The code then assigns `x` the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described.
