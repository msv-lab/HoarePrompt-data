Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 3, `pf[3]` is `pf[2]` ^ `a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]]` is a list containing the value 3.**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `mp[pf[3]]`. Since `pf[3]` is `pf[2]` ^ `a[3]`, and `a[3]` is 0 (as `a` is a list of zeros), `pf[3]` remains unchanged from its previous value. However, since the exact previous value of `pf[3]` is not specified, we know that `mp[pf[3]]` now contains the value 3. All other variables remain in their initial or updated states as described.
