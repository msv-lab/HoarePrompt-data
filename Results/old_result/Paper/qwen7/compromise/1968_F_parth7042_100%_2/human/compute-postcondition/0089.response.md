Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `q` is `q - (n + 1) - int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `l` is `data[index]`, `r` is `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is initialized as a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `mp` is initialized as a `defaultdict(list)`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[0]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[0]`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, and `it2` is `-1`.**

Explanation:
- `mp[0].append(0)` appends `0` to the list associated with key `0` in the dictionary `mp`. Since `mp` was initialized as a `defaultdict(list)`, it defaults to an empty list when accessed with a non-existent key. Thus, `mp[0]` becomes `[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `a`, `pf`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
