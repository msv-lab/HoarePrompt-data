You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) (where \( 1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9 \)). For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of an arithmetic sequence or a simple product based on the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Specifically, if \( b > a \), it computes the sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) with a common difference of 1, plus the product of \( a \) and the remaining terms, where \( k \) is the minimum value between \( n \) and \( b - a \). If \( b \le a \), it simply prints \( a \times n \). The function outputs the results for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculating `k`:**
   - `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - This ensures that `k` is the minimum between the number of buns `n` and the difference between the special price `b` and the usual price `a`.

3. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `a * n`. 
     - This means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best option since the special price `b` is not beneficial.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit using the formula:
     - `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`
     - This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and adds the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

### Verification

1. **Case when \( b \leq a \):**
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly prints `a * n`, which is the total profit from selling all buns at the usual price.

2. **Case when \( b > a \):**
   - The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a` is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` with a common difference of `-1` is:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1))
     \]
   - Adding the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` gives:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1)) + (n - k) \times a
     \]

### Example Verification

Let's verify the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \)
  - \( k = \min(4, 5 - 4) = 1 \)
  - Profit: \( 5 + 4 \times 3 = 5 + 12 = 17 \)
  - The program outputs `17`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
  - \( k = \min(5, 9 - 5) = 4 \)
  - Profit: \( (9 + 5) / 2 \times 4 + 1 \times 5 = 7 \times 4 + 5 = 28 + 5 = 35 \)
  - The program outputs `35`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), \( b = 5 \)
  - \( k = \min(10, 5 - 10) = 0 \)
  - Profit: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)
  - The program outputs `100`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
