Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it takes three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (with 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) as inputs. It performs some operation based on these inputs for each test case and returns the results accordingly.**

This means the function does not take any parameters when called directly but handles multiple sets of inputs (`n`, `a`, `b`) in a loop, processing each set according to specified rules and returning the results for each test case.
