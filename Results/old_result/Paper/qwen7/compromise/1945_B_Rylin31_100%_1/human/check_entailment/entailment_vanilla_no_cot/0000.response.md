Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula used in the program `m // a + m // b + 2` does not account for the overlapping visibility period of the fireworks. 

To solve this problem accurately, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to understand the periodicity of when both installations launch fireworks at the same time. Then, we need to calculate how many fireworks can be seen at any given moment considering their visibility period.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate LCM of a and b
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of intervals of length lcm_ab within the visibility period m
        max_visible = (m // lcm_ab) * 2 + min(m % lcm_ab, a - 1) + min(m % lcm_ab, b - 1) + 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the LCM of `a` and `b`, then determines how many fireworks can be seen simultaneously by considering the periodicity and the visibility period.
