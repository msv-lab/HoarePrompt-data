### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a matrix `mat` of size `n x n` where each row is a permutation of the sequence from 1 to `n`.
   - This initialization is done using `mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]`.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a value `res` using the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) summed over all rows.
   - This calculation is incorrect and does not align with the problem statement. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix through specific operations, not through a fixed formula.

4. **Operation Execution**:
   - The program prints the calculated sum `res` and `2 * n` (which is the number of operations).
   - It then prints two sequences of numbers from 1 to `n` for each row in reverse order.
   - These operations are performed independently for each row and do not involve column operations.

5. **Problem Statement Analysis**:
   - The problem allows for two types of operations: operations on rows and operations on columns.
   - The program only performs row operations and does not consider column operations.
   - The provided example in the original assessment demonstrates that column operations are necessary to achieve the maximum sum.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - Consider a 2x2 matrix:
     ```
     1 2
     3 4
     ```
   - The maximum sum achievable through the allowed operations is:
     - Row operation: `1 2` → `2 1`
     - Column operation: `2 1` → `4 3`
     - Resulting matrix:
       ```
       4 3
       2 1
       ```
     - Sum: `4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10`
   - The program, however, only performs row operations and does not achieve this sum.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem statement. It only performs row operations and does not consider column operations, which are necessary to achieve the maximum sum in some cases.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
