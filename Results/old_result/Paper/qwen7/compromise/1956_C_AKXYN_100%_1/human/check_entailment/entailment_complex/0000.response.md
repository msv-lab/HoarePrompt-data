Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix \(a\) using at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation can either permute the elements of a row or a column.
2. The provided code does not actually perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Instead, it initializes a matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \(n\) in each row and then calculates a sum `res` using a specific formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\).
3. The formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) is not related to the problem's requirements and does not reflect the actual sum of the matrix after performing the allowed operations.
4. The code then prints the calculated `res` and \(2n\), followed by printing the sequence of numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each row in reverse order. This part of the code does not correspond to the actual operations needed to maximize the sum of the matrix.
5. The provided example output shows that the code does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix. For instance, for \(n = 2\), the correct maximum sum would be 16 (by setting the matrix to \(\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\)), but the code outputs 7, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the provided code does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
