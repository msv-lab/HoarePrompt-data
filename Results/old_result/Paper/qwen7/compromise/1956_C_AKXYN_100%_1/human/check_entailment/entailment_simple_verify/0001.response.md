### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each element \( a_{i,j} \) in the matrix can be set to any value from 1 to \( n \).
   - Two types of operations are allowed:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix elements and prints the result along with the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - The sum of the matrix after initializing it with the sequence from 1 to \( n \) in each row is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i \times n) = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - This is indeed the maximum possible sum because each element can be at most \( n \).
   - However, the solution does not actually perform the operations as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply initializes the matrix with the sequence from 1 to \( n \) and then prints the sum and the number of operations without performing any actual permutations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly by setting the single element to 1.
   - For \( n > 1 \), the solution sets each row and column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \), but it does not perform the permutations as required by the problem statement. It merely initializes the matrix and prints the result.

5. **Verification Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the matrix is initialized correctly but does not show any actual permutations being performed.
   - The loop that prints the operations does not reflect any actual changes to the matrix, as the matrix is already initialized correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not perform the required operations as described in the problem statement. It merely initializes the matrix and prints the result without performing any actual permutations.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
