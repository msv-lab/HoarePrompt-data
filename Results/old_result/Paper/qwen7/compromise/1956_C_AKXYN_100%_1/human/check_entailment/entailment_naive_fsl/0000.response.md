Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program initializes the matrix `mat` such that each row is a permutation of the sequence from 1 to n. However, the problem allows for two types of operations: operations on rows and operations on columns independently. The program only performs operations on rows and does not consider column operations.

To illustrate, let's consider a 2x2 matrix. According to the problem, we can achieve the maximum sum by performing both row and column operations. Here is an example:

- Initial matrix:
```
1 2
3 4
```
- After applying the operations:
  - Row operation: `1 2` → `2 1`
  - Column operation: `2 1` → `4 3`

This would result in the matrix:
```
4 3
2 1
```
The sum of this matrix is `4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10`.

However, the program only performs row operations and does not consider column operations. Therefore, it will not achieve the maximum possible sum for matrices where column operations are necessary.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
