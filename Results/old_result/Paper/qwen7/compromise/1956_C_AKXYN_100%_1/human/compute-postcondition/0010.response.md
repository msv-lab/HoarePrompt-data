Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect on the variable `res`. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, and in each iteration, it adds `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to `res`.

Given the pattern:
- After 1 iteration (`i = 0`), `res` becomes \(1\).
- After 2 iterations (`i = 1`), `res` becomes \(1 + 3 = 4\).
- After 3 iterations (`i = 2`), `res` becomes \(1 + 3 + 9 = 13\).

Following this pattern, we can see that after `n` iterations, `res` will be the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

For `n = 4`:
- When `i = 0`, `res` is \(1\).
- When `i = 1`, `res` is \(1 + 3 = 4\).
- When `i = 2`, `res` is \(1 + 3 + 9 = 13\).
- When `i = 3`, `res` is \(1 + 3 + 9 + 21 = 34\).

Continuing this:
- When `i = 4`, `res` is \(1 + 3 + 9 + 21 + 35 = 70\).

And so on, until `n = 13`:
\[1 + 3 + 9 + 21 + 35 + 51 + 70 + 92 + 117 + 145 + 176 + 210 + 247 = 1240 - 1036 = 204.\]

Thus, after all iterations, `res` will be 204, assuming `n` is at least 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i`) remain as described in the final iteration's state.
