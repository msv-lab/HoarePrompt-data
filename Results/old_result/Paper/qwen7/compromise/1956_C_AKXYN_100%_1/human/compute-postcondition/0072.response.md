Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 1, `i` is 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 1.

Explanation: After analyzing the provided outputs, we can deduce that the loop reduces `n` until it reaches 1. The calculation for `res` is consistent across the iterations, indicating that once `n` is reduced to 1, `res` remains at 204. The loop then prints `res` and `n << 1` (which is 2 for `n=1`), and since `n` is now 1, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be 1, `i` will be 0, and `res` will be 204. The matrix `mat` will also be reduced to a single list containing the integers from 1 to 1.
