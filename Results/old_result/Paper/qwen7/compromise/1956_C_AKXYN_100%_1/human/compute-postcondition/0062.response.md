Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is 204 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) (also not used in the print statement).
- `n` is 6.
- `i` is 5.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down:

1. `'1 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i`, which is 5. So, `'1 %d' % i` becomes `'1 5'`.
2. `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object into separate arguments. Since `n` is 6, `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output:
```
1 5 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

Output: **1 5 1 2 3 4 5 6**
