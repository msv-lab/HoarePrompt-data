Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head; it starts at 0 (the default value for the `range` function).
   - `n` is an input integer, and its value is not specified in the given state.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` starts at 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`. However, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`res` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to n, `i` is 0**
