Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `res` is explicitly given as 140.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). Since no specific value is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`.
   - `n` is explicitly given as 7.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 6.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement uses string formatting. Here, `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and `i` is the integer 6. So, this part will be formatted as `'1 6'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Given that `n` is 7, `range(1, 8)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into separate arguments for the print statement.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Combining both parts, the print statement will output: `'1 6'` followed by the numbers from 1 to 7 separated by spaces.

Output: **'1 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7'**
