Output State: **`res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `res`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
