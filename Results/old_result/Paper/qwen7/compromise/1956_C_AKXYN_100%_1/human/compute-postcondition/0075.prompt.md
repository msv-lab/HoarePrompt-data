You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        
        print(res, n << 1)
        
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 1, `i` is 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 1.
    #
    #Explanation: After analyzing the provided output states, we can infer the behavior of the loop. The variable `res` is calculated based on the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) and summed up for each iteration. The variable `n` decreases with each iteration until it reaches 1. Once `n` is 1, the loop terminates because the inner loop runs from `n` down to 1, and when `i` becomes 0, the condition `i > 0` fails, stopping the loop.
    #
    #Given the output state after 3 iterations, we know that `n` was 6 initially and decreased to 1 after 3 iterations. Since the loop processes each `n` independently and `n` is reduced to 1 after 3 iterations, the final state will be when `n` is 1, and `i` is 0. At this point, `res` will be the cumulative sum calculated during the last iteration when `n` was 6, which is 140. The matrix `mat` will be a single list containing integers from 1 to 1, as `n` is now 1. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. The integer t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some operation (not specified here) and returns the result based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
