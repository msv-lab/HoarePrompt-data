Based on the initial state and the calculation provided, we know that:

- `res` is 204.
- `n` is 6.
- The expression `n << 1` means `n` left-shifted by 1 bit, which is equivalent to `n * 2`.

Given these values, the expression `n << 1` will result in `6 * 2 = 12`.

Therefore, the `print(res, n << 1)` statement will print the values of `res` and `n << 1`.

Output: **204, 12**
