Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is explicitly given as 204.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-1`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of this statement:

1. `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the string uses Python's string formatting to insert the value of `i` into the string. Since `i` is an integer and must be between 0 and `n-1`, let's denote it as `i_value`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) into separate arguments for the `print` function. For example, if `n` is 5, this would expand to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

Given these components, the `print` statement will output a string that starts with "2" followed by a space and then the value of `i`, followed by a space-separated sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Since the exact values of `i` and `n` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 [i_value] 1 2 ... (n-1) n** (where `[i_value]` is the value of `i` and `n` is the value of `n`)
