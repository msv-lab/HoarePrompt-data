Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is 140
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` must be 7
- `i` is `n`

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the string uses string formatting. Since `i` is equal to `n` and `n` is 7, `i` is 7. Therefore, this part becomes `'1 7'`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range function into individual arguments. Since `n` is 7, `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. When unpacked, it will be treated as separate arguments.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
```
1 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

Output: **1 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7**
