Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
    print(res, n << 1)
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be exactly 1, `i` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 499, and after three iterations, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-1`, it means that `n` has been reduced to 1 after the loop completes. When `n` becomes 1, the loop terminates because `i` would then be 0, which is not greater than 0. Therefore, the final state of `n` is 1, and `i` is 0. The values of `res` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: res is 140, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), n is 7, i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
