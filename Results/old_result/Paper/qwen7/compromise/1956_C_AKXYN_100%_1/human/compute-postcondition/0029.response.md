Output State: **`res` is (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given the initial value of `i` is 1, the expression evaluates to `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Thus, `res` becomes 6. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is now incremented to 2.
