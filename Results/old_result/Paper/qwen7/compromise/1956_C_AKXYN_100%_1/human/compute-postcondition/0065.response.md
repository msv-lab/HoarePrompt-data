Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is 204 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) (though this variable is also not used in the print statement).
- `n` is 6.
- `i` is 4.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `'1 %d' % i`: This part formats a string where `%d` is replaced by the value of `i`. Since `i` is 4, this becomes `'1 4'`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range function, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n + 1 - 1`, which is 7. So, `range(1, n + 1)` produces `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output the string `'1 4'` followed by the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 4 1 2 3 4 5 6**
