Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. The integer t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some operation (not specified here) and returns the result based on the given constraints.**

Note: The specific operations to be performed on t and n within each test case are not detailed in the provided information.
