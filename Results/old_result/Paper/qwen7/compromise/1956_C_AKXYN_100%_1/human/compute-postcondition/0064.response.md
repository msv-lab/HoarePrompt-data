Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs in reverse order from `n` to `1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5 and `n` is 6.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1`. Therefore, if `i` was 5, the next value of `i` will be 4.

4. **Check if the loop should continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is now 4, which is still greater than or equal to 1, the loop will continue.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state to reflect the new value of `i` and ensure that the other variables remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 4, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6**
