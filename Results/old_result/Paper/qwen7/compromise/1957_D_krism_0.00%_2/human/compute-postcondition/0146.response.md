Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is 2, `pre[2][0]` is 1**

Explanation: Initially, `j` is 1. The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value at `pre[1][0]` by 1. Since `j` is 1, `pre[1][0]` becomes 1. After this operation, `j` is incremented to 2 (as per the initial condition given). Therefore, `j` is now 2, and `pre[2][0]` is 1.
