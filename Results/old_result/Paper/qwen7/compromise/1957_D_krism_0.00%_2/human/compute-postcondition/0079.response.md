Output State: **`i` is 30; `j` is 0; `suf[j][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the first element of the list `suf[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, it means `suf[0][0]` is incremented by 1. Since `suf` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a list of lists. Initially, `suf[0][0]` is 0 (as it's not specified otherwise), so after the operation, `suf[0][0]` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
