Output State: **`i` is 32, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[32]`, `j` is 0, `suf[0][0]` is 1, and `(cur >> j & 1)` is false**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, `suf[0][0]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
