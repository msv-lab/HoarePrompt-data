Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is 32; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 5; `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`; `c` is `prefix[1]` with the least significant bit at position `j` being 1; `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1.**

The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, `pre[j][1]` which was initially part of the initial state, is now increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
