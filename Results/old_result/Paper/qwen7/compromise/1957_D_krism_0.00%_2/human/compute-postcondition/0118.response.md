Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` is 32; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 5; `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`; `c` is `prefix[1]`; `pre[2][0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `suf[2][0]` is decremented by 1. Since `pre[2][0]` was initially 1, after decrementing `suf[2][0]` by 1, `pre[2][0]` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
