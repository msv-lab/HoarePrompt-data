Output State: **`j` is 31, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[31]`, `k` is `arr[31].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `i` is 32**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of `y.bit_length() - 1`. Since `y` is equal to `arr[31]`, `k` is now `arr[31].bit_length() - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
