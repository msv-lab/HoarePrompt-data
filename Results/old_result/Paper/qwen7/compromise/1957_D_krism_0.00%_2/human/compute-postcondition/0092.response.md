Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `ans` is 0, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of 1s in the binary representation of all numbers from 0 to 31 up to and including the `j`-th bit, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of 0s in the same range.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `cur`, and the arrays `prefix` and `suf` remain unchanged.
