Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n` to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order, as indicated by the range `range(n, 0, -1)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 32
   - `n` is 32
   - `cur` is `prefix[32]`
   - `j` is 31
   - `suf` is an array where each element `suf[j]` is a list containing two integers.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs in reverse order, the next value of `i` should be one less than its current value.
   - The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is 32, so the next value of `i` will be 31.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 31.
   - `n` will remain 32.
   - `cur` and `suf` do not change because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[32]`, `j` is 31, `suf` is an array where each element `suf[j]` is a list containing two integers.**
