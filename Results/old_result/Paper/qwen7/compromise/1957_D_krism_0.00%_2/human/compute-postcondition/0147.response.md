Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is 2, `pre[2][0]` is 1, `suf[2][0]` is -1**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `suf[2][0]` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `suf[2][0]` was 1, after the operation, it becomes 0 - 1 = -1. The values of `c`, `j`, and `pre[2][0]` remain unchanged.
