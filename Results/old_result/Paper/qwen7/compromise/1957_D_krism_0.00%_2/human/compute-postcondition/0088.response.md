Output State: `i` is 30, `j` is 31, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.

This means that after the loop has executed all 32 iterations (from `j = 0` to `j = 31`), the variable `j` will be 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will hold the number of 1s in the bits from position `j` to 31 in the binary representation of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` will hold the number of 0s in the same range.
