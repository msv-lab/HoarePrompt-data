Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, which ranges from `0` to `31`.

2. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 31
   - `n` is 32
   - `cur` is `prefix[31]`
   - `j` is 0 (at the end of the previous iteration)
   - `suf` is an array where each element `suf[j]` is a list containing two integers. Based on the previous iteration, if `cur >> j & 1` is true, then `suf[0][1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is set to 1.

3. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to 31, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.
   - The value of `cur >> j & 1` will be checked again for `j = 1`.
   - Depending on the result of `cur >> 1 & 1`, either `suf[0][1]` will be increased by 1 or `suf[0][0]` will be set to 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `cur` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` will be updated to 1.
   - `suf` will be updated based on the condition `cur >> 1 & 1`.

Given the condition, let's assume the condition `cur >> 1 & 1` is true (the actual value of `cur` is not provided, but we need to consider both cases):

- If `cur >> 1 & 1` is true, then `suf[0][1]` will be increased by 1.
- If `cur >> 1 & 1` is false, then `suf[0][0]` will be set to 1.

Since we don't know the exact value of `cur`, we will provide both possible states:

**State:**
- `i` is 31
- `n` is 32
- `cur` is `prefix[31]`
- `j` is 1
- `suf` is an array where `suf[0][1]` is increased by 1 (if `cur >> 1 & 1` is true) or `suf[0][0]` is set to 1 (if `cur >> 1 & 1` is false).

For clarity, let's present the states separately:

**State 1:**
- `i` is 31
- `n` is 32
- `cur` is `prefix[31]`
- `j` is 1
- `suf[0][1]` is increased by 1

**State 2:**
- `i` is 31
- `n` is 32
- `cur` is `prefix[31]`
- `j` is 1
- `suf[0][0]` is set to 1

Since we need to provide a single state, we can combine these into a general form:

**State:**
- `i` is 31
- `n` is 32
- `cur` is `prefix[31]`
- `j` is 1
- `suf[0][1]` is increased by 1 (or `suf[0][0]` is set to 1, depending on the condition)

To be precise, we should keep both possibilities:

**State:**
- `i` is 31
- `n` is 32
- `cur` is `prefix[31]`
- `j` is 1
- `suf[0][1]` is increased by 1 (or `suf[0][0]` is set to 1, depending on the condition)
