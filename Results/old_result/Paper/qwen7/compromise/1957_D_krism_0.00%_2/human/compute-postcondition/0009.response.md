Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing the integer 0, another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, and an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, and now `prefix` has an extra element which is `v ^ prefix[-1]`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `prefix` list, which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`. Since `prefix[-1]` was already the last element before the append operation, the new element added to `prefix` is `v ^ (v ^ prefix[-1])`, which simplifies to `prefix[-1]` due to the properties of the XOR operation (i.e., `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`). Therefore, `prefix` gains an additional element that is the same as the second last element in the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
