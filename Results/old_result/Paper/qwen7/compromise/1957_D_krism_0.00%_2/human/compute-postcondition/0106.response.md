Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`. If the least significant bit at position `j` of `c` is 1, then `suf[0][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pre[0][0]` is set to 1 and `suf[0][0]` is decreased by 1.
