Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` is 32; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 5; `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`; `c` is `prefix[1]`; `pre[1][0]` is increased by 1; `suf[2][0]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `suf[2][0]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
