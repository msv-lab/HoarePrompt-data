Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `pre[2][1]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `pre[2][1]` is incremented from its initial value (which was 1) to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
