### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties is `x` and the GCD of these difficulties is maximized.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of `x` and `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, the optimal solution would be to have each sub-problem with difficulty `x // n`.
   - Otherwise, we need to find pairs `(i, x // i)` such that `i` divides `x` and `i <= n` or `x // i <= n`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It then iterates through possible values from `1` to `isqrt(x)` to check if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x` and `n <= x // i`, it updates `ans` with the maximum value of `i`.
     - If `x // i` is a divisor of `x` and `n <= i`, it updates `ans` with the maximum value of `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum balance found.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `x` is divisible by `n` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` ensures that the loop runs efficiently.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is sound and covers all necessary conditions to maximize the balance.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results as expected.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. Specifically, the program does not guarantee that the maximum balance is achieved when splitting `x` into `n` sub-problems optimally. The current logic only checks for divisors `i` and `x // i` within the range `[1, isqrt(x)]`, but it does not ensure that the GCD of the sub-problems is maximized.

To illustrate, consider the example `x = 420` and `n = 69`. The correct answer should be `6` because the optimal split is `420 = 6 * 70`, and the GCD of `69` sub-problems each with difficulty `6` is `6`. However, the current program logic might miss this optimal split.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not guarantee the correct maximum balance for all test cases due to the incomplete search space. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
