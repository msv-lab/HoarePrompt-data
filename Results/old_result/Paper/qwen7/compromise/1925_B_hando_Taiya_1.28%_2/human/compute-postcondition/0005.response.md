Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
- `ans` is the maximum value between all `i` and `x // i` where `i` is a divisor of `x` and either `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `n`.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the calculation of `ans`:

1. We need to find all divisors `i` of `x` such that either `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `n`.
2. For each such divisor `i`, we consider both `i` and `x // i` and take the maximum value.
3. `ans` is set to the maximum value found from these comparisons.

Since the exact values of `x`, `n`, and the divisors are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, we can describe the value of `ans` based on the conditions given.

The value of `ans` will be the maximum value between any divisor `i` of `x` and `x // i` where either `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value between all i and x // i for divisors i of x such that either i or x // i is less than or equal to n)**
