You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and two strings of length \( n \) made up of '<' and '/>'. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is '<'. If it is, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It then reads two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid.

2. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) is `<`.
     - If it is `<`, the program prints 'No'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and needs to reach `(2, n)`.
   - The robot can only move according to the direction of the arrows in the cells.
   - The key observation here is that if the robot reaches the second-to-last column in the second row (`(2, n-1)`), it must move down to `(2, n)` if the arrow in that cell is `>`.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program only checks the second-to-last column in the second row (`(2, n-1)`) and assumes that if the arrow is `>`, the robot can reach `(2, n)`. However, this is not sufficient.
   - The robot must follow the sequence of arrows correctly from `(1, 1)` to `(2, n)`. Simply checking one cell is insufficient.

2. **Missing Path Validation:**
   - The program does not validate the entire path from `(1, 1)` to `(2, n)`.
   - It does not check if the robot can navigate through the grid correctly by following the arrows.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly validate the entire path from the starting cell to the target cell. It only checks one specific condition, which is not enough to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

### Correctness: **False**
