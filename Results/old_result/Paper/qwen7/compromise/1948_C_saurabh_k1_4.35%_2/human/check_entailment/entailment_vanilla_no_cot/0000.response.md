Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the second-to-last column's direction in the second row and makes a decision based on that. This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The solution should consider the entire path the robot takes from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n).

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()  # Read the first row directly as a string
        b = input()  # Read the second row directly as a string
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        x, y = 0, 0  # Start at (1, 1)
        while True:
            # Move down to the next row
            x += 1
            # Move according to the arrow in the current cell
            if a[y] == '<':
                y -= 1
            else:
                y += 1
            
            # Check if we have reached the target cell (2, n)
            if x == 1 and y == n-1:
                break
            elif x == 2 and y == n:
                print('YES')
                break
            elif x == 2 and y < n:
                print('NO')
                break

        # If the loop exits without reaching the target, check the final position
        if x == 2 and y == n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the robot's movement through the grid and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n).
