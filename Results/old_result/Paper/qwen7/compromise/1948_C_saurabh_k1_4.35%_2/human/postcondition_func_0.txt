The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and two strings of length \( n \) made up of '<' and '/>'. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is '<'. If it is, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
