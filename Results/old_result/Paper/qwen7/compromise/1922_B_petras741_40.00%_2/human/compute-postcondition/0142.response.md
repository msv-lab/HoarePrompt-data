Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, and `q[w[j]]` will be incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**

In more detail, since the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`, after all iterations, `j` will become `n`. The variable `q` will have its value at index `w[j]` incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`. This means `q[w[j]]` will be incremented exactly `n` times, once for each iteration of the loop.
