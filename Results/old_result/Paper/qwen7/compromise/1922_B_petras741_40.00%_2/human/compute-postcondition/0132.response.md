Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces, `eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 0, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, `w` is updated to a list of integers from the new input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `w` by converting each element of the new input (split by spaces) into integers. All other variables remain unchanged. The variable `n` is reassigned to the value of the new input converted to an integer.
