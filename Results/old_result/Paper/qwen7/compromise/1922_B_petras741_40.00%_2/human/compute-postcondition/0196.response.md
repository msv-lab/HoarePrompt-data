Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list of non-negative integers a (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and the list a.**

This means the function takes a series of test cases as input, where each test case contains a value for `t`, `n`, and a list `a`. It then processes these inputs according to their specified ranges and returns output based on the given conditions.
