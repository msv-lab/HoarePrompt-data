Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `eta` is an empty list.
   - `q` reflects the count of each integer present in the list `w`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 (the default starting point for `range`), the loop will execute at least once if `n + 1` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n + 1` is greater than 0.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `eta` being an empty list does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `q` reflecting the count of integers in `w` also does not affect the loop execution directly.

Based on the above steps, the only state that needs adjustment is `n + 1` must be greater than 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`eta` is an empty list, `q` reflects the count of each integer present in the list `w`, `n + 1` must be greater than 0**
