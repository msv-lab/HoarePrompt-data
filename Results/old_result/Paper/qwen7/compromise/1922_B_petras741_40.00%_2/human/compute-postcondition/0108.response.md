Postcondition: `n` is 1 or 2, `j` is either `n` or greater than 1000, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) * (q[eta[n]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
