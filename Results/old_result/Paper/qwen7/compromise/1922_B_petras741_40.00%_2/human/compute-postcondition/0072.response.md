Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the dictionary `q` as a list of length `n + 1` where each element is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
