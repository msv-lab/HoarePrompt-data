Output State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1. The condition `j` must be less than `n` is still valid, but since no new information about `j` relative to `n` is provided, we only update the values of `q[w[j]]` and `j`.
