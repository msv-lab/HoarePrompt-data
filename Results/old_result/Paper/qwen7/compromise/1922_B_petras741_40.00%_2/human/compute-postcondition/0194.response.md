Postcondition: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is greater than 1000, `rho` is the sum of `q[0]` and the first 1001 elements of `q` (i.e., `sum(q[1:1002])`), and `res` is the cumulative sum of the expressions evaluated for each `j` from 1 to 1001 if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer less than 3, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces, `eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 0, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, and `w` is updated to a list of integers from the new input split by spaces.**
