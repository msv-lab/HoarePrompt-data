Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` but immediately overwrites it with `1` and then reads the actual value of `t`. This is incorrect because the value of `t` should be used as is.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The program should loop through each test case using the correct value of `t`, but instead, it calls `func_1()` without properly handling multiple test cases.

3. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined correctly. It reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths, counts the occurrences of each length, and calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

4. **Calculating Maximum Polygons**:
   - The function correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon must have at least 3 sides).

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is correct.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has issues with handling multiple test cases and overwriting the value of `t`. However, once these issues are fixed, the logic within the function `func_1()` is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
