### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
   - It works by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 until `n` becomes 0, counting the number of divisions (`position`).
   - After the loop, `position - 1` is returned, which gives the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates over each test case.
   - If `n > 1`, it constructs an array `arr` with specific values:
     - The first element is `2 ** counter - 1`, where `counter` is the result of `func_1(k)`.
     - The second element is `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`.
     - The remaining elements are set to 0.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Binary OR Operation Consideration**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the array elements.
   - Using `2 ** counter - 1` ensures that the first element has as many 1s as possible within the constraints.
   - The second element is adjusted to ensure the total sum is `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n == 1`, the solution is straightforward: just print `k`.
   - For `n > 1`, the constructed array should satisfy both conditions:
     - Sum of elements equals `k`.
     - Maximum number of 1s in the binary OR of the elements.

5. **Validation**:
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and produces valid outputs for the given examples.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, ensuring the construction of the array meets the requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of integers that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
