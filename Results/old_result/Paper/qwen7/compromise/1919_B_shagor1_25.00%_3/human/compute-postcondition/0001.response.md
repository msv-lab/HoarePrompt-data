Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'**.

The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The string `s` now holds the input provided by the user, which is expected to be of length `n` and consist only of the characters '+' and '-'.
