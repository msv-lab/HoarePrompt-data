Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), and a string s of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'. For each test case, the function processes the string s and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

However, since the specific output logic is not provided in the problem statement, the functionality can be described as accepting the implied parameters and returning a result for each test case based on the given constraints.
