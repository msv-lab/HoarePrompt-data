Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.
2. The program calculates the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and uses this to compute a penalty, but it does not split the array into optimal subarrays to minimize the penalty.
3. The logic `n - 2 * neg` is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal way to split the array based on the sum of its elements.
4. For example, consider the test case `5` with input `-----`. The program incorrectly outputs `5`, but the correct answer should be `5` as well, but the approach to splitting the array is not optimal.
5. Another example is the test case `6` with input `+-+-+-`. The program incorrectly outputs `0`, but the correct answer should be `6` if we split it into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
