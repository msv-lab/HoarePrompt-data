### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Counting Negatives:**
   - The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.
   - This formula is incorrect for calculating the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The formula `n - 2 * neg` does not account for the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

4. **Optimal Splitting:**
   - To achieve the minimum possible penalty, the array should be split into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is zero or as close to zero as possible.
   - The provided program does not implement any logic to achieve this optimal splitting. Instead, it simply counts the number of '-' characters and uses a linear formula which does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

5. **Examples:**
   - For the test case `5` with input `-----`, the program incorrectly outputs `5`. The correct approach would be to split the array into `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1]` and `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1]`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.
   - For the test case `6` with input `+-+-+-`, the program incorrectly outputs `0`. The correct approach would be to split the array into `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, resulting in a penalty of `6`.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
