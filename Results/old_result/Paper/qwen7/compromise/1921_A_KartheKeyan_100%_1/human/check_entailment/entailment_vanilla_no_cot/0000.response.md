Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has an issue in how it calculates the side length of the square. The logic used to calculate `p1` and `p2` does not correctly identify the side lengths of the square. Instead, it calculates the squared distance between two arbitrary points, which will not necessarily give the side length of the square.

To fix this, we need to correctly identify the pairs of points that form the sides of the square. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort the coordinates to make it easier to identify the sides
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        # Calculate the distances between all pairs of points
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dx = abs(coord[i][0] - coord[j][0])
                dy = abs(coord[i][1] - coord[j][1])
                distances.append(dx)
                distances.append(dy)
        
        # Find the unique distances
        unique_distances = list(set(distances))
        
        # The smallest two unique distances should be the side length of the square
        side_length = min(unique_distances)
        
        # Area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the side length of the square is correctly identified by calculating the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates between all pairs of points and then determining the unique side lengths.
