Reasoning:

The given program aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and calculates the area of the square.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`n`).
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes an empty list `coord` to store the coordinates.
   - It reads four pairs of coordinates and appends them to `coord`.
   - It sorts the coordinates to ensure they are in a consistent order.
   - It calculates the squared distance between the first and second corner and the third and fourth corner.
   - It computes the side length of the square by taking the square root of these distances and then multiplies them to get the area.
   - It prints the rounded area.
3. **Loop Decrement**: The loop counter `n` is decremented after processing each test case until it reaches 0.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the area of the square. The approach of calculating the distances between specific pairs of points and then determining the area is valid for squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
