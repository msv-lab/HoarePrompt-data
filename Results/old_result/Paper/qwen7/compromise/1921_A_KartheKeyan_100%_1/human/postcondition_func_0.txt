The function processes a series of square coordinates provided as input. For each set of coordinates, it calculates the side length of the square and prints the product of the square roots of the distances between the first and second corner and the third and fourth corner. After processing all sets of coordinates, the function ensures that the loop counter `n` is decremented to 0.
