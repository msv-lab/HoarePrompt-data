Output State: **`n` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, since no specific value is provided for `n` in the initial state, we can only say that `n` is decremented by 1 after this line of code is executed. The initial state also mentions that there are four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, and another variable `s` which is updated based on the value of `l`. But since no value for `l` is provided and the code snippet does not involve `s` or the coordinates, these remain unchanged.
