Output State: `n` is 0, `total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples sorted by their first elements, each tuple representing the (x, y) coordinates provided as input, `i` is 3, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `p1` is (input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)², `p2` is ((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²), `res` is sqrt((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²) * sqrt(((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²)).

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be decremented to 0 since it starts at a value greater than 0 and is decreased by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `total` is not mentioned in the loop body or head, so it remains 0. The variable `coord` will contain the coordinates provided as input, sorted by their first elements, after all iterations. The variable `i` will be 3 because the for loop runs 4 times for each iteration of the while loop. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last set of coordinates provided as input, and `p1` and `p2` will be calculated based on these last coordinates. The variable `res` will be the final result printed after the last iteration, which is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
