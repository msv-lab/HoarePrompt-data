Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**.

The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are integers from input, they form a tuple which is added to `coord`. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
