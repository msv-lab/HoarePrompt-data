Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The values of `res`, `n`, `coord`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
