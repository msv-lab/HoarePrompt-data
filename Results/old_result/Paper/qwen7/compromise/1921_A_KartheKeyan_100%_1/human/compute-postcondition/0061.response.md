Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is 2, `coord` is [(`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer), (`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer)], `p1` is (input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)², `res` is sqrt((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²) * sqrt(((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²)), `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `p2` is ((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²)**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by 1, so `n` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
