Output State: `res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('x', 'y'), ('x', 'y'), ('x', 'y'), ('x', 'y')]`, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.

This means after the loop completes all 4 iterations, the variable `res` remains 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `n` must remain non-zero as per the initial condition. The list `coord` will contain 4 tuples, each representing a pair of integers (`x`, `y`) entered as input. The variable `i` will be 3 since the loop runs from `0` to `3`, inclusive. The values of `x` and `y` represent the inputs provided during the last iteration of the loop.
