Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n` as a string and then converts it to an integer using `int(n)`, which is incorrect. `n` should be read directly as an integer without converting it back to a string.

2. **Score Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the score is flawed. The variable `s` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case, but it should accumulate the score across all test cases. Also, the loop that calculates the score should not be inside the loop that processes each test case.

3. **Test Case Loop**: The program uses a single loop to process all test cases, but it incorrectly resets variables and processes each test case separately.

4. **Input Reading**: The program reads the entire list of numbers for each test case before sorting and processing them, which is unnecessary and inefficient.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[index:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        
        nums.sort()
        
        score = sum(nums[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases, sorts the numbers correctly, and accumulates the score across all test cases.
