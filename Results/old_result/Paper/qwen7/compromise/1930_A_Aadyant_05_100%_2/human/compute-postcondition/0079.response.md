The only objects in the loop head are variables `fin` and `final`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `final`. For the loop to execute again, `final` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration, `final` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `final` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`final` must contain at least one element**
