Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `num` is `prev_num + 1`, `a` retains its value, `b` retains its value, `list1` retains its value, and `final` contains the sum 0.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is reassigned to 0, which overwrites its previous value as the sum of `list2` at even indices. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, and `final`) retain their previous values.
