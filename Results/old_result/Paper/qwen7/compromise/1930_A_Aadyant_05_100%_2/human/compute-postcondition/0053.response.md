Output State: **`list2` is a list, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `final` is 0, `num` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `list2 = []` assigns an empty list to `list2`. This means `list2` no longer holds any elements, which affects the values of `i`, `s`, `final`, and `num` as follows:
- `i` is set to the length of `list2`, which is 0.
- `s` remains 0 since it is not affected by the assignment.
- `final` remains 0 because it is calculated from elements at even indices of `list2`, and now `list2` is empty.
- `num` is set to 1, as it is not affected by the assignment.
