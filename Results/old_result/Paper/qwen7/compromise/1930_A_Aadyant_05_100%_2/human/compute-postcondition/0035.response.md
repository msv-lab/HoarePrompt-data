Output State: **`list2` contains an element which is the integer conversion of `str`.**

Explanation: The code `list2.append(int(str))` appends to `list2` the integer conversion of the string `str`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `str`, the output state simply states that `list2` now contains the integer form of `str`.
