Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `final` must contain at least one element.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for fin in final:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `fin` is iterating over the elements of the `final` list. However, the loop itself does not modify `final` or `fin` directly within the loop body (since the body is omitted). Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are those mentioned in the loop head, which are `fin` and `final`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, `final` must contain at least one element. Since `fin` is just an element being iterated over, it doesn't affect the condition for the loop to continue.

3. **State Adjustment**: At the end of the previous iteration, `final` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `final` must still contain at least one element.

### Conclusion
Since the loop continues as long as `final` contains at least one element, and no other variables are involved in the loop head, the state remains the same regarding `final`.

### Final Answer
State: **`final` must contain at least one element**
