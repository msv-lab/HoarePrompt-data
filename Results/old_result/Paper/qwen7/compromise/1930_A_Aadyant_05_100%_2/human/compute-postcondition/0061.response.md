Output State: **`list1` must contain at least two strings, `str` is the second element of `list1`, `list2` contains an integer which is the integer representation of the second element of `list1` + [integer value of the second element of `list1`] appended to `list2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer representation of the second element of `list1` (which is stored in `str`) to `list2`. Since `str` is the second element of `list1` and is converted to an integer, `list2` now contains all its original elements plus this new integer.
