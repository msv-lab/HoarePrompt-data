Output State: **`list1` must contain at least two strings, `str` is the third element of `list1`, `list2` contains an integer which is the integer representation of the third element of `list1` appended to `list2`.**

Explanation: The code `list2.append(int(str))` appends the integer representation of the third element of `list1` (which is stored in the variable `str`) to `list2`. Since `str` is the third element of `list1`, and `list2` originally contained an integer which was the integer representation of the third element of `list1` plus another integer value, after appending the new integer representation of `str` to `list2`, `list2` now contains two integers: the original integer and the integer representation of `str`.
