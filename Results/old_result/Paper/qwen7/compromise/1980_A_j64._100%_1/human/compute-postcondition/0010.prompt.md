You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: count is [number of A's, number of B's, number of C's, number of D's, number of E's, number of F's, number of G's] in the string a.
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is [number of A's, number of B's, number of C's, number of D's, number of E's, number of F's, number of G's], `needed_problems` is 7*m - (number of A's + number of B's + number of C's + number of D's + number of E's + number of F's + number of G's).
    #
    #In this output state, the `count` array remains the same as in the initial state because the loop does not modify the counts of each character. The `needed_problems` variable is updated to 7*m minus the total count of all characters in the string `a`, where `m` is the threshold value used in the loop condition.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns the value of `needed_problems` which is calculated as 7*m minus the total count of all characters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) in the `count` array.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; `m` is an integer between 1 and 5; and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns the value of `needed_problems`, which is calculated as 7 times `m` minus the total count of all characters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) in the string `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `needed_problems` which is calculated as 7*m minus the total count of all characters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) in the `count` array.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
