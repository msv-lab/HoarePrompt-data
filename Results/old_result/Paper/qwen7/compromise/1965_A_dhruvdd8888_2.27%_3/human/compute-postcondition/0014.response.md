Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(nums) - 2`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to start and continue executing.

3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `cd` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (not relevant to the loop).
   - `N` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop).
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and its length is greater than 3.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `i` is set to a value that allows the loop to start and continue.
   - The loop will start when `i` is 0 and will continue as long as `i < len(nums) - 2`.
   - Given that `len(nums)` is greater than 3, `len(nums) - 2` will be at least 1. Therefore, `i` should be set to 0 to allow the loop to start.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `len(nums)` should be confirmed to be greater than 3.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `len(nums)` must be greater than 3**.
