Reasoning:
The provided program consists of two separate functions with different purposes and input requirements. The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is designed to create `.py` files within specified directories containing `.html` files, while the `func_1` function is intended to process input strings according to specific conditions.

Given the annotated program and the states provided, it is clear that the `func_1` function is not being called correctly. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block should call `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start_range, end_range)` instead of `func_1()`.

Furthermore, the `func_1` function itself is not relevant to the original problem statement, which describes a task involving creating files based on directory structures and `.html` files. Therefore, the presence of `func_1` and its logic do not affect the correctness of the file generation logic.

However, since the main function (`generate_files_for_html_in_range`) is not being called with the correct parameters, the program as written does not perform the intended task. Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not execute the core functionality described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
