Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` (1 to 100) and an integer `n` (3 to 78). For each test case, it generates a string `word` based on the value of `n` and prints it. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` consists of the character corresponding to `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52, `word` starts with 'a', followed by the character corresponding to `n - 28`, and ends with 'z'. If `n` is exactly 27, `word` is set to 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character corresponding to `n - 3'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each generated `word`.**
