Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `alphabet` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `int(input())` must be a valid input that can be converted to an integer.
   - Let's denote the integer input as `k`. The value of `k` must be within the range of possible values for `t` (since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100), but more importantly, it must be greater than or equal to `n` (since `n` is an integer between 3 and 78).

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.
   - The loop will start when `i` is less than `k`, where `k` is the integer input from the user.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- The value of `i` should be set to 0.
- The value of `k` (which is `int(input())`) should be an integer within the range of `n` to `t`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` (int(input())) must be an integer such that `n` <= k <= t**
