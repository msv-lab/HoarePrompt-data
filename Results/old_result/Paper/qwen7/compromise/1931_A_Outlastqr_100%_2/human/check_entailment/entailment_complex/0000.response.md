Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded based on the sum of the positions of its characters.
2. The annotated program correctly handles different ranges of the encoded integer `n` to construct the lexicographically smallest word:
   - For `n > 52`: The word is constructed as the character corresponding to `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
   - For `28 < n <= 52`: The word is constructed as 'a' followed by the character corresponding to `n - 28` and ending with 'z'.
   - For `n == 27`: The word is set to 'aay'.
   - For `n <= 26`: The word is constructed as 'aa' followed by the character corresponding to `n - 3`.
3. These conditions cover all possible values of `n` within the specified range (3 to 78), ensuring that the lexicographically smallest word is generated for each test case.
4. The logic in the program accurately reflects the problem's requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
