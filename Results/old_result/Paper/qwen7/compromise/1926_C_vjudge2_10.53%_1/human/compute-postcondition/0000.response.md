Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid after the code is executed, as the input is expected to meet this condition. The other information about `n` (which is only relevant within each of the `t` test cases) is not yet applicable since no test cases have been run.
