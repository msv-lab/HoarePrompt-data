Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for n in numbers:`. The objects involved here are `n` and `numbers`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `numbers` is unchanged, meaning its contents remain as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46]`.
   - `n` will take on each value from `numbers` one by one during the loop iterations.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `numbers` to iterate over. Therefore, `numbers` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `numbers` is unchanged and must contain at least one element, we need to ensure that `numbers` is not empty.
   - The variable `n` will start with the first element of `numbers`, which is `0`.

Given these points, the adjusted state should be:

**State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46], `n` is 0, and `numbers` must contain at least one element.**

However, since `numbers` is explicitly stated to be unchanged and contains multiple elements, we can simplify the adjustment to just ensuring `numbers` is not empty.

**Final State:**
State: **`total` is 45, `numbers` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46], `n` is 0**
