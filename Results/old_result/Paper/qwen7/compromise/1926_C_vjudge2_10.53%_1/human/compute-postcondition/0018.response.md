Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, it reads \( t \) integers from input and stores them in a list named `numbers`. It then initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, and populates them with specific values. Finally, it iterates over the `numbers` list and prints the corresponding values from the `sum_values` list. The function does not return any value but modifies and uses the `sum_values` list to store cumulative sums based on certain rules.**
