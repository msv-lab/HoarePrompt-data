Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from `10` to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at `10` and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `10`, the initial value of `i` should be `10`.

4. **Determine the value of `n`**: For the loop to start executing, `n` must be greater than or equal to `10`. If `n` were less than `10`, the loop would not execute because there would be no values of `i` in the range `[10, n + 1)`.

5. **Check other variables**: The variables `total`, `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop starts. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `10`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `10`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10**
