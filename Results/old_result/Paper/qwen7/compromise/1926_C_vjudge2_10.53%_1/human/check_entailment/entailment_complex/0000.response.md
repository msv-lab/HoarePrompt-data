Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1()` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves reading an integer \( t \) and then \( t \) integers \( n \).
2. The function initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, which are supposed to store intermediate results for digit sum calculations.
3. The initial part of the function correctly sets up the `values` and `sum_values` lists for single-digit numbers.
4. However, the logic for calculating the digit sum for multi-digit numbers is flawed. Specifically, the code attempts to break down the number into its last digit and the remaining part but incorrectly uses the precomputed `values` and `sum_values` to compute the result.
5. The core issue lies in the following lines:
   ```python
   for i in range(10, n + 1):
       word = str(i)
       last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
       remainder = int(word[:-1])
       values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
       sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
       sum_values[i] = sum_total
   ```
   This approach does not correctly compute the digit sum of the number. Instead, it tries to use previously computed values in a way that does not align with the actual digit sum calculation.
6. A correct approach would be to directly compute the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to \( n \) and accumulate these sums.

Given the above reasoning, the provided implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the digit sum for multi-digit numbers.

Correctness: **False**
