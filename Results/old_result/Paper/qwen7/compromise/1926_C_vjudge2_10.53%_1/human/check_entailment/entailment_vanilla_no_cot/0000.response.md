Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the approach of precomputing sums in `sum_values` and handling each digit separately is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Digits**: The code attempts to break down each number into its last digit and the remaining part but fails to handle the summation of digits correctly for numbers greater than 9.
2. **Precomputed Values**: The array `values` and `sum_values` are not used correctly to compute the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `n`.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for computing the sum of digits for numbers greater than 9 is incorrect and does not account for the sum of all digits properly.

A correct solution would involve iterating through each number from 1 to `n`, calculating the sum of its digits, and then summing these values. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
            total_sum += digit_sum
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

This version correctly calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `n` and accumulates the total sum, which matches the problem requirements.
