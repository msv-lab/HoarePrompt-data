Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. Based on the value of `n`, it prints a specific pattern consisting of `#` and `.` characters. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 pattern; if `n` is 2, a 4x4 pattern; if `n` is 3, a 6x6 pattern; and if `n` is 4, an 8x8 pattern. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, it ends with no further output.**
