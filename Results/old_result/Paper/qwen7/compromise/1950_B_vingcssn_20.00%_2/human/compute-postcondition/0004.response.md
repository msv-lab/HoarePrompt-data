Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `t` and `n`.**

Given the constraints and the implied processing, the function likely evaluates `t` and `n` and returns a result based on their values, though the specific return values are not detailed in the provided information.
