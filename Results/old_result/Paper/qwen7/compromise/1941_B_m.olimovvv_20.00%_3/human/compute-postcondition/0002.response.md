Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9; the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; after executing the loop, for each test case, if the first element of the array a is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of the array a is odd and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, the output will be 'NO', otherwise 'YES'.
