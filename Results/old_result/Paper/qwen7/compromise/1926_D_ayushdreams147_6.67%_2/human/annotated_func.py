#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the results of the bitwise operation on each number in `a`, and the values are the counts of these keys, with the count decremented for numbers that appear more than once in the list.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list 'a' after applying the bitwise operation 'num ^ (1 << 31) - 1', and 'count' is a dictionary where the keys are the results of the bitwise operation on each number in 'a', and the values are the counts of these keys, with the count decremented for numbers that appear more than once in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` and a positive integer `n` representing the number of integers in the list. It applies a bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each integer in the list, counts the unique results of this operation, and tracks the occurrences of each result. Finally, it returns the count of unique results and a dictionary containing the results of the bitwise operation as keys and their respective counts as values, with counts decremented for duplicates.
