Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines, each corresponding to one test case. For each test case, if \( b \leq a \), the output is \( a \times n \). Otherwise, the output is \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).

This means for each test case, the output will either be the product of \( a \) and \( n \) if \( b \) is less than or equal to \( a \), or a more complex calculation involving \( a \), \( b \), and \( n \) otherwise.
