Functionality: **The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads three positive integers (`n`, `a`, and `b`) and calculates and prints the result based on the following conditions: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`; otherwise, it calculates and prints a value derived from `a`, `b`, and `n` using the formula \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
