Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers by repeatedly modifying the values based on certain conditions until no further modifications can be made. Specifically, it checks each element (except the first and last) to see if it and its adjacent elements meet specific criteria. If so, it reduces the middle element and its neighbors accordingly. After processing, the function calls another function `func_1(list, n)` to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state of the list is such that all elements are either 0 or negative, with the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all being exactly 0. The function does not return any value.**
