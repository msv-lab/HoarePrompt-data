Output State: **All elements in the list must be changed such that `list[i] > -1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 1`.**

Explanation: The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` subtracts twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`. Given the precondition that `list[i - 1] > 0`, the new value of `list[i]` will be greater than `-1` (since subtracting a positive number from a number greater than 1 will result in a number greater than -1). The other conditions (`list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 1`) remain unchanged.
