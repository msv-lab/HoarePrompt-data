You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is the length of the array such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The function has iterated through all elements of the list `list`. The variable `i` is now equal to `n`, which is the length of the list. Since the loop did not return `False` during any iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, it means that every element in the list `list` was found to be 0. Therefore, the function did not return `False` and completed all its iterations without encountering any non-zero element.
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is the length of the array such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5. Each element in the array is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

    #State: Output State: All elements in the list are 0 or negative, with `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` all being 0. The loop terminates because none of the conditions inside the while loop are satisfied, as all relevant elements in the list have been reduced to 0 or below.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, every element in the list will be 0 or a negative number, but specifically, the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` will all be exactly 0.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: All elements in the list are 0 or negative, with `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` all being 0. The loop terminates because none of the conditions inside the while loop are satisfied, as all relevant elements in the list have been reduced to 0 or below. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` returns the same boolean value in both cases (True if the if part is executed, and False if the else part is executed).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` equal to zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 \le i \le n-1`) and performing the following assignments:
     - `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`

2. **Analyzing the Given Functions:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
     - It returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise `True`.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operation.
     - It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
     - For each index `i`, it checks if the conditions allow the operation to be applied (`list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`).
     - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation and updates the array.
     - If at any point an index `i-1` is found to be non-zero after the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly implement the operation and check if the array can be made zero.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the way the operation is applied. Specifically, the operation should be applied in such a way that the total reduction matches the initial values.
   - The current implementation assumes that the operation can always be applied as long as the conditions are met, but it does not ensure that the total reduction matches the initial values correctly.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify the example provided:
     - For the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`:
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=3` results in `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=2` results in `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
       - The function correctly identifies that it is possible to make all elements zero.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite the potential issues with the logic, the provided functions seem to handle the example correctly. However, without further rigorous testing and analysis, it is difficult to definitively say if the function is always correct for all cases.

### Final Answer:
Given the provided example and the logic implemented, the function appears to work correctly for the given example. However, due to the complexity and the potential edge cases, it is recommended to perform additional testing to ensure correctness.

**Correctness: **False** (Pending further verification)**
