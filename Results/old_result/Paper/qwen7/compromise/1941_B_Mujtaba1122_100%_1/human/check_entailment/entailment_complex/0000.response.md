Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero. It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element. If it completes the iteration without finding any non-zero elements, it returns `True`. This function is used to verify if the list is fully zeroed out after processing.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list according to the specified operation rules. It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (excluding the first and last elements), and for each element, it checks if it and its adjacent elements can be modified according to the given operation. If the condition `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` is met, it performs the operation to modify the list. The loop continues until no more modifications can be made. After processing, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_2` to process the array.
   - Based on the result of `func_2`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotations, the logic in `func_2` is designed to ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operations. The function correctly implements the logic to perform the operations and check the final state of the array. The main program correctly handles the input and output as per the problem requirements.

Therefore, the given program meets the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
