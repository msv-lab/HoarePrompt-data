Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Adjustment Logic**:
   - The code adds the number of universals (`c`) to the number of extroverts (`b`). This adjustment is necessary because each extrovert needs a tent with two others, and universals can fill any gap.
   - The expression `b // 3` calculates how many full tents (each with 3 people) can be formed using the combined count of extroverts and universals.
   - The expression `b % 3` gives the remainder when the combined count of extroverts and universals is divided by 3. This remainder represents the number of extra people who cannot form a complete tent with 3 people.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` checks if the number of universals is less than the remainder. If true, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents, making it impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences. Hence, the function should return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the function calculates the number of tents required for the introverts and the adjusted extroverts/universals combination. The expression `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a - b // 3` because the unary negation `-` before `b // 3` has no effect. This calculation ensures that each introvert gets a separate tent, and the remaining people (extroverts and universals) are accommodated in full tents of 3.

3. **Output**: The function prints the calculated number of tents for each test case. If it is impossible to accommodate everyone, it prints `-1`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem statement. It handles the conditions for both possible scenarios (enough universals to fill the gaps or not) and correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required.

Therefore, the provided code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
