You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
        
        b += c
        
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a', b', and c' where a' is the result of (a - -b // 3) if c' >= b % 3, otherwise it's just a - -b // 3, b' is the result of b + c, and c' is the original value of c from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing the counts of introverts (a), extroverts (b), and universals (c). For each test case, it calculates the adjusted count of introverts based on the number of extroverts and universals, and prints the result. Specifically, it computes the adjusted introverts count as \(a - \left\lfloor\frac{b + c}{3}\right\rfloor\) if the remainder when \(b + c\) is divided by 3 is less than or equal to the number of universals, otherwise it uses \(a - \left\lfloor\frac{b}{3}\right\rfloor\). The function outputs this adjusted count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the accommodation of participants according to their preferences. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of tents is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Tents for Extroverts and Universals**: The program combines `b` (extroverts) and `c` (universals) and tries to fit them into tents with `b + c` people. However, this approach does not ensure that the remaining universals can be placed in tents according to their preferences.

2. **Handling of Remaining Universals**: After allocating tents for introverts and the combined group of extroverts and universals, the program checks if there are enough universals left to fill the remaining tents. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that each universal can share a tent with one or two others.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `1 2 3`
  - According to the problem description:
    - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
    - 2 extroverts and 3 universals can share 1 tent (2 extroverts + 1 universal).
    - The remaining 2 universals can share another tent.
  - Expected output: `3` tents.
  - Actual output from the program: `3` tents (which seems correct in this specific case).

However, let's consider another example:
- Input: `1 4 1`
  - According to the problem description:
    - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
    - 4 extroverts cannot be fully accommodated because they require 2 more people to fill the last tent.
    - 1 universal cannot be paired with an extrovert to form a full tent.
  - Expected output: `-1` (since it's impossible to accommodate all participants).
  - Actual output from the program: `3` tents (which is incorrect).

Therefore, the program fails to correctly handle cases where it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, leading to an incorrect output.
