State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at all, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. Since `t` is given as an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), we need to ensure that `t` is within this range.
4. Therefore, the state of `t` must be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500.
