Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `flag`) remain unchanged. Since `s[i]` was originally equal to `s[i + 1]` (both were '1'), after the change, `s[i]` is now '-1' and still needs to be equal to `s[i + 1]`, which remains '1'. However, since `s[i]` is updated, the equality condition is no longer true. But the problem only asks to list the updated values and the unchanged ones.
