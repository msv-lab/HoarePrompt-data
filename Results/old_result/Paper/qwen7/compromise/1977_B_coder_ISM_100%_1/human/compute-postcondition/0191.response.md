Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `length` is 30

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `length-1`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `length` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new value of `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `length` remains 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30**
