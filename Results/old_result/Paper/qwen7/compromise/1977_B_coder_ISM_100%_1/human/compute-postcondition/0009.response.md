Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an integer, and the result of `(x & pow(2, i))` is False; `s` is a list containing '0'.**

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `i` is 0 and the result of `(x & pow(2, i))` is False, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list `s`.
