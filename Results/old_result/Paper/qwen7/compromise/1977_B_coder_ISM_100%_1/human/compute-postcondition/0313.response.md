Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `x` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 2^30 - 1. It returns a result based on the values of `t` and `x`.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing two integers: `t` and `x`. The function does not take any parameters directly but seems to process these values internally and return a result accordingly.
