Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, length)`.
   - The variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `length - 1`.
   - The variable `length` remains constant throughout the loop.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 29.
   - `length` is greater than 29.
   - If `s[28]` is '-1' and `s[27]` is '1', then no changes are made.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1, if `i` is 29, the next value of `i` would be 30.
   - The condition `if s[28] is '-1' and s[27] is '1'` does not affect the increment of `i`. Therefore, this condition does not change the value of `i` or `length`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 30.
   - `length` remains the same and is still greater than 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 30, `length` is greater than 30**.
