Output State: **`i` is 30; `s` is a list containing '0'**

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `i` was initially set to 30 and no operation was performed on `i`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated list `s` and the unchanged variable `i`.
