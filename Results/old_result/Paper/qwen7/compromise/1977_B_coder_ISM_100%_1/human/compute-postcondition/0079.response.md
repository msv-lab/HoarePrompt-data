Output State: **`i` is 28, `x` is an integer, `flag` is 1, `s[0]` to `s[28]` are all '1', and `s[29]` is '1'; length is 1 more than its previous value.**

The code `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. Since `length` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After executing the code, `length` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
