Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 1, `nalla` is 30, `t` is greater than or equal to 30, `s` is a list of length 32, the last element of `s` is '1'**.

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the end of the list `s`. Initially, `s` has a length of 31. After appending `'1'`, the length of `s` becomes 32. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
