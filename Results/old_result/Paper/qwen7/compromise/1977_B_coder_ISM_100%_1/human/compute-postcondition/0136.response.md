Output State: **`i` is between 0 and 28 inclusive, `flag` is 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is '-1', and the character at index `i + 1` in string `s` is '1'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the character at index `i` in the string `s` from '1' to '-1'. All other variables (`i`, `flag`) remain unchanged. The character at index `i + 1` in the string `s` remains '1' as specified in the initial state.
