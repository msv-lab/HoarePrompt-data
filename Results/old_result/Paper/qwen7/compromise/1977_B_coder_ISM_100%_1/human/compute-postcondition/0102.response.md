Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 29
- `x` is an integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement)
- `flag` is 1
- `s[0]` to `s[28]` are all '1'
- `s[29]` is '1'

The `print(*s)` statement will unpack the list `s` and print its elements separated by spaces.

Given that `s` contains 30 elements, all of which are '1' except for `s[29]` which is also '1', the output will be a sequence of 30 '1's.

Output: **1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1**
