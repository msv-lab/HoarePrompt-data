Postcondition: **`i` is 28, `x` is an integer, `flag` is 1, `s[0]` to `s[28]` are all '1', and `s[29]` is '1'.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` has reached 28, indicating that the loop has completed all 29 iterations. The value of `x` remains an integer, and `flag` is now set to 1. The array `s` from index 0 to 28 consists entirely of the character '1', and `s[29]` remains '1'.
