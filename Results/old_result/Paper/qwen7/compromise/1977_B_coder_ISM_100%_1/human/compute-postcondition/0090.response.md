Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `length`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `length - 1` (inclusive) because of the range function `range(1, length)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 28.
   - `length` is greater than 28.
   - The postcondition states that if `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `29`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `length`. Given that `length` is greater than 28, `i` being 29 is still within the valid range for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `29`.
   - `length` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 29, `length` is greater than 29**.
