Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements, and `nalla` is 30, `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is between 0 and 28 (inclusive), `flag` is either true or false, `s[i]` is either '0' or not equal to '1', and `s[i + 1]` is not necessarily equal to `s[i]`. If `flag` is true, then `s[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, no change is made to `flag` and `s[i]` remains as either '0' or not equal to '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `flag` remains unchanged (either true or false), and `s[i]` is either '1' if `flag` was true and `s[i]` was '0', otherwise `s[i]` remains as either '0' or not equal to '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `flag` remains unchanged, and `s[i]` is '1' if `flag` was true and `s[i]` was '0', otherwise `s[i]` remains as either '0' or not equal to '1'. This means that if `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is updated to '-1', and if the condition `flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1')` is true, then `s[i]` becomes '-1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` maintains its original value according to the initial precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
