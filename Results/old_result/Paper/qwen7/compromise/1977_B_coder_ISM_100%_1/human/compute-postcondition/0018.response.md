Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing '1' and '0'.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the condition involving `x` and \(2^1\). After appending `'1'`, `s` will contain both `'1'` and `'0'`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
