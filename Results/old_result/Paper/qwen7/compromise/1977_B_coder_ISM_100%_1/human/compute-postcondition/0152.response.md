Postcondition: `i` is between 1 and 28 inclusive, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a string where the character at index `i` is '1' and the character at index `i+1` is not equal to the character at index `i` if `flag` is 0. If `flag` is 1 and the character at index `i` is '0', the character at index `i` is changed to '1'.
