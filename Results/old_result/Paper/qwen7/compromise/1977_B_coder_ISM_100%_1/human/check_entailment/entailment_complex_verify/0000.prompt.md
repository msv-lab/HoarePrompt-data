You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be `30 * t - 1`, meaning it will count up to one less than 30 times the number of iterations. The variable `flag` will be either `True` or `False` depending on the final state of the loop. The `length` variable will be `30 + (t - 1)`, as it increments by 1 for every iteration after the first. The list `s` will contain a sequence of '0's, '1's, and '-1's, with the exact pattern depending on the values of `x` for each iteration and the operations performed within the loop. Each element in `s` will be either '0', '1', or '-1', and the list will have a length of `30 + (t - 1)`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations, `i` will be `29t`, `flag` will be a boolean value, `length` will be `29 + t`, and `s` will be a list of length `29 + t` containing '0's, '1's, and '-1's, reflecting the transformations applied during each iteration based on the input values of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it takes an integer `x` between 1 and 2^30 - 1. It converts `x` into a binary representation of 30 bits and then modifies this binary representation according to specific rules. The function outputs the length of the modified binary sequence and the sequence itself. The final state of the program includes printing the length and the modified binary sequence for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate an array that satisfies the condition that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). 

Consider the input \(x = 2\). According to the problem description, a valid array would be \([1, -1]\) because \(1 \cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 = 1 - 2 = -1\), but this does not match the form \(x = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \cdot 2^i\) for \(x = 2\).

However, the program generates the array \([1, 0, 0, ..., 0]\) for \(x = 2\), which is \([1]\). This array does not satisfy the condition that there should not be consecutive non-zero elements. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement for certain inputs.
