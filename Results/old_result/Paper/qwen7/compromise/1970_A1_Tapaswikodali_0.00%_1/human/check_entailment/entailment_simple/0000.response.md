### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input string `s` which is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. **Balance Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the balance of the prefix up to each character and stores this information along with the character's position in the `details` list.
3. **Sorting**: The `details` list is sorted according to the specified criteria: first by the balance (in ascending order), and then by the negative index (in descending order). This ensures that characters with lower balances come first, and among those with the same balance, later characters (higher indices) come first.
4. **Result Construction**: The sorted characters are joined to form the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.
5. **Output**: The function prints the resulting sequence, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
