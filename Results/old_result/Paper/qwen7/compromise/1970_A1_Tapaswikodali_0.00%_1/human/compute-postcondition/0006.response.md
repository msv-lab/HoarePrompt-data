Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `balance` is the final balance calculated after processing the entire string `s`; `details` is a list of tuples sorted by the first element (balance at each character position)**.

The code `details.sort()` sorts the `details` list based on the balance at each character position. However, since the initial values of `s`, `balance`, and `details` are not specified, we cannot provide specific values for them after sorting. The only change is that the `details` list is now sorted by the balance at each character position.
