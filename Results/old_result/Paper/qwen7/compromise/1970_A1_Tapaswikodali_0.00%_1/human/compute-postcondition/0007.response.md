Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `balance` is the final balance calculated after processing the entire string `s`; `details` is a list of tuples sorted by the first element (balance at each character position); `result` is a string obtained by joining the third element of each tuple in `details`.**

Explanation: The code `result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)` iterates over the `details` list and joins the third element (character) of each tuple into a single string. The other variables (`s`, `balance`, and `details`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
