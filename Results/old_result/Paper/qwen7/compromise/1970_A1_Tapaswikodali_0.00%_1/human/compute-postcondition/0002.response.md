Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `balance` is 0; `details` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `details`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `balance`. Therefore, `s` remains a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `balance` remains 0. The new variable `details` is an empty list.
