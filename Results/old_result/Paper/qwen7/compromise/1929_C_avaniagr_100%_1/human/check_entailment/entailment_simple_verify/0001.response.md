### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Input Reading
- The program reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is a way to read lines from stdin. This is fine as long as the input format matches the expected format.

#### Variable Extraction
- It extracts `k`, `x`, and `a` from each line using `map(int, s.split())`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

#### Condition Checking
1. **Case 1**: `x < k - 1`
   - If Sasha can lose fewer times than the number of times his bet would increase in a win, and he has enough coins to cover one loss plus one win, he can achieve any number of coins.
   - This logic is correct because Sasha can use a simple strategy to ensure he can recover from a loss and continue winning.
2. **Case 2**: `x == k - 1`
   - If Sasha can lose exactly one less time than the number of times his bet would increase in a win, and he has enough coins to cover two losses, he can achieve any number of coins.
   - This logic is also correct for the same reason as above.
3. **Case 3**: `x > k - 1`
   - For larger values of `x`, the program calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue winning.
   - The formula used in the loop is `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, which is a way to calculate the required number of coins to cover a sequence of losses and wins.
   - This logic is correct as well because it ensures Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue increasing his coins.

#### Output
- The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked. This is correct as per the problem statement.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for the third case (`x > k - 1`). The annotated code states that `z` is updated according to the provided rules during each iteration, but the actual implementation does not correctly reflect this. Specifically, the loop should be designed to simulate the sequence of losses and wins to ensure Sasha can recover and continue winning.

Here is the corrected analysis:

1. **Case 1**: `x < k - 1`
   - Correct.
2. **Case 2**: `x == k - 1`
   - Correct.
3. **Case 3**: `x > k - 1`
   - The logic in the loop `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` does not correctly simulate the sequence of losses and wins. Instead, it should simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins enough times to recover.

To fix this, we need to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins enough times to recover. Here is the corrected logic:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            # Simulate the worst-case scenario of losing x times in a row
            z = a
            for _ in range(x):
                z -= 1  # Sasha loses
            z += 1  # Sasha wins once to recover
            for _ in range(x - 1):
                z *= k  # Sasha wins k times to increase his coins
            if z >= a:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

With this corrected logic, the program should accurately determine if Sasha can achieve his goal.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the flawed logic in the third case. The program needs to correctly simulate the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then winning enough times to recover.

Final: **False**
