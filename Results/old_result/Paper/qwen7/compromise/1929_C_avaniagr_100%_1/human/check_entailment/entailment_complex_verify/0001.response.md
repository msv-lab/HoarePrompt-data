### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is a way to read lines from stdin. This is correct as long as the input format matches the expected format.

2. **Variable Extraction**:
   - It extracts `k`, `x`, and `a` from each line using `map(int, s.split())`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal:
     - **Case 1**: `x < k - 1`
       - If Sasha can lose fewer times than the number of times his bet would increase in a win, and he has enough coins to cover one loss plus one win, he can achieve any number of coins.
       - This logic is correct because Sasha can use a simple strategy to ensure he can recover from a loss and continue winning.
     - **Case 2**: `x == k - 1`
       - If Sasha can lose exactly one less time than the number of times his bet would increase in a win, and he has enough coins to cover two losses, he can achieve any number of coins.
       - This logic is also correct for the same reason as above.
     - **Case 3**: `x > k - 1`
       - For larger values of `x`, the program calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue winning.
       - The formula used in the loop is `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, which is a way to calculate the required number of coins to cover a sequence of losses and wins.
       - This logic is correct as well because it ensures Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue increasing his coins.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Issues Identified

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment seems to have overlooked the fact that the program does not correctly handle the logic for the third case (`x > k - 1`). Specifically, the calculation of `z` and the subsequent check `if a >= z:` do not accurately reflect the necessary conditions for Sasha to achieve his goal.

### Corrected Analysis

1. **Case 1**: `x < k - 1`
   - Correctly handles the scenario where Sasha can recover from a loss and continue winning.

2. **Case 2**: `x == k - 1`
   - Correctly handles the scenario where Sasha can recover from a single loss and continue winning.

3. **Case 3**: `x > k - 1`
   - The logic for calculating `z` is flawed. The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` does not correctly represent the minimum number of coins needed to recover from a series of losses and continue winning. The correct approach should involve a more complex calculation that accounts for the exponential growth of the bet size.

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is correct. The program fails to accurately calculate the minimum number of coins needed in the case where `x > k - 1`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the case where `x > k - 1`.
