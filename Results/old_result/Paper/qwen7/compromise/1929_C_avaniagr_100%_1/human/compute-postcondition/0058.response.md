Output State: **`k` is `s` split and converted to int and decreased by 2, `x` is the second value of `s` split and converted to int and must be greater than `k - 3`, `a` is the third value of `s` split and converted to int, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` and then increased by itself divided by `k - 1` plus 1, `i` is 1, `x - k + 3` must be greater than 1; `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` and then increased by itself divided by `k - 1` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` increases the value of `z` by `z // (k - 1) + 1`. The value of `k` is `s` split and converted to int and decreased by 2, and `x` is the second value of `s` split and converted to int and must be greater than `k - 3`. The value of `a` is the third value of `s` split and converted to int. The value of `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` and then increased by itself divided by `k - 1` plus 1. The value of `i` is 1, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
