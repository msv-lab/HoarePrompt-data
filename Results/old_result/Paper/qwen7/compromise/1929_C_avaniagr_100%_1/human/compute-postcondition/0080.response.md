Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `x` must be greater than `k - 5`
- `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in range(x - k + 3):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x - k + 3`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the Value of `i` at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if the loop is to execute again, `i` must be `i + 1`.

2. **Determine the Value of `x` for the Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `x` does not change within the loop itself; it is determined by the initial condition and the loop condition.
   - Since `x` must be greater than `k - 5` and there is no modification to `x` within the loop, `x` remains the same.

3. **Determine the Value of `z` for the Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `z` is modified by the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - This modification happens outside the loop, so the value of `z` remains the same unless explicitly changed within the loop.

### Updated State
- `x` must still be greater than `k - 5` because it hasn't changed.
- `z` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State
State: **`x` must be greater than `k - 5`; `z` is the same as before**.

However, since we need to provide a specific state, we can rephrase it as:

State: **`x` must be greater than `k - 5`; `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`**.

This indicates that `z` will be updated according to the given formula in the next iteration, but its current value is unchanged.
