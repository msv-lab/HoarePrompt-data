Postcondition: `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`, `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`, `s` is the second line of the input (a string), and depending on the value of `x` relative to `k - 1`:
- If `x < k - 1` and `a < x + 1`, then `a` is set to `x`.
- If `x = k - 1` and `a < x + 2`, then `a` is set to `x + 1`.
- If `x = k - 1` and `a >= x + 2`, then `a` remains unchanged.
- If `k - 3 <= x < k - 1`, then `a` is set to `k - 2 + (z // (k - 1) + 1) * (x - k + 3)`.
