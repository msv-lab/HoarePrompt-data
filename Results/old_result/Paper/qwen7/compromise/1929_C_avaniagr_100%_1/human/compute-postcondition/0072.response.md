Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is `k - 2`
- `x` is `x + 1`
- `a` remains unchanged
- `z` is updated based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` times

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since no specific values for `k` and `x` are provided, we can still determine that the print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
