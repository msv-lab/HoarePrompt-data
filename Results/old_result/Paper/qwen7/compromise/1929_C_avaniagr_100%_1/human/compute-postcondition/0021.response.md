Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`.
- `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`.
- `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`.
- `s` is the second line of the input (a string).
- `a` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'` without any changes or additional computations.

Output: **'NO'**
