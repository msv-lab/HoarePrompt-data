Output State: `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`, `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, and `x` must be greater than `k - 3`, `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`, `s` is the second line of the input (a string), `z` is updated by the formula `z = k - 2 + (z // (k - 1) + 1) * (x - k + 3)`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `k` remains the same as the first number in the string `s`, `x` remains the second number in the string `s` and must be greater than `k - 3`, `a` remains the third number in the string `s`, `s` remains the second line of the input, and `z` is the initial value `k - 2` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x - k + 3` times.
