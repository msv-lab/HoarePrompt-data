Output State: **`k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`, `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`, `s` is the second line of the input (a string)**.

This means that the string `s` is split into three integers using space as the delimiter, and these integers are assigned to `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
