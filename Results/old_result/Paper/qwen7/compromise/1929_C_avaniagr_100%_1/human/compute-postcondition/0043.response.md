Postcondition: `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`, `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, and `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`. `s` is the second line of the input (a string). 

- If `x < k - 1` and `a < x + 1`, then `a` is less than or equal to `x`.
- If `x < k - 1` and `a >= x + 1`, then `a` remains unchanged.
- If `x == k - 1` and `a >= x + 2`, then `a` remains unchanged.
- If `x == k - 1` and `a < x + 2`, then `a` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
- If `k - 3 <= x < k - 1`, then `a` is equal to the initial value `k - 2` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x - k + 3` times.
