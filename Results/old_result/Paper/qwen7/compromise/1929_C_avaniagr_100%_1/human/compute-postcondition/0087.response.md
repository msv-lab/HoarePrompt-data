Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` must be greater than `k - 5`
- `z` is increased by `3 * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement is printing a string literal 'YES', and no other variables or objects are being referenced in this statement, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
