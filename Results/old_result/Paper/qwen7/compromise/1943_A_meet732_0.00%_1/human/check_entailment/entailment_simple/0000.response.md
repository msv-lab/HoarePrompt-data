Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
3. It initializes a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each number from `0` to `n`.
4. It populates the `cntl` list with the counts of each number in `a`.
5. The logic to determine the MEX (Minimum Excludant) is as follows:
   - If `cntl[0]` is `0`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is missing.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the initial value of `c` as the minimum of `2` and `cntl[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the numbers from `1` to `n` and decreases `c` for each number that appears less than `2` times in `a`.
   - If `c` becomes `0` or it reaches the end of the iteration, it prints the current value of `j` which represents the MEX.

6. The logic seems to handle the optimal strategy for both players:
   - Alice can always pick `0` to ensure that `0` is included in `c`.
   - Bob will try to avoid creating a sequence where `0` is the MEX by picking other numbers when possible.

7. The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the optimal MEX value for the given game scenario.

Correctness: **True**
