You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. It is also given that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cntl[i]` for all `i` will represent the frequency of the integer `i` in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, it will be adjusted by subtracting `2 * n` and setting `c` to the minimum of 2 and the updated value of `cntl[0] - (2 * n)`. The loop will continue until `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n + 1`. In the final state, `j` will be `n + 1`, and the loop will terminate.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`. This is done correctly using `cntl[i] += 1` for each element `i` in `a`.

3. **Initial MEX Calculation:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, the program prints `0`, which is correct since the MEX of an array containing only positive numbers is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is also correct because Alice can always pick `0` at least twice if there are enough `0`s.

4. **Adjusting MEX Value:**
   - The program then iterates through the counts from `1` to `n` and decrements `c` for each element that appears less than 2 times.
   - If `c` becomes `0` or the loop reaches the end of the `cntl` list, it prints the current index `j`.

### Verification Against Test Cases

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4` followed by `0 0 1 1`
   - `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0, 0]`
   - `c` is set to `2` initially.
   - Since `cntl[1]` is `2`, no decrement happens.
   - Since `c` remains `2`, the program prints `2`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `4` followed by `0 1 2 3`
   - `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `c` is set to `1` initially.
   - Since `cntl[1]` is `1`, `c` is decremented to `0`.
   - The program prints `1`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2` followed by `1 1`
   - `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`
   - `c` is set to `0` initially.
   - The program prints `0`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the optimal MEX value based on the given rules and constraints. It handles all provided test cases accurately.
