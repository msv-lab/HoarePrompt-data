Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is now a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` remains the same, `cntl` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `cntl`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
