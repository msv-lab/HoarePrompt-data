Output State: **`cntl[i]` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` is now a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0 except for `cntl[i]` which is 1, `i` is the first element of the list `a`**.

This means that the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
