Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is now a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `cntl` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `cntl` as a list of length `n + 1` where each element is set to 0. The values of `n`, `t`, `a`, and `cntl` are updated as follows:
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `t` remains a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `a` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces.
- `cntl` is updated to be a list of `n + 1` elements, each initialized to 0.
