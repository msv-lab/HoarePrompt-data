Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `j in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will run from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cntl[0]` is the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`.
   - `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Either `cntl[j]` is less than 2 or `c` is not True or `j` equals `n`. In either case, the loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j = 2`.

5. **Check the Loop Exit Condition**: For the loop to continue, the condition `j < n + 1` must hold true. Given that `j` is incremented to 2, the loop will continue as long as `2 <= n`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged (it must still be greater than or equal to 1).

7. **Final State**:
   - `cntl[0]` remains the same.
   - `c` remains the same.
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cntl[0]` is the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
