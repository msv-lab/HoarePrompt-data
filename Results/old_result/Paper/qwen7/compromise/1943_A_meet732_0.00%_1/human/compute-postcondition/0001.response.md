Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. It is still a positive integer within the specified range.
