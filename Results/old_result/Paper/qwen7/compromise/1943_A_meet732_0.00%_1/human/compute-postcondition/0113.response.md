Based on the initial state provided:

- `cntl[0]` is the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`.
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
- Either `c` is not True or `j` equals `n`.

Let's break down the values:

1. `j` is explicitly stated to be 1.
2. Since `j` is 1, `cntl[j]` is `cntl[1]`. We know `cntl[1]` is less than 2.
3. `cntl[0]` is the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`. This value is not specified, but it does not affect the value of `j` directly.
4. `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`. Since `cntl[0]` is the frequency of 0, and without knowing the exact value, let's consider the possible scenarios:
   - If `cntl[0]` is 1, then `c = min(2, 1 - 1) = min(2, 0) = 0`.
   - If `cntl[0]` is 2, then `c = min(2, 2 - 1) = min(2, 1) = 1`.
   - If `cntl[0]` is greater than 2, then `c = min(2, cntl[0] - 1) = 1`.

However, the exact value of `c` does not affect the value of `j` which is already determined to be 1.

Given these points, the print statement `print(j)` will simply print the value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
