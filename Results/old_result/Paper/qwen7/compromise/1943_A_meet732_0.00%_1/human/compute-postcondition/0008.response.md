Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The variable `i` takes the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and it must have at least one element.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is initially 1.
   - `i` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in the list `a`, after the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the current element in `a`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be a valid element in the list `a`. This means `i` should be one of the elements in `a`.
   - After incrementing `cntl[i]`, the next element in `a` will be processed in the next iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `cntl[i]` will be incremented by 1.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.
- `cntl[i]` will be incremented by 1.

Since `a` must have at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `a`, the updated state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 1, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**

However, since we need to specify the exact state for the next iteration, we can say:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 1, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**

To be more specific about the next `i` and `cntl[i]`:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 1, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**

This can be simplified to:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 1, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**
