Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `cntl[0]` represents the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `cntl[0]` is decremented by `2 * n` and `c` is set to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - (2 * n)`. The loop continues until `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n + 1`. In either case, `j` will be `n + 1`, and `cntl[i]` for all `i` will still represent the frequency of the integer `i` in the list `a`.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block executes, `cntl[0]` reflects the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`, and the loop ensures that `j` becomes `n + 1` while adjusting `c` accordingly. All other elements in `cntl` continue to represent the frequencies of their respective integers in the list `a`.
