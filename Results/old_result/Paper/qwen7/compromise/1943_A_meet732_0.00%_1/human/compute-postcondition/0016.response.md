Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range `1, n + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `j` starts at 1, the loop will execute as long as `1 <= j <= n + 1`.

4. **Identify the variables that need adjustment**: The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `j`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect whether the loop can execute based on the given loop head.

5. **Adjust the state of `j`**: For the loop to start executing, `j` must be set to 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` being set to 1.

**State: **`j` is 1**
