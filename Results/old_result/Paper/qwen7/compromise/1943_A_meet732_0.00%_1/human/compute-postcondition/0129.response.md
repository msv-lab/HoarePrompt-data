Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cntl[0]` is the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`.
   - `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - 3`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - We decrement `c` by 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - Since `cntl[0]` is the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`, it represents how many times 0 appears in the list `a`.
   - `c` is determined by taking the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - 3`. This means if `cntl[0] - 3` is less than 2, then `c` will be `cntl[0] - 3`; otherwise, `c` will be 2.
   - `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `c` is then decremented by 1.

3. **Determining the Value of `c`:**
   - Let's denote the frequency of 0 in the list `a` as `f`.
   - Therefore, `cntl[0] = f`.
   - The value of `c` will be `min(2, f - 3)`.
   - After decrementing `c` by 1, the new value of `c` will be `min(2, f - 3) - 1`.

4. **Final Values:**
   - Regardless of the value of `f`, `c` will always be 1 because `min(2, f - 3)` will be 0 if `f < 3`, and 2 if `f >= 3`. In either case, after decrementing by 1, `c` will be 1.
   - `j` remains 3.

5. **Executing the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(j)` will print the value of `j`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
