### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`.
   - This ensures that we know how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Polygon Formation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of polygons by summing up the integer division of each frequency by 3.
   - This logic assumes that each polygon requires 3 sticks of the same length (the simplest polygon being a triangle).

However, there is a critical issue with the current implementation:

- The problem explicitly states that no stick should be used in more than one polygon. This means that once a polygon is formed, the corresponding sticks should not be counted again for forming another polygon.
- The current implementation does not account for this constraint. It simply divides the frequency of each stick length by 3 without considering the actual formation of polygons.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sticks used in forming one polygon are not reused. One way to achieve this is to keep track of the sticks used in forming polygons and subtract them from the total count before calculating the next polygon.

Here is a revised approach:
1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total number of polygons formed.
2. For each unique stick length, check if the frequency is at least 3.
3. If so, decrement the frequency by 3 and increment the polygon count.
4. Continue until no more polygons can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    polygons = 0
    while True:
        three_sided_polygons = 0
        for length in freq:
            if freq[length] >= 3:
                freq[length] -= 3
                three_sided_polygons += 1
            else:
                break
        if three_sided_polygons == 0:
            break
        polygons += three_sided_polygons
    
    return polygons
```

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the current implementation does not account for the constraint of not reusing sticks.
- The revised approach ensures that sticks are not reused by decrementing the frequency by 3 for each polygon formed and checking if there are enough sticks left to form another polygon.

Given this analysis, the original assessment was accurate.

### Final:
**False**
