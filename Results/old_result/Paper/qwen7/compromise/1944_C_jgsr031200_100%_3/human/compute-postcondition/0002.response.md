Output State: `arr` remains a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element represents the frequency of the corresponding index in `arr`. Specifically, for each index \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\), `freq[i]` contains the number of times \(i\) appears in `arr`.
