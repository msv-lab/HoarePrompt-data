### Reasoning:

The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the first integer that appears exactly once or does not appear at all in the list `arr`, and print it. However, this approach does not align with the game rules and the objective of maximizing the MEX value for Alice and minimizing it for Bob.

2. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The problem requires simulating the game between Alice and Bob to determine the optimal moves. The function `func_1` does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, nor does it consider their strategies to maximize/minimize the MEX value.

3. **MEX Calculation**: The function attempts to print the first integer that meets certain conditions, but this does not reflect the optimal strategy for the game. The goal should be to ensure that the resulting array `c` has the highest possible MEX value after both players have made their optimal moves.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to understand that Alice will always pick elements that help her maximize the MEX value, while Bob will try to minimize it. This involves a more complex simulation of the game, considering the sequence of moves and the resulting array `c`.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
