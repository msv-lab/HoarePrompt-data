### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to confirm this conclusion.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by picking an element from `a` and appending it to `c`, then deleting it from `a`.
- Bob then picks an element from `a` and deletes it.
- The game continues until `a` is empty.
- The goal is to find the MEX of `c` if both players play optimally.

#### Given Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and updates the frequency array.
   - It then iterates through the frequency array to determine the MEX value:
     - If any element appears exactly once (`freq[i] == 1`), it increments the counter `cou`.
     - If `cou` reaches 2 or if any element does not appear at all (`freq[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

#### Correctness Check
- The function `func_1` does not simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
- It simply counts the frequency of each element in `arr` and determines the MEX based on these counts.
- This approach does not consider the optimal strategy for both players.

#### Example Test Case Analysis
Consider the example test case:
```
4
0 0 1 1
```

- Alice will pick an element from `a` and append it to `c`. Since Alice goes first, she can pick either `0` or `1`.
- If Alice picks `0`, then `c = [0]` and `a = [0, 1]`.
- Bob will then pick an element from `a` and delete it. He can pick either `0` or `1`.
- If Bob picks `0`, then `c = [0]` and `a = [1]`.
- Alice will then pick `1` and append it to `c`, making `c = [0, 1]`.
- The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`.

However, the given function does not simulate these steps and instead just counts frequencies, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate.
