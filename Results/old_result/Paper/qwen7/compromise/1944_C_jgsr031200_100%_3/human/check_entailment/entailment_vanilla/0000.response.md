Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Determine the final MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the array `c` after both players play optimally.
2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`, then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

### Code Analysis

1. **Imports**:
   ```python
   import math as m
   import collections as c
   ```
   These imports are not used in the actual code, so they can be removed.

2. **Unnecessary Functions**:
   ```python
   def build_tree(n, arr):
       ...
   def bs(arr, x):
       ...
   def kadane(arr):
       ...
   def dfs(root, par, tree):
       ...
   ```
   These functions are not used in the code and can be removed.

3. **Main Code**:
   ```python
   big = 1000000007
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       n = int(input())
       arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
       func_1(arr)
   ```

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(arr):
       freq = [0] * (n + 1)
       for i in arr:
           freq[i] += 1
       cou = 0
       for i in range(n + 1):
           if freq[i] >= 2:
               continue
           if freq[i] == 1:
               cou += 1
           if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
               print(i)
               break
   ```

### Issues in the Code

1. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The frequency array `freq` is initialized to count occurrences of elements in `arr`. This is a good start, but the logic in `func_1` is flawed.

2. **Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The current logic in `func_1` only counts the number of unique elements and checks for the first element that appears exactly once or zero times. This does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
   - The function should simulate the game to determine the optimal moves for both players.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and determine the optimal moves for both players. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's Moves**:
   - Alice will always pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will pick the largest available element to minimize the MEX.

2. **Track Picked Elements**:
   - Use two lists to track elements picked by Alice and Bob.

3. **Determine MEX**:
   - After all elements are picked, compute the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    alice_picks = []
    bob_picks = []
    
    i = 0
    j = n - 1
    
    while i <= j:
        if i == j:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                alice_picks.append(arr[i])
            else:
                bob_picks.append(arr[i])
            break
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            alice_picks.append(arr[i])
            bob_picks.append(arr[j])
        else:
            bob_picks.append(arr[j])
            alice_picks.append(arr[i])
        
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    
    c = alice_picks + bob_picks
    c.sort()
    
    mex = 0
    for num in c:
        if num != mex:
            break
        mex += 1
    
    print(mex)
```

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game and determine the optimal moves for both players. Therefore, the given code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
