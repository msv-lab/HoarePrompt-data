Reasoning:
1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and checking if an element is greater than the previous element and greater than 10. If so, it splits the element into its constituent digits and reinserts them into the array.
2. However, the core logic of the program is flawed. The program does not actually perform the digit splitting operation as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply checks if the array is sorted after the initial input.
3. The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list is sorted in ascending order, but this check is performed only once after the initial input, without performing the digit splitting operations as required by the problem.
4. The program does not implement the digit splitting operation, which is a crucial part of the problem's requirements. Therefore, it cannot correctly determine if the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the digit splitting operation.

Correctness: **False**
