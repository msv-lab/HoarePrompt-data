You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' is sorted in ascending order, which is the same as 'sorted_lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`lst`) where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. It returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous element and the previous element is greater than or equal to 10, the program performs the specified operation:
     - It removes the current element.
     - It inserts the digits of the removed element into the array in the same position.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing the array, the program calls a function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling:**
   - The program assumes that performing the operation will always lead to a sorted array, but this is not necessarily true.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. After the first operation, it becomes `[12, 4, 5, 67]`, and after the second operation, it becomes `[1, 2, 4, 5, 67]`. However, the array is not sorted yet, and further operations might not sort it correctly.

2. **Lack of Correctness in Logic:**
   - The program does not ensure that the array can be made sorted through the allowed operations. It only checks if the final array is sorted, which is insufficient.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential:**
   - There is no mechanism to prevent an infinite loop if the operations do not lead to a sorted array. The program may repeatedly perform the same operations without converging to a sorted state.

### Conclusion

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
