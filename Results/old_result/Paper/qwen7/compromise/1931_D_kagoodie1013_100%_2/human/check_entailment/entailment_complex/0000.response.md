Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into tokens. It then processes each test case by extracting the necessary parameters (n, x, y, and the array elements).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program initializes a counter (`count`) and a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the occurrences of the pairs `(r_x, r_y)`.

3. **Calculating Residues**: For each element in the array, the program calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
   - `r_x = -num % x`: This ensures that `r_x` is within the range `[0, x-1]`.
   - `r_y = num % y`: This directly gives the residue of `num` when divided by `y`.

4. **Counting Pairs**: The program uses the `residue_map` to count the number of times a particular pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before. If the pair is seen for the first time, it is added to the map with a count of 1. If the pair is already in the map, its count is incremented.

5. **Updating Count**: For each element, the program updates the `count` by adding the number of times the current pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before.

6. **Appending Result**: After processing all elements in the array, the `count` is appended to the `results` list.

7. **Returning Results**: Finally, the program returns the `results` list, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the logic and the state analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
