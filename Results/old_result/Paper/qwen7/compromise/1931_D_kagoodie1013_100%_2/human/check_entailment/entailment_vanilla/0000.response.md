Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens.
   - It then processes the input to extract test cases and their respective arrays.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then extracts the array \( arr \) of length \( n \).

3. **Finding Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the residues of each element modulo \( x \) and \( y \).
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues and uses these to find pairs that satisfy the conditions.
   - Specifically, for each element, it checks if there exists another element with the same residues modulo \( x \) and \( y \).

4. **Counting Pairs**:
   - The count of such pairs is accumulated in the variable `count`.
   - The final count for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Residue Calculation**:
   - The calculation of residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` ensures that we correctly handle negative numbers and find the correct residues.
   - This approach is correct because `-num % x` effectively computes the positive remainder when \(-num\) is divided by \(x\).

2. **Dictionary Usage**:
   - The use of a dictionary to store and count occurrences of residues is efficient and correct.
   - The key `(r_x, r_y)` uniquely identifies each combination of residues, ensuring accurate counting of pairs.

3. **Pair Counting Logic**:
   - The logic for counting pairs is sound. For each element, it checks if there exists another element with the same residues, which directly translates to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
