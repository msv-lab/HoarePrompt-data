Output State: **`count` is `residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0) + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(-num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(-num % x, num % y)` and value 2, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The line `r_y = num % y` simply assigns the value of `num % y` to `r_y`. Since `r_y` was already defined as `num % y` before this line, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
