Output State: **`results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the total count of occurrences of each unique pair \((r_x, r_y)\) found across all arrays \(arr\) in `test_cases` according to the given conditions; `count` is the cumulative sum of these occurrences for each unique pair; `r_x` and `r_y` reflect the last computed values from the entire loop execution; `current_key` represents the last key computed; `residue_map` is a dictionary containing all unique \((r_x, r_y)\) pairs encountered during the loop, along with their frequencies; `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the last values from the final tuple in `test_cases`.**

This means that after the loop has executed for all iterations, `results` will contain the final counts for each unique combination of \((r_x, r_y)\) pairs derived from all the input arrays \(arr\). The `count` variable will hold the total sum of these counts across all iterations. The `residue_map` will capture the frequency of each unique \((r_x, r_y)\) pair seen throughout the processing of all test cases.
