Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each `num` in `arr`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is `0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0)`
   - `results` contains the value of `count`
   - `r_x` is `-num % x`
   - `r_y` is `num % y`
   - `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`
   - `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `current_key` and value 1
   - `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`
   - `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`
   - `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`
   - `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `num` will be the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `x` will be the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `y` will be the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `arr` will be the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

Since the loop is iterating over `arr`, the value of `num` will change to the next element in `arr` for the next iteration.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `num` will be updated to the next element in `arr`.
   - `x` and `y` will be updated based on the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `arr` will remain the same for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0), `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `current_key` and value 1, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
