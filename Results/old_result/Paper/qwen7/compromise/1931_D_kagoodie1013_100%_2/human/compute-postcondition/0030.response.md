Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` and `current_key` are calculated based on the last `num` processed, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

The code updates `r_x` to be `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
