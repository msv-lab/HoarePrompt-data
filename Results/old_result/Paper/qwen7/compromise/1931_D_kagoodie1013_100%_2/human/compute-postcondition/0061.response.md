Output State: **`count` is the original value of `count` plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` having a value of 1 more than its previous value, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code increments `count` by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. Since `r_x` and `r_y` are defined as `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively, their values remain unchanged. The `residue_map` dictionary's value for the key `(r_x, r_y)` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`current_key`, `num`, `x`, `y`, `arr`) remain as they were before the code was executed.
