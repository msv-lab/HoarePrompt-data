State: **`count` is 0, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the last `num` processed, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` corresponding to the last `num`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
- The only variable that changes within the loop is `num`, which is initialized to the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `num` is set to the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

The other variables (`count`, `results`, `r_x`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `residue_map`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) are either constants or do not affect the loop's ability to execute. Hence, they do not need to be adjusted.
