Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is 0 plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`
   - `r_x` is `-num % x`
   - `r_y` is `num % y`
   - `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`
   - `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` having a value of 1 more than its previous value
   - `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`
   - `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`
   - `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`
   - `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `num` will be set to the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `x` will be set to the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `y` will be set to the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `arr` will be set to the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `count` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the loop head variables.
- `r_x` will be updated based on the new `num`.
- `r_y` will be updated based on the new `num`.
- `current_key` will be updated based on the new `num`.
- `residue_map` will be updated if the new `current_key` exists in the map.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`count` is 0 plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` having a value of 1 more than its previous value, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
