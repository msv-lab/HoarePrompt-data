Output State: **`count` is `residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0) + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(num % x, num % y)` and value 2, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The line `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` increments the count for the current key in the `residue_map` dictionary by 1. Since the initial value of the key `(num % x, num % y)` in the `residue_map` was 1 (from the initial state), after incrementing it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
