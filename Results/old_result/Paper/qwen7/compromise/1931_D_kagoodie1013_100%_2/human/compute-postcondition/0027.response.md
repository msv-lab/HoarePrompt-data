Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the last `num` processed, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` corresponding to the last `num`, `residue_map` contains counts of all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop execution, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code simply sets `count` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
