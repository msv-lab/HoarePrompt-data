Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `count` will be the sum of all values in `residue_map.values()`, `r_x` and `r_y` will be calculated based on the last `num` processed, `current_key` will be `(num % x, num % y)` corresponding to the last `num`, and `residue_map` will contain counts of all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop execution.**

This means that `count` will reflect the total occurrences of specific `(r_x, r_y)` pairs seen throughout the loop. The `r_x` and `r_y` values will be derived from the last number processed in `arr`. The `current_key` will be the last `(r_x, r_y)` pair evaluated. Finally, `residue_map` will store how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the input array `arr`.
