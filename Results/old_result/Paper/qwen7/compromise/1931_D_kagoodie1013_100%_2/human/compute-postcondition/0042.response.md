Output State: **`count` is `residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0) + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(-num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(-num % x, num % y)` and value 2, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r_x` to `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `r_x` is now `-num % x`, which is a specific calculation based on the current value of `num` and `x`. The other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
