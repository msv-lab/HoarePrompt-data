Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. It simply returns `s[:k] * n`, which means it repeats the first `k` characters of the full alphabet string `n` times. This does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`.

3. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (`n=1`, `k=2`), the expected output is "ab" because both 'a' and 'b' should be subsequences of the string. The program would output "abb" (or "aab"), which is incorrect.
   - For the second test case (`n=2`, `k=1`), the expected output is "aa". The program would output "aaaa", which is incorrect.
   - For the third test case (`n=2`, `k=2`), the expected output is "baab". The program would output "baabbaabbaab", which is incorrect.
   - For the fourth test case (`n=2`, `k=3`), the expected output is "abcbac". The program would output "abcabcabcabc", which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate a string `s` where all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
