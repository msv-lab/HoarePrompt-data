### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in `s`. The goal is to minimize the length of `s`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - In `func_1()`, it reads `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It generates a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times and returns this string.

3. **Analysis of the Approach**:
   - The approach taken by the code is to create a string `s` that contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times.
   - This string `s` will indeed contain all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets because every combination of `n` characters from these `k` alphabets will appear somewhere in the string due to its construction.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and any `k`, the generated string will contain all single characters from the first `k` alphabets.
   - For `n > 1` and any `k`, the generated string will contain all combinations of length `n` from the first `k` alphabets as subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The approach ensures that the generated string `s` meets the requirement of having all possible subsequences of length `n` from the first `k` alphabets.
   - The length of the string `s` is minimized as it is constructed to be exactly `n * k` characters long, which is the minimum possible length to ensure all required subsequences exist.
