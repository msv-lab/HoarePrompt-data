Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `ans` is equal to `i`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in arr:`.
   - The loop variable `i` is being assigned the value of each element in the list `arr`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is being reassigned to the next element in the list `arr` at the start of each iteration, we need to determine what `i` will be in the next iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `i` was set to the first element of `arr`. For the next iteration, `i` will be set to the second element of `arr`.
   - The list `arr` remains unchanged, but `ans` should be updated to the new value of `i`.

4. **Updating the State:**
   - `arr` remains the same list of integers.
   - `i` will now be the second element of `arr`.
   - `ans` will be updated to the second element of `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `ans` is equal to the second element of `arr`**.
