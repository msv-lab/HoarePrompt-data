Postcondition: `c` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `n - 1`. Depending on whether `s[k]` equals 'L', `ans` is either updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD` with `l` incremented by 1, or `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD` with `r` decremented by 1.
