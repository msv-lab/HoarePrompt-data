Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `r = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `arr`, `i`, `ans`, `res[0]`, `c`, and `l` remain unchanged.
