Output State: **`ans` is the result of `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is `c + 1`, `k` is `k + 1` and k is less than `n - 1`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `r` is `r - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables (`ans`, `c`, `k`, and `res[c]`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
