Postcondition: `s` is a string, `k` is an index within the string `s`, `ans` is updated as follows: if the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', then `ans` is the result of `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. After updating `ans`, `l` is increased by 1. If the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L', then `ans` is the value of `ans` divided by `arr[r]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. After updating `ans`, `r` is decreased by 1, and `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`.
