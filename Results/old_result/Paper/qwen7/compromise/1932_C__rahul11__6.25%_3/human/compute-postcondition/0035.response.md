Output State: **`ans` is the result of `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by performing integer division (`//`) of `ans` by `arr[r]` and then taking the modulus (`%`) with `MOD`. The values of `c` and `k` are not affected by this operation, so they remain increased by 1. The exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `ans`, `arr[r]`, and `MOD`, but it is updated according to the given operation.
