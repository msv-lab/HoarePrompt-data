Output State: `arr` is a non-empty list, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`.

Explanation: The loop multiplies each element of the list `arr` to the variable `ans`. After all iterations, `ans` will hold the product of all elements in `arr`. The variable `i` will be set to the last element of `arr` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
