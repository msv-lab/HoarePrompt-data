Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `ans` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is multiplied by `i`, where `i` is the first element of the list `arr`. Since no initial value for `ans` was given, we assume it to be 1 (common default in such cases). Therefore, `ans` becomes `i`. The list `arr` and its first element `i` remain unchanged.
