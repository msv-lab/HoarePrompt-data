Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (a positive integer between 1 and 10^4), n and m (positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), an array a (a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all i), and a string s (a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). The function returns a result based on the given parameters.**
