Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, and the character at index `k` of `s` is not 'L', `ans` is undefined, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `r` is `-1`.**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that the initial value of `r` was not specified, it could be any value, but after the operation, `r` is now `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
