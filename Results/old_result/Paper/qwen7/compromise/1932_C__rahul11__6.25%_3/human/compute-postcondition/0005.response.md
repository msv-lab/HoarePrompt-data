Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `res` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
