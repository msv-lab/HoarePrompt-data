Output State: **`ans` is `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `i` is the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` (which is initially 1) by the value of `i` (the first element of `arr`). Since `ans` was initially 1, multiplying it by `i` results in `ans` becoming `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
