Postcondition: `s` is a string, `k` is an index within the string `s`, `ans` is the result of either `ans // arr[l] % MOD` or `ans // arr[r] % MOD` depending on whether the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L' or not. `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`. If the character at index `k` is 'L', `l` is increased by 1; otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1.
