You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Example

Input

    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000
    
    R

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the product of the array elements exceeds the modulus `m`. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all elements in the array once and then updates this product as elements are removed. However, if the product of the remaining elements exceeds `m`, the program will still compute the result modulo `m` and then again modulo `MOD`, which is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect results.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 10
  3 1 4 2
  LRRL
  ```

The expected output should be:
```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program will fail because it does not correctly handle the product exceeding `m`. For example, when the product is `24` (which is `3 * 1 * 4 * 2`), the program will compute `24 % 10 = 4` and then `4 % (10**9 + 6) = 4`, which is correct. But when the product is updated after removing elements, the program should recompute the product modulo `m` instead of using the previously computed value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = []
        prod = 1
        for i in range(n):
            prod = (prod * arr[i]) % m
            res.append(prod)
            if s[i] == 'L':
                arr.pop(0)
            else:
                arr.pop()
        print(*res)
```

This corrected version ensures that the product is recomputed modulo `m` after each removal, ensuring the correct results for all cases.
