You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes a positive integer \( n \), another positive integer \( m \), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It calculates a result array \( res \) where each element \( res[i] \) is computed based on the product of elements in \( a \) and the direction specified in \( s \). Specifically, for each character in \( s \), if the character is 'L', it divides the current product by the leftmost element in \( a \) and updates the result array; if the character is 'R', it divides the current product by the rightmost element in \( a \) and updates the result array. Finally, it prints the result array for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `MOD` to \(10^9 + 6\).
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `arr` and the string `s`.

2. **Result Array Initialization:**
   - An array `res` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - A variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which will store the running product of the array elements modulo `m`.

3. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of all elements in `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It then takes this product modulo `m` and stores the result in `res[0]`.

4. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and processes each command.
   - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element of `arr` (at index `l`) and updates `ans` modulo `m`.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element of `arr` (at index `r`) and updates `ans` modulo `m`.
   - After updating `ans`, it stores the new value in `res[c]` and increments the counter `c`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the division by zero if the array becomes empty before processing all commands.
   - The modulo operation is applied twice (`ans % m % MOD`) to ensure the result fits within the specified constraints.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The initial product calculation should be done using the elements of `arr` directly, but the code multiplies all elements together and then takes the modulo. This can lead to overflow issues for large products.
   - Instead, the product should be calculated iteratively while taking modulo `m` to avoid overflow.

2. **Incorrect Indexing:**
   - The indices `l` and `r` are used to track the leftmost and rightmost elements, but they are not updated correctly during the loop.
   - The loop should start from the second element (index 1) and update the product accordingly.

3. **Output Order:**
   - The program prints the results in the wrong order. It should print the results in the order they are computed, not in reverse order.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = []
        ans = 1
        for i in range(n):
            ans = (ans * arr[i]) % m
            res.append(ans)
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], -1, m)) % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], -1, m)) % m
                r -= 1
            res[c] = ans
            c += 1
        print(*res)
```

After analyzing the original program and making the necessary corrections, the final program is now correct according to the problem description.
