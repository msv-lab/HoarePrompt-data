Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and strings `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a total length not exceeding 10^6. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for `n` and `s` for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not detailed here as per the instruction to focus only on the parameters and return values.
