Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`, and the variable `ele` is used to hold the current element during each iteration.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - `ele` is the second element in `lst`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is the second element in `lst`, the next element in `lst` will be the third element.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

Given these points, we need to update the state such that `ele` is now the third element in `lst`. 

Here is the modified state:

State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`**
