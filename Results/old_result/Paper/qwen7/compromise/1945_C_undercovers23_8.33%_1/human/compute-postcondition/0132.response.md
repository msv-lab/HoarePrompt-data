Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 5, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 25, and `lst` contains the values 3, 4, and 5 up to `n-1`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` must still be greater than 5. The variable `zero` remains at 2, meaning there were 2 zeros encountered in the string `s` up to the point where `i` was `n-1`. `zero_perc` is still 50, as it represents the percentage of zeros seen so far. The variable `one` is 1, indicating that there was exactly one '1' encountered in the string `s` up to the point where `i` was `n-1`. `one_perc` is now 25, reflecting the percentage of ones seen so far. Finally, the list `lst` contains all the indices from 3 up to `n-1` where the conditions for appending to `lst` were met, which were when both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50.
