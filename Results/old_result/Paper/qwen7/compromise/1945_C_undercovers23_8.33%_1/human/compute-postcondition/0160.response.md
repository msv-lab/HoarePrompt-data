Postcondition: `mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.
