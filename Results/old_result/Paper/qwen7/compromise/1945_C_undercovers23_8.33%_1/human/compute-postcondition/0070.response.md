Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in lst:`. This means the only variable being modified within the loop is `elem`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `final` is a list with one additional element `elem`.
   - `pk` and `mini` are unchanged.
   - `elem` is the next element in `lst`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` must be the next element in `lst`. Since `elem` is already the next element in `lst` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop can continue.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `final` will now include two additional elements (the previous `elem` plus the new `elem`).
   - `pk` and `mini` remain unchanged.
   - `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`final` is a list with two additional elements, `pk` and `mini` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `lst`**.
