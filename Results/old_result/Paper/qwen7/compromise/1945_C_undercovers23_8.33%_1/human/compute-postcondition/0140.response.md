Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - 5)`, `ele` is 5.**

Explanation: Given that the loop runs `n-1` times and `n` is greater than 5, the loop will run at least 4 times (since `i` starts from `n-1` and `n-1` is the starting point). The last element in `lst` is 5, and the loop updates `mini` with the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. Therefore, after all iterations, `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - 5)`, and `ele` will be the last element in `lst`, which is 5.
