Output State: **`pk` is `n // 2`, `n` is an input integer and the current value of `n` is even, `s` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `pk = n // 2` assigns the value of `n // 2` (integer division of `n` by 2) to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is specified to be an even number, the value of `pk` will be half of `n`. The other variables `s` and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
