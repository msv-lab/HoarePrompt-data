Output State: **`final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference from `pk` as the minimum difference found during the loop execution. `mini` remains unchanged, and `pk` remains unchanged.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have been executed, `final` will contain every element from `lst` that has the same absolute difference from `pk` as the smallest such difference encountered during the loop. The values of `mini` and `pk` do not change throughout the loop's execution.
