Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `ele` remains 5, `final` is an empty list, `_` is 8, `pk` is `n // 2`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `mini` to `100000000` (which is `pow(10, 8)`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
