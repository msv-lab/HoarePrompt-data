Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1, otherwise `one` is 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)) which results in 0 since `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given that `i` is 0, the denominator `(i + 1)` becomes 1. Since `zero` is either 1 (if the first character of `s` is '0') or 1 (if the first character is not '0'), the calculation simplifies to `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 1)`, which is `100`. However, since `i` is 0, the correct calculation is `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 1)`, resulting in `100`, but due to the initial condition of `i` being 0, the result is effectively 0. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
