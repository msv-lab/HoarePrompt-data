To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The `final` list is either `[0]` with a length of 1, `[n]` with a length of 1, or `[0]` with a length of 1 depending on the value of `c1`.
   - If `c1` is 50 or greater, the `final` list is `[0]`.
   - If `c1` is 0, the `final` list is `[n]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(final[0])` will print the first element of the `final` list.

Given these conditions, we need to consider the possible values of `c1`:

- If `c1` is 50 or greater, `final` is `[0]`, so `final[0]` is `0`.
- If `c1` is 0, `final` is `[n]`, so `final[0]` is `n`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `c1`, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the print statement will always print the first element of the `final` list.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `c1`:

- If `c1` is 50 or greater, the output will be `0`.
- If `c1` is 0, the output will be `n`.

Given the format requirement, we need to provide a general answer that covers both possibilities:

Output: **0 if c1 is 50 or greater, n if c1 is 0**
