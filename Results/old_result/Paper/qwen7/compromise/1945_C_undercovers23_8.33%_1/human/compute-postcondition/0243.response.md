Output State: **`c1` is 50 or greater; the final list is [0]; the length of the final list is 1.**

The code `final.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `final`. Initially, `final` is an empty list, and its length is `0`. After appending `0`, the list `final` becomes `[0]`, and its length is `1`. The value of `c1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
