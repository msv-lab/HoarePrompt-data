Output State: **`mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and `final` is sorted; `final` now includes the value of `n`; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50.**

The code `final.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `final`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `final`, which now contains all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and `n` is added to this list.
