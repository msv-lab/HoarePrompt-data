Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. This means that `mini` will now hold the smallest value found between its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The list `lst` remains unchanged, and the condition that it must contain at least one element is still valid.
