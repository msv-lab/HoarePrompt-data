Output State: **`final` is an empty list, `mini` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`**.

This means that the variable `c1` has been calculated as the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`. The other variables (`final`, `mini`, and `pk`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
