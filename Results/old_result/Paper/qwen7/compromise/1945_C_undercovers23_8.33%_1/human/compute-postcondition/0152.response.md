Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **Postcondition**: After the previous iteration:
  - `lst` contains all its original elements plus the element `elem`.
  - `final` remains unchanged.
  - `pk` and `mini` remain the same.

- **Loop Statement**:
  ```python
  for elem in lst:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**:
   - The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `elem`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
   - Each iteration adds the current `elem` to `lst`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `lst`, the value of `elem` changes with each iteration.
   - The postcondition tells us that `lst` contains all its original elements plus the current `elem`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `lst`: It will contain all its original elements plus the next element (which is the current `elem`).
   - `final`, `pk`, and `mini`: These remain unchanged as per the postcondition.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in `lst`, and the other variables (`final`, `pk`, and `mini`) will remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` contains all its original elements plus the next element, `final` remains unchanged, `pk` and `mini` remain the same.**
