Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`.**

This means that after the loop has executed for all iterations, `mini` will have been updated to the smallest value among the initial `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and every element in `lst`. The variable `ele` stays constant at 5 throughout the process. The `final` list will include every element from the original `lst` that matches the condition where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals the final value of `mini`.
