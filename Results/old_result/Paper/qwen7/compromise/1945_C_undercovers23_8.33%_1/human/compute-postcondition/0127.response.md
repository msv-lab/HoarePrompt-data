Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 5, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0, `one` is 1, and `lst` contains the values 3 and 4.**

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to the ceiling value of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`. Given the initial state, `zero` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is 4. If `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` would be 50 (since `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 5) = 20` which rounds up to 50). If `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` would also be 50 (since `math.ceil(2 * 100 / 5) = 40` which rounds up to 50). Since `zero` is set to 2 when `s[i]` equals '0', and `i` is 4, `zero` is updated to 2, and `zero_perc` is calculated as 50. All other variables remain unchanged.
