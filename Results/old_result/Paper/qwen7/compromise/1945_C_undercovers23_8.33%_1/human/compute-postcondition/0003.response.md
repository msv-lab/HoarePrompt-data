Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the string input by the user to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
