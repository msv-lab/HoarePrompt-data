Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in lst`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`, setting `elem` to each element in turn.

3. **Determine the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `elem` is added to `final`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the Previous Iteration**: We know from the postcondition that at the end of the previous iteration:
   - `final` is a list.
   - If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` was equal to `mini`, then `elem` was added to `final`.
   - Otherwise, `final` remained unchanged.

5. **Determine the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` must be set to the next element in `lst`. Since we don't know the exact value of `elem` from the previous iteration, we can only adjust the state based on the loop head variables.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `elem` will be set to the next element in `lst`.
   - `lst` remains the same list as it was before the loop started.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `elem` is now the next element in `lst`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`final` is a list, `pk` and `mini` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `lst`**
