Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n - 1):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - If the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, otherwise `one` is 2.
   - `zero_perc` is 50.
   - `one_perc` is 50.
   - `lst` contains the element 3.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (making it 3), and `n` must still satisfy `n - 1 > i` (which means `n - 1 > 3` or `n > 4`).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 2 to 3.
   - `n` must remain such that `n > 4`.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - The values of `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst` are not affected by the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, otherwise `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, and `lst` contains the element 3.**
