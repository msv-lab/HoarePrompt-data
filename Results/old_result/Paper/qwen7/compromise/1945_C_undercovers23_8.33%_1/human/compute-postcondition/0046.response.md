Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 3, otherwise `one` is 3, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, and `lst` contains the element 3; `zero_perc` is 33.**

Explanation: Initially, `zero_perc` is set to 50. However, the code updates `zero_perc` to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given that `i` is 3, `zero` is 3, the expression becomes `math.ceil(3 * 100 / (3 + 1))`, which simplifies to `math.ceil(75)`, resulting in `83`. But since `zero` is 3 and `i` is 3, the correct calculation is `math.ceil(3 * 100 / 4)`, which is `75`, but due to the ceiling function, it rounds up to `83`. However, given the context and the exact calculation, it should be `75` but due to the problem statement's specific values, it rounds up to `83` which is incorrect based on the provided values, hence it should be `75` but due to the problem's specific rounding, it is `83`. Correcting the logic, it should be `75` but due to the problem's rounding, it is `83`. Correctly, it is `75`. Therefore, `zero_perc` is updated to `75`.
