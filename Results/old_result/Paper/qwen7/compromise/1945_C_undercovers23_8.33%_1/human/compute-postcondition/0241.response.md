Output State: **`c1` is 0, the final list is sorted, and the length of the final list is 0.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that the final list is sorted and its length is 0. The code snippet `c1 = o * 100 // n` involves the variables `o` and `n`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `o` and `n`, and the operation `o * 100 // n` results in 0 (assuming `o` and `n` are such that their multiplication and subsequent integer division yield 0), `c1` is assigned the value 0. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
