Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1, otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `zero` or `one` is 1 depending on the first character of `s`. 
- `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, which is `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 1)` resulting in `100`. However, due to the condition given (`zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)) which results in 0 since `i` is 0`), `zero_perc` remains `0`.
- The code then calculates `one_perc` as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Since `i` is 0 and `one` is 1, and assuming `o` is the count of '1's in `s` (which is not specified but does not affect the calculation as `one` is already defined), `one_perc` is calculated using the updated values. Given `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `one` is 1, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - 1) * 100 / (n - 0 - 1))` which simplifies to `math.ceil((o - 1) * 100 / (n - 1))`. This expression is left as is because the exact value of `o` and `n` is not specified, but it is clear that `one_perc` is dependent on these values.
