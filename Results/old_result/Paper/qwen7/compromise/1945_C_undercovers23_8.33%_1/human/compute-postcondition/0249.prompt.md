Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n // 2
    else:
        pk = n // 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
        one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `final` is a list, `mini` remains unchanged, and `pk` remains unchanged. If `len(final)` is 0, then `final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `['n']` if `c1` is less than 50.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and `final` is sorted. If `len(final)` is 0, `final` will contain either [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or it will include the value of `n` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final list is either [0] with a length of 1, [n] with a length of 1, or [0] with a length of 1 depending on the value of `c1`. If `c1` is 50 or greater, the final list is [0]. If `c1` is 0, the final list is [n].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
