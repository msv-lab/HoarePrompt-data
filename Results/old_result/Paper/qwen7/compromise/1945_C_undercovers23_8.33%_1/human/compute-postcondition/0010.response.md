Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `pk` is defined as `n // 2`, and `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `sl = list(s)` converts the string `s` into a list of its characters and assigns this list to the variable `sl`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `pk` remain unchanged from their initial states.
