Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, `zero_perc` is 33, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 33, `lst` contains the value 3. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then the function updates `lst` to contain the value 3.
