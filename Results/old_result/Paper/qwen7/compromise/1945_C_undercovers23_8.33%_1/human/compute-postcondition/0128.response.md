Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 5, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 25, `one` is 1, and `lst` contains the values 3 and 4.**

Explanation: The code updates `one_perc` to the value of `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Given the initial state, `o` (which is the same as `zero`) is 2, `one` is 1, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 5. Plugging these values into the formula gives `math.ceil((2 - 1) * 100 / (n - 4 - 1)) = math.ceil(1 * 100 / (n - 5))`. Since `n` is greater than 5, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 6 (though any value greater than 5 would work, the smallest is used for simplicity). This gives `math.ceil(100 / 1) = 100 / 1 = 100`, but since `math.ceil` rounds up, the result is 100/4 = 25. Therefore, `one_perc` is updated to 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
