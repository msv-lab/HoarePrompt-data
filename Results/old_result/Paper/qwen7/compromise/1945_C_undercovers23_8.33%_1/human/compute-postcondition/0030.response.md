Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - If the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1, otherwise `one` is 1.
   - `zero_perc` is 0.
   - `one_perc` is 50.
   - The condition `(zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50)` is true.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged, but it must still satisfy the condition `n >= 1`.
   - The values of `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1, otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 50**.
