Output State: **`score` is 0, `start_pos` is an integer representing the starting position (either P_B or P_S), `current_pos` is `start_pos`, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ start_pos ≤ n and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of n integers representing the array a.**

The variable `current_pos` is assigned the value of `start_pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
