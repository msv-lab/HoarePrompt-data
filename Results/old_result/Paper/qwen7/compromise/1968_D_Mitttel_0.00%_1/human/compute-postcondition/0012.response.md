Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5), k (an integer between 1 and 10^9), PB and PS (integers between 1 and n), p (a list of n unique integers ranging from 1 to n representing a permutation), and a (a list of n integers each ranging from 1 to 10^9). Based on these inputs, the function returns either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on the specific conditions defined by the problem.**
