Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers. The absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the element of `b` at the index `n` is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the element of `b` at the same index `i`.
