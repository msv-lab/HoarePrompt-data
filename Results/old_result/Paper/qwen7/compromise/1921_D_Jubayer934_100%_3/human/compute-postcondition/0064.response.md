Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is either -1 or the index where the condition was met, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and `b` in the order they were processed.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have incremented to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `temp` will either remain `-1` if the `if` condition inside the loop never evaluates to `True` for any `i`, or it will be set to the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first satisfied. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`, appended in the order the loop iterated through `a`.
