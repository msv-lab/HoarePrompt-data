Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two lists a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function evaluates n and m and returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing specific parameters, and process them according to the given constraints and relationships without returning anything explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet.
