Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list of the first `n` sorted integers from the input, and these integers are converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list, and then takes the first `n` elements from this sorted list. The original values of `m` and `temp` remain unchanged, and `ans` is updated to be a list containing the first `n` sorted integers from the input.
