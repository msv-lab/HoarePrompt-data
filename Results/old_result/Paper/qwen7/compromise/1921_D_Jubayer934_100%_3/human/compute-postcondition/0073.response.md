Output State: `ans` now contains `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for every `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1`; `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n`; `temp` is not -1; `n` must be greater than 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between each element of `a` starting from index `temp` to `n-1` and the corresponding element of `b` from the end, which is calculated as `b[-(n - i)]`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes, `temp` remains unchanged and is not -1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.
