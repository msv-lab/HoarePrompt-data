Output State: **`i` is equal to `temp`, `n` must be greater than 0, the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `i`, `temp`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the conditions and values remain the same as the initial state, except that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
