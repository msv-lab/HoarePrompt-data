Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `temp` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` will be `temp - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be `temp - 1` and it must be less than `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` was `temp - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` must remain greater than 0 (as it did not change).
- `temp` is now `i + 1`, which means `temp` is `(temp - 1) + 1 = temp`.
- `ans` will have one more element added, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `i` is now `temp - 1`, the new element added to `ans` is the absolute difference between `a[temp - 1]` and `b[temp - 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans` is a list with two additional elements which are the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the current `i` and the previous `i`**. 

However, to simplify and match the format requested, we can say:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[temp - 1]` and `b[temp - 1]`**.
