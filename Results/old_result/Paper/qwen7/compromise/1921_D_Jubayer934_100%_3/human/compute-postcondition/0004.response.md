Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list of the first `n` sorted integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then sorts these integers. The `[:n]` slice operation ensures only the first `n` elements are taken from the sorted list. These values are then assigned to `a`. Since `a` is now referred to as `ans` in the output state, `ans` holds the first `n` sorted integers entered by the user. The values of `n`, `m`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
