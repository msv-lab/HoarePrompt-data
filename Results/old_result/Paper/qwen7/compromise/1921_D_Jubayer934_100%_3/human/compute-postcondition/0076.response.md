Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n`, `temp` remains `-1`, and `ans` contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. If `temp` is not `-1`, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all valid `i` in the range `[temp, n-1]`.**
