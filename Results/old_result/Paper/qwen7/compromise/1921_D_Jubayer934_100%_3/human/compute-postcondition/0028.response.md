Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `temp`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(temp, n):` will start executing if `temp` is less than `n`.
   - The variable `i` will take values starting from `temp` up to `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `temp` is less than `n` for the loop to start executing.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to `temp`.

Given the initial states:
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers
- `b` is a list of integers
- `temp` is not -1
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b` from index 0 to `n-1` in ascending order.

We need to adjust the states of `i` and `temp` to ensure the loop can start executing.

**State:**
- `i` should be set to `temp`
- `temp` should be less than `n`

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**State: **`i` is `temp`, `temp` must be less than `n`**.
