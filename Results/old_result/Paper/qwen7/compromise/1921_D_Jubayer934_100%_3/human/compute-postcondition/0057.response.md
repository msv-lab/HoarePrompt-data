Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended with the absolute difference of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. No other changes are made to the variables `i` or `n`. The condition mentioned in the postcondition does not affect the current line of code, so `i` remains `n + 1` and `ans` is updated with the new absolute difference.
