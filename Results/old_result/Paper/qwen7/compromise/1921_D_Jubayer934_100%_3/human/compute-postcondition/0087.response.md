Output State: **`temp` is equal to `i`, `n` must be greater than 0, the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at index `-(n - i)` in `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at index `i` in `b`.**

Explanation: The line `temp = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `temp`. No other changes are made to the variables or conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `temp` now holds the value of `i`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
