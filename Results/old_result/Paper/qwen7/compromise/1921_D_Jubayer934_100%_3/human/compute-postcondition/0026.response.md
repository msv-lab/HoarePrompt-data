Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b` from index 0 to `n-1` in ascending order.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `temp` remains `-1` because no break statement was encountered during the loop's execution. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between each element in the list `a` and the corresponding element in the list `b` (from index 0 to `n-1`), sorted in ascending order as the loop appends the differences directly into the list without further sorting.
