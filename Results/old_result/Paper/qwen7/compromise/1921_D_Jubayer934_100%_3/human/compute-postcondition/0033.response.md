Output State: **`ans` now contains the value `abs(a[temp + 2] - b[-(n - (temp + 2))])`, `i` is `temp + 2`, `temp` is less than `n`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `temp + 2`, the expression inside `ans.append()` becomes `abs(a[temp + 2] - b[-(n - (temp + 2))])`. The values of `i`, `temp`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `temp` is less than `n` still holds.
