Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is not greater, the same conditions apply without any change.
