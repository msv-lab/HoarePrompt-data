Output State: **`i` is `temp + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and the second element is the same as the first element.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially had one element (the absolute difference), after appending, `ans` now has two elements, both being the same value. The values of `i`, `n`, and the structure of `ans` are updated accordingly.
