Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `n`, `temp`, or `ans`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
