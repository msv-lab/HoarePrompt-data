Output State: The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b` from index 0 to `n-1` in ascending order, starting from `a[temp]` and ending with `a[n-1]`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `temp` will still be less than `n`, and no new elements will be appended to `ans` since the loop condition `i < n` will no longer be satisfied when `i` reaches `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `ans` will have all the required absolute differences calculated and stored in it, covering indices from `temp` to `n-1`. The variable `i` will have incremented past `n`, and `temp` will still be a value less than `n`.
