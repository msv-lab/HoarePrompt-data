Output State: **`ans` now contains `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n`, `temp` is not -1, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between elements `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `temp`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, except for the addition of the new element to `ans`.
