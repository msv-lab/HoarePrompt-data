Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[temp - 1]` and `b[temp - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `n`, `temp`, or `ans`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
