Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `temp` remains `-1`.
   - `ans` contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. If `temp` is not `-1`, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all valid `i` in the range `[temp, n-1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum(ans))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, and `temp` is `-1`, the condition `temp != -1` is false. Therefore, the list `ans` will only contain the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - The `sum(ans)` will calculate the sum of these absolute differences.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`**
