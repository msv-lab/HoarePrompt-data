The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two lists a and b (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists a and b, considering a specific condition. If a certain condition is met, it adjusts the calculation method. Finally, it prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case.
