Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Test Cases**: The program should handle multiple test cases but only processes one test case per run. It does not loop through all test cases as required.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. Specifically:
   - The condition `if b[-2] != '>'` checks only the second last column of the second row, which is insufficient.
   - The logic for checking if the robot can reach the end involves unnecessary complexity and does not correctly account for the robot's movement pattern.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' directly without considering the format specified in the problem statement (case-insensitive).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the robot can move to the last column
        if b[-1] != '>':
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row
        can_move_down = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == '<' and b[i] == '>':
                can_move_down = False
                break
        
        if can_move_down:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by checking the necessary conditions.
