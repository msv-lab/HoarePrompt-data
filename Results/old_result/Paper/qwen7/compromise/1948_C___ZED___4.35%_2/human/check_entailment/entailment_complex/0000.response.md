Reasoning:
1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates through each test case.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes variables `a` and `b` to store the first and second row of the grid, respectively.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 1` by printing "YES" immediately.
4. **Main Logic**:
   - **Check Second-to-Last Character**: The program checks if the second-to-last character of the second row (`b[-2]`) is `'>'.` This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the robot to reach the end.
   - **Even Length Check**: Since `n` is guaranteed to be even, the program checks every other character starting from index 0 in the second row (`b`). If any of these characters are `'<',` it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - **Odd Length Check**: Similarly, it checks every other character starting from index 1 in the first row (`a`). If any of these characters are `'<',` it also sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - **Final Decision**: If `no_path` remains `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
