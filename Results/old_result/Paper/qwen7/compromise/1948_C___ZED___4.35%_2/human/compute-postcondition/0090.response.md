Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variables that change within the loop. In this case, the loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
   ```
   Here, the variable `k` changes according to the range specified.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `no_path` is `False`
   - `k` is `1`
   - `n` must be an integer such that `1 < n - 1`, meaning `n > 2`
   - The current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop starts with `k = 1` and increments by `2` each time (`k += 2`).
   - The loop continues as long as `k < n - 1`.

4. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `k` is incremented by `2` each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `k` was `1`.
   - For the next iteration, `k` will be `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - The condition `1 < n - 1` still holds true since `n` must be greater than `2`.
   - The value of `a[k]` (which is `a[3]` now) must not be `'>'`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `no_path` remains `False` as there is no indication that it should change.
   - `k` is updated to `3`.
   - `n` remains greater than `2`.
   - The value of `a[k]` (now `a[3]`) must not be `'>'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`no_path` is `False`, `k` is `3`, `n` must be an integer such that `1 < n - 1`, and the current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`**.
