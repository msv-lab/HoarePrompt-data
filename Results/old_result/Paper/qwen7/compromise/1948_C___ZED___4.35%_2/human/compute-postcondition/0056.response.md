Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `b` remains the same as the input string, and `no_path` remains `False`. This is because if `n` equals 1, the `if` part is executed, but since `n` is not 1, the `else` part is executed, setting `n` to an integer greater than or equal to 4 while keeping `i`, `b`, and `no_path` unchanged.
