Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `n`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. The input to `int(input())` is specified to be a valid integer within the range 1 to 10^4, so `n` will be an integer within this range.
