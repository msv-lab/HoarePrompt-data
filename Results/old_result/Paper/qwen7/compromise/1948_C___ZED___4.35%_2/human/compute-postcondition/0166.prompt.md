Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `b` remains the same as the input string, and `no_path` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input string, `no_path` remains `False`, `a` is the input string with `b` updated to the new input string, and if the last second character of `b` is not `'>',` then for all `k` in the sequence `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1`, the value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string, `no_path` remains `False` unless `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and the last second character of `b` is `'>';` in that case, `no_path` becomes `True`, `k` is `n-1`, and the value of `a[n-1]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
