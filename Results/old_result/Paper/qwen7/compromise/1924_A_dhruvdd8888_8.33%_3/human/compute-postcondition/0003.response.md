Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `win`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, or `us`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
