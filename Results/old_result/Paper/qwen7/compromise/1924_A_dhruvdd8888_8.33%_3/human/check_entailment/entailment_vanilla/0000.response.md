Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program starts by generating a random number `rrr` which is not used anywhere in the code.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` and a string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - `func_1()` is defined but never called directly. Instead, it is called indirectly through the loop in the main part of the program.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, it initializes variables `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input.
   - It reads the string `s`.
   - It creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of characters seen so far.
   - It iterates over each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `us`, it adds it to `win`.
     - If `win` has `k` distinct characters, it appends the character to `ans` and resets `win`.
   - After processing the string `s`, it checks if `ps` (which should be the count of unique characters seen in `s`) is at least `n`.
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` using characters from `us` that were not in `win`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ps`**:
   - The variable `ps` is supposed to count the number of unique characters seen in `s` but is not actually used correctly. The logic should ensure that `ps` reflects the number of unique characters processed so far, but it is not being used effectively.

2. **Logic for Constructing `ans`**:
   - The construction of `ans` is flawed. The program tries to use characters from `us` that were not in `win`, but this does not guarantee that the constructed string `ans` will not be a subsequence of `s`. The logic here is not robust enough to handle all edge cases.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called in a loop, but the loop body is empty (`func_1()` is never called). This is a logical error and will cause the program to crash.

### Conclusion

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
