Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` is not properly defined**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the logic for checking subsequences, but it is not correctly implemented.
2. **Incorrect logic for checking subsequences**: The current implementation does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
3. **Incomplete handling of output**: The program does not generate and print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s` when the answer is "NO".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = [0] * k  # Track the last seen position of each character in the alphabet
    ans = [''] * n  # Store the result string

    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in us:
            idx = ord(char) - 97
            win[idx] = i + 1  # Update the last seen position

    # Check if we have seen all characters in the required order
    if all(w > 0 for w in win):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Generate a counterexample
        for i in range(n):
            ans[i] = chr(min((j for j in range(k) if win[j] > 0), default=0) + 97)
        print(''.join(ans))

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Tracking Last Seen Positions**: We use an array `win` to keep track of the last seen positions of each character in the alphabet.
2. **Checking Subsequences**: After processing the string `s`, we check if all characters have been seen in the required order.
3. **Generating Counterexample**: If not all characters are seen, we generate a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

This corrected version should now meet the requirements of the problem.
