Output State: **The program returns -1**

Given the initial state, the value of `k` is reduced by the sum of `(m - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `n` where `a[i] < m`. After performing this operation, if `k` is less than 0, the code returns `-1`. Since the code snippet only includes a `return -1;` statement without any further conditions or operations, the program will unconditionally return `-1`.
