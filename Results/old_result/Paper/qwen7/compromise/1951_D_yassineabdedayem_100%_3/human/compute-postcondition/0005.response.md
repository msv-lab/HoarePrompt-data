Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each involving two positive integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it determines whether certain conditions are met and outputs a result accordingly. If \(n\) equals \(k\), it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1. If \(n + 2\) is greater than \(2k\), it prints 'YES' followed by 2, then \(n - k + 1\), and finally 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.**
