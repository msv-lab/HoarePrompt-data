Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three values: t, n, and k, where t is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers between 1 and \(10^{18}\). The function returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `t`, `n`, and `k` through its execution context, processes them according to some unspecified logic, and returns a result after evaluating these parameters.
