Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a value \(t\) based on certain conditions and prints the final value of \(t\). Initially, \(t\) is set to \(b\), and it is adjusted based on whether \(t \times 15 - b \times 4\) is greater than or equal to \(a\). If not, \(t\) is incremented further depending on the remainder when \(a - t \times 15 + b \times 4\) is divided by 15. The function ultimately outputs the final value of \(t\) for each test case.**
