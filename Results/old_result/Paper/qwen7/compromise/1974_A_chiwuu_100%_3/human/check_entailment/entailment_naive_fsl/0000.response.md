Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, which means they can be placed in the remaining space of a screen after placing 1x1 icons. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input `x = 4` and `y = 2`. According to the problem description, we need to fit 4 one-by-one icons and 2 two-by-two icons. 

- Two 2x2 icons will occupy 8 cells, which can fit into 2 screens since each screen has 15 cells.
- The remaining 4 cells can fit 4 one-by-one icons.

However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:
1. It calculates `t = b` (where `b` is the number of 2x2 icons), which is 2.
2. It then checks if `t1 >= a` (where `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`), but this calculation is incorrect because it does not properly account for the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining space.

In this specific case, the program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`, because it does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
