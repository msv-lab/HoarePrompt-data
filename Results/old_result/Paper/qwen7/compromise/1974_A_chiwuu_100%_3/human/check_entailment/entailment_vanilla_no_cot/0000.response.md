Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of Spaces Needed for 2x2 Icons**: The program calculates `t` as the number of 2x2 icons divided by 2, which is incorrect. A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so you should divide `b` by 4 to get the number of 2x2 icons that fit into the total space.

2. **Space Calculation for Remaining Cells**: After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells need to be filled with 1x1 icons. The program incorrectly calculates the remaining space as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`, which doesn't make sense in this context.

3. **Final Calculation of Screens**: The final calculation of screens (`t`) is also incorrect. It should account for both the 2x2 and 1x1 icons correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of full 2x2 icons that can be placed.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing these icons.
3. Determine how many additional screens are needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Number of full 2x2 icons that can be placed
        full_2x2 = b // 4
        # Remaining space after placing full 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 5 * 3 * full_2x2 - b * 4
        # Number of 1x1 icons that can be placed in the remaining space
        remaining_1x1 = min(remaining_space, a)
        # Remaining 1x1 icons that cannot be placed in the current screen
        remaining_1x1_after_current_screen = a - remaining_1x1
        # Number of additional screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens = (remaining_1x1_after_current_screen + 15 - 1) // 15
        # Total number of screens
        total_screens = full_2x2 + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)
```

This approach ensures that the calculations are correct and accounts for both the 2x2 and 1x1 icons properly.
