Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed.

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
3. **Calculating Initial Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**: 
   - `t = b` initializes the screen count with the number of 2x2 icons.
   - If `b` is odd, it adds an extra screen (`t = t // 2 + 1`), otherwise, it just divides by 2 (`t = t // 2`).
4. **Calculating Remaining Space and Additional Screens Needed for 1x1 Icons**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the total number of cells available in `t` screens minus the space occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is sufficient to accommodate all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), then no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many more screens are needed (`t2 = a - t1`) and adjusts the total screen count accordingly.
5. **Output**: The final value of `t` is printed, which should be the minimum number of screens required.

To verify correctness, we need to check if this logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

### Verification Against Examples:
- **Example 1**: `1 1`
  - `b = 1` requires 1 screen for the 2x2 icon.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a = 1`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `1` (correct).

- **Example 2**: `7 2`
  - `b = 2` requires 1 screen for the 2x2 icons.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, which is greater than `a = 7`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `1` (correct).

- **Example 3**: `12 4`
  - `b = 4` requires 2 screens for the 2x2 icons.
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`, which is greater than `a = 12`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `2` (correct).

- **Example 4**: `0 3`
  - `b = 3` requires 2 screens for the 2x2 icons.
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `2` (correct).

- **Example 5**: `1 0`
  - `b = 0` requires 0 screens for the 2x2 icons.
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a = 1`, so 1 additional screen is needed.
  - Result: `1` (correct).

- **Example 6**: `8 1`
  - `b = 1` requires 1 screen for the 2x2 icon.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a = 8`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `1` (correct).

- **Example 7**: `0 0`
  - `b = 0` requires 0 screens for the 2x2 icons.
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `0` (correct).

- **Example 8**: `2 0`
  - `b = 0` requires 0 screens for the 2x2 icons.
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a = 2`, so 1 additional screen is needed.
  - Result: `1` (correct).

- **Example 9**: `15 0`
  - `b = 0` requires 0 screens for the 2x2 icons.
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a = 15`, so 2 additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `1` (correct).

- **Example 10**: `8 2`
  - `b = 2` requires 1 screen for the 2x2 icons.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, which is less than `a = 8`, so 1 additional screen is needed.
  - Result: `2` (correct).

- **Example 11**: `0 9`
  - `b = 9` requires 5 screens for the 2x2 icons.
  - `t1 = 5 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 45 - 36 = 9`, which is equal to `a = 9`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `5` (correct).

Given the analysis and verification against the examples, the logic in the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
