Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in the function matches the problem statement and the provided examples. Let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Case 1: \(b \leq a\)**  
   - According to the problem, if \(b \leq a\), Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \(a\).  
   - The program correctly prints \(n \times a\), which is the total revenue if all buns are sold at the usual price.

2. **Case 2: \(b - a \geq n\)**  
   - The problem states that if \(b - a \geq n\), Bob should sell the first \(n\) buns at the modified prices from \(b\) to \(b - n + 1\).  
   - The sum of these modified prices is given by the formula \(\frac{(2 \times b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).  
   - The program correctly implements this formula, which is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from \(b\) and ending at \(b - n + 1\).

3. **Case 3: \(b - a < n\)**  
   - Here, Bob should sell the first \(b - a + 1\) buns at the modified prices and the remaining \(n - (b - a + 1)\) buns at the usual price \(a\).  
   - The sum of the modified prices is given by the formula \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).  
   - The remaining buns are sold at the usual price \(a\), contributing \(a \times (n - (b - a + 1))\) to the total revenue.  
   - The program correctly combines these two parts to give the total revenue.

Given the detailed breakdown, the logic in the program aligns perfectly with the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
