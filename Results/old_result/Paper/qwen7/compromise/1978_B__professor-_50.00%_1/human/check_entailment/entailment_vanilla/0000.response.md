### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `n * a`. This means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best option since the modified price `b` is not beneficial.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the program calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n-1)`.
   - Otherwise, the program uses the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` to calculate the profit. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence with the first term `(b - (k-1))` and the last term `b`.

3. **Formula Verification**:
   - For `b - a >= n`, the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` is correct because it represents the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - (n-1)`.
   - For `b - a < n`, the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` is also correct because it accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `b <= a` and when `b - a >= n` correctly.
   - The program also handles the general case where `b - a < n` correctly.

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and test cases.
