Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial conditions for `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this line of code, so they remain unspecified in terms of their values but are known to be positive integers within the range 1 to \(10^9\).
