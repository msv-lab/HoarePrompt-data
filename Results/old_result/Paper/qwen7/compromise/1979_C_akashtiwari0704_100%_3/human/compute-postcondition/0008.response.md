Output State: **`g` is the value of `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `i` is 1, `l` must still have at least 1 element**

Explanation: 
- The variable `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Since `i` is 1, `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 1.
- The list `l` must still have at least one element, which is a precondition that remains valid after the code execution.
