Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` is a positive integer.
- `i` is the last index processed, which means `i = bets - 1`.
- `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.
- Each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` after being used in the calculation of `sumo`.
- The condition `sumo >= prod` is true.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This code simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
