Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `sumo` is 0, `T` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a`, `ans` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input().**

The code sets `sumo` to 0, which is the only change. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
