Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` is a non-empty list**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. It also increments `i` by 1. The list `l` remains unchanged, and it is mentioned that `l` is a non-empty list. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
