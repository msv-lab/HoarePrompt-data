Postcondition: **`bets` is at least the total number of iterations (N), `i` is equal to N, `sumo` is the cumulative sum of `prod // a[i]` for each iteration, each element in the list `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for the corresponding index `i`, and the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
