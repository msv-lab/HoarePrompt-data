Output State: **`i` is 4; `ans` is 'a[0]a[1]a[4]'; `bets` must be greater than or equal to `N`**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Initially, `i` is 3, so `a[i]` refers to `a[3]`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes 4), and `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[3]`. The value of `bets` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
