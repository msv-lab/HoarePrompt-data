Postcondition: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is the last index processed (i.e., `bets - 1`), `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` after being used in the calculation of `sumo`. Additionally, the condition `sumo >= prod` is true.**
