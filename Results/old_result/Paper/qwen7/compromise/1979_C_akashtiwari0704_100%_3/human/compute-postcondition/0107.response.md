Output State: **`bets` must be greater than `N + 2` or `2 * N + 2`, `i` is either `N + 2` or `2 * N + 2`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`**

In this output state, the conditions for `bets` and the value of `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variable `a[i]` is updated to the value of `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is an unspecified value that needs to be known to determine the exact new value of `a[i]`.
