Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < bets`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `N + 1` or `2 * N + 1`.
   - `bets` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is either `N + 1` or `2 * N + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `N + 2` if `i` was `N + 1`, or `2 * N + 2` if `i` was `2 * N + 1`.

4. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.
   - Therefore, `bets` must be greater than `N + 2` if `i` was `N + 1`, or `bets` must be greater than `2 * N + 2` if `i` was `2 * N + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `bets` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given these points, let's formulate the answer:

- If `i` was `N + 1`, then the next value of `i` is `N + 2`, and `bets` must be greater than `N + 2`.
- If `i` was `2 * N + 1`, then the next value of `i` is `2 * N + 2`, and `bets` must be greater than `2 * N + 2`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `N`, we express it in terms of `N`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`bets` must be greater than `N + 2` or `2 * N + 2`, `i` is either `N + 2` or `2 * N + 2`**
