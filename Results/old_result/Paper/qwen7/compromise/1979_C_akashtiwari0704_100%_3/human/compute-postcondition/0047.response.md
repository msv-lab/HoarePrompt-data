Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(l)`.
2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]) * l[i] // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[i])`
   - `i` is 2
   - `len(l)` must be greater than 1
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(l)`.
4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(l)` must still be greater than 1.

Given these points, we can now update the state for the next iteration of the loop.

**State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]) * l[i] // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[i])`, `i` is 3, `len(l)` must be greater than 1**
