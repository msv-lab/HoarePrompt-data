Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `a-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `s` is 0
   - `j` is equal to the length of `b`
   - The loop breaks if any '*' character is encountered.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < a`. Since the loop has not yet broken due to encountering a '*', the loop will continue if `i < a-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `s` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.
   - `j` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.
   - The condition for breaking the loop (encountering a '*') does not change based on the loop itself but rather on the loop body.

Since no changes are made to `s` or `j` in the loop head, and the loop will continue as long as `i < a-1`, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `i` will be `j` (length of `b`) if it was `j-1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `s` remains 0.
- `j` remains the length of `b`.
- The loop will break if any '*' character is encountered.

Given that `j` is the length of `b` and `i` was `j-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `j`.

State: **`s` is 0, `j` is the length of `b`, `i` is the length of `b`**
