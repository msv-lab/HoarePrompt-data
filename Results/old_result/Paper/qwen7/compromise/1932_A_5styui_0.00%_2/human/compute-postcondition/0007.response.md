Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, and the current value of `b[j]` is '@'**

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
