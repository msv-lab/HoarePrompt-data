Postcondition: `j` is 2, `b` is a non-empty string, and if the character at index 0 of `b` is either '@' or '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index 3 of `b` is '*', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index 0 of `b` is not '@' or '*' or the character at index 3 of `b` is not '*', no change occurs to `j` or `b`.
