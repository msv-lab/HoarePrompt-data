Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 2 if the character at index `j+1` of `b` is `@`, otherwise `s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j+1` of `b` is either `@` or `*` followed by another `*`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` was originally set to 1 if the character at index `j+1` of `b` is `@`, otherwise it is 0. After executing `s = s + 1`, `s` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `s` is now 2 if the character at index `j+1` of `b` is `@`, and remains 1 if the character at index `j+1` of `b` is `*` followed by another `*`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
