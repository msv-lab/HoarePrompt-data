Output State: **`s` is 0, `j` is len(b) - 1, `i` is the length of `b`, the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', the current value of `b` is non-empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
