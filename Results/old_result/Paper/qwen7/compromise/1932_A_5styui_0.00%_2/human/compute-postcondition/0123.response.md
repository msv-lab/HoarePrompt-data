Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index `j` in the range `len(b)`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is 1 if the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0.
   - `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains `len(b) - 1`.
   - `i` is the length of `b`.
   - `b` is an input string.
   - `d` is an input integer.
   - The character at index `j` in `b` is either '*' or '@'.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs based on the index `j`, we need to determine the new value of `j` for the next iteration.
   - If the character at index `j` is '*', then `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - If the character at index `j` is '@', then `j` will remain `len(b) - 1`.

Given the postcondition and the behavior of the loop, let's consider the two possible scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: If the character at index `j` is '*':
  - `j` will be incremented by 1.
  - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

- **Scenario 2**: If the character at index `j` is '@':
  - `j` will remain `len(b) - 1`.
  - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `len(b) - 1`.

Since we don't know the exact character at index `j` from the previous iteration, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the loop will continue as long as `j < len(b)`.

Given that the loop condition is `j < len(b)`, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than the length of `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, and `j` is incremented by 1, while `i` is the length of `b`, `b` is an input string, `d` is an input integer, and the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is either '*' or '@'**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

**State: **`s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, and `j` is incremented by 1, while `i` is the length of `b`, `b` is an input string, `d` is an input integer, and the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is either '*' or '@'**.

To simplify, we can write it as:

**State: **`s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, and `j` is incremented by 1, while `i` is the length of `b`, `b` is an input string, `d` is an input integer, and the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is either '*' or '@'**.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, and `j` is incremented by 1, while `i` is the length of `b`, `b` is an input string, `d` is an input integer, and the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is either '*' or '@'**.
