Postcondition: `j` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index 0 of `b` is either '@' or '*' (or neither, but the conditions remain unchanged). If the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is not '*', the conditions remain unchanged.
