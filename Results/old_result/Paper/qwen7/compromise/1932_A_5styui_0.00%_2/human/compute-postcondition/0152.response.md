Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data for t test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', then returns a specific value based on the input conditions.**

- The function processes t test cases, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
- For each test case, it accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of length n containing '.', '@', and '*'.
- The first character of the string is guaranteed to be '.'.
- The function checks the string for valid moves, ensuring there is at least one valid move from the starting cell.
- Based on the input conditions, the function returns a specific value (though the exact value is not specified in the given information).
