Output State: **`s` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `b`, and the loop breaks if any '*' character is encountered.**

Explanation: The code `s = 0` initializes the variable `s` to 0. This does not affect the values of `j` or the loop conditions. Therefore, `j` remains equal to the length of `b`, and the loop continues to increment `s` for each `@` character found in `b` and breaks if any `*` character is encountered.
