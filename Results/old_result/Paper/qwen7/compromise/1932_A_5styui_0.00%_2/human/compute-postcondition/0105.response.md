Output State: **`s` is 1, `j` is len(b) - 1, `i` is the length of `b`, `b` is an input string, `d` is an input integer, and the current value of b[j] is '@'**.

The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Initially, `s` is 0, so after executing the code, `s` becomes 1. The values of `j`, `i`, `b`, and `d` remain unchanged. The current value of `b[j]` is still '@'.
