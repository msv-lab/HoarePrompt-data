Postcondition: `j` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j` of `b` is either '*', or the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', and `b[:]` is False.
