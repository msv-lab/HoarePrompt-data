Output State: **`balance` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `balance` is initialized to 0. Since the initial state of `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the number of opening parentheses "(" is equal to the number of closing parentheses ")". The code does not alter the value of `balance`, so it remains 0.
