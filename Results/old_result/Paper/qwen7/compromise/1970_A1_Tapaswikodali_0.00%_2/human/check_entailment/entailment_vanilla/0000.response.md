### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` using `input()`.
2. **Balance Calculation and Details Collection**:
   - It iterates through each character of the input string.
   - For each character, it updates the balance and appends a tuple containing the balance, negative position (to ensure correct sorting), and the character to the `details` list.
3. **Sorting**:
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance (in ascending order) and position (in descending order).
   - This ensures that the sequence is shuffled according to the specified rules.
4. **Result Construction**:
   - The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.
   - The negative position is used to break ties in the correct order during sorting.
5. **Output**:
   - The final result is printed as required.

Given the problem statement and the implementation, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.
