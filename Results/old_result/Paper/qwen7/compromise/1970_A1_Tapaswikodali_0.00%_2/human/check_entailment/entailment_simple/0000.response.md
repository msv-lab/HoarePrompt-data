Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the `balance` variable to 0 and an empty list `details`.
2. It iterates through each character in the string `s`, updating the balance and appending a tuple to `details` containing the current balance, the negative index (to ensure the correct sorting order when balances are equal), and the character itself.
3. After collecting all necessary data, it sorts `details` based on the balance values (in ascending order) and, in case of ties, by the negative indices (in descending order).
4. Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list and prints it.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` aligns with the definition of the balanced shuffle operation. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for any valid input as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
