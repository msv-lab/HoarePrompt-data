Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - It then sets each element of `nums` to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1.
   - This step ensures that each element contributes the maximum possible number of 1s in the binary representation.
   - After setting all elements to this value, it subtracts this value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element to ensure the total sum equals `k`.

3. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR**:
   - Each element `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is a number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1.
   - The bitwise OR of such numbers will maximize the number of 1s in the resulting binary representation because each bit position will be set to 1 at least once.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k` is fully consumed by setting the last element to `k`.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The annotated program correctly processes each test case and prints the results in the required format.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` and the overall program logic correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
