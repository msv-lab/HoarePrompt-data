Output State: **`t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and the last element of `nums` is now `2*k-1` and `k` is reduced to 0.**

Explanation: In the given code, `nums[-1] += k` increments the last element of the list `nums` by the value of `k`. Since `nums` is initially a list of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, the last element before the operation is `k-1`. After the operation, the last element becomes `(k-1) + k = 2*k-1`. The value of `k` itself is reduced to 0 after this operation. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
