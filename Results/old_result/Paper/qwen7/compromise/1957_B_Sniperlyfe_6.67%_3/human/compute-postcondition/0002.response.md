Output State: `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is 2^k.bit_length() - 1, and `k` is reduced by 2^k.bit_length() - 1 for each iteration.
