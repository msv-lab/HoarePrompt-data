Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and `index` (which is implicitly used here as `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`).

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i`: This variable starts at `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - `n`: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Check the given state**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
   - `nums` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `0` and `n` determines the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `0` for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` itself does not need to be adjusted because it starts at `0` and will be incremented within the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
