Output State: **`i` is 10, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 479, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10, 10], `mx` is updated to be the maximum of `mx` and `i`.**

Since `i` is 10 and `mx` is also 10, the `max(mx, i)` function will not change the value of `mx`. Therefore, `mx` remains 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
