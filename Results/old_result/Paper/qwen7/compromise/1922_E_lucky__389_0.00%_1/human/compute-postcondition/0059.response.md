Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `len(subseq_lens)`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):` will start when `i` is 1 and continue as long as `i` is less than `len(subseq_lens)`. 

4. **Check the initial value of `len(subseq_lens)`**: The list `subseq_lens` is given as `[10, 10]`, so `len(subseq_lens)` is 2.

5. **Determine the condition for the loop to start**: For the loop to start, `i` must be 1 (since the loop starts at 1 and increments by 1). Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1.

6. **Adjust other states if necessary**: The other states (`mx`, `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `ansv`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1 and `len(subseq_lens)` to 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `len(subseq_lens)` is 2**
