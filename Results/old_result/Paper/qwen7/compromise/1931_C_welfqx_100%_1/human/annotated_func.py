#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: All iterations completed. The final output will be based on the last value of `n` provided as input, and the values of `cn` and `ck` calculated during the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if consecutive elements in the list are identical. If not, it calculates the length of the longest sequence of identical elements from both the original and reversed lists, then prints the difference between the length of the list and the maximum of these two lengths. If the list has only one element or all elements are identical, it prints 0.
