Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic implemented in the function `func()` does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using the allowed operation.

Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Identifying Segments**: The code attempts to identify segments where elements are the same but does not handle the general case where the array needs to be made uniform by a single operation.
2. **Reverse Array Handling**: The reverse array handling is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation part is flawed. The logic to find the minimum cost should involve identifying the longest segment of identical elements and calculating the cost based on the optimal operation.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
- Identify the minimum cost to make all elements equal by finding the optimal segment to apply the operation.
- The optimal strategy involves finding the minimum cost to make all elements equal, which can be achieved by finding the longest segment of identical elements and applying the operation to the rest of the array.

A more correct approach would involve:
- Identifying the unique values in the array.
- For each unique value, finding the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that value.

This would require a different algorithmic approach to correctly compute the minimum cost.
