You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation where the cost of the operation is the length of the subarray being modified.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Checking if All Elements are Equal:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same.
   - If they are, it prints `0` because no operation is needed.

3. **Finding the Longest Subarray with the Same Element:**
   - The program tries to find the longest subarray starting from the beginning and the end of the array where the elements are the same.
   - `cn` finds the length of the longest prefix where elements are the same.
   - `ck` finds the length of the longest suffix where elements are the same.
   - If the first element of the array (`symb1`) is the same as the last element of the reversed array (`symb2`), it adds `ck` to `cn`.

4. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The cost is calculated as `n - max(cn, ck)`, which means the cost is the total length minus the length of the longest subarray where elements are the same.

### Edge Cases and Examples
- **All Elements are Equal:** If all elements are the same, the program correctly outputs `0`.
- **Single Element Array:** If there is only one element, the program also correctly outputs `0`.
- **Longest Subarray Check:** The program correctly identifies the longest subarray where elements are the same and calculates the cost correctly.
- **Mixed Array:** For arrays with mixed values, the program should identify the longest contiguous segment of the same value and calculate the cost accordingly.

### Test Cases
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The longest subarray with the same value is `[1]` at both ends, so the cost is `6 - 2 = 4`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: All elements are the same, so no operation is needed.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The longest subarray with the same value is `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`, so the cost is `8 - 5 = 3`. However, the program correctly identifies the longest subarray and outputs `2`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `[1]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Single element, so no operation is needed.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `[1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The longest subarray with the same value is `[1]`, so the cost is `2 - 1 = 1`.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The longest subarray with the same value is `[1]`, so the cost is `3 - 1 = 2`.

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Explanation: The longest subarray with the same value is `[1, 1]`, so the cost is `7 - 2 = 5`.

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `7`
   - Explanation: The longest subarray with the same value is `[5, 5, 5]`, so the cost is `9 - 3 = 6`.

After verifying the program with the provided test cases, the program appears to be correct and handles all edge cases appropriately.
