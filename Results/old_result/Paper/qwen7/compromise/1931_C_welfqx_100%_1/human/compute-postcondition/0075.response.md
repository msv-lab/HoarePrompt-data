To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ii` is `n-2`: This means `ii` is the value of `n` minus 2.
   - `ck` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `onum`: This implies that `ck` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the list `onum`.
   - `cn` is increased by `ck`: This means `cn` starts with 0 and is incremented by the value of `ck`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(n - max(cn, ck))
   ```

Given the above information, let's analyze the expression inside the `print` statement:

- `max(cn, ck)` will return the maximum value between `cn` and `ck`.
- The expression `n - max(cn, ck)` will subtract this maximum value from `n`.

Since `cn` is initially set to 0 and is incremented by `ck`, the value of `cn` will be `ck` after the increment.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
- If `ck` is greater than or equal to `cn`, then `max(cn, ck)` will be `ck`.
- So, the expression becomes `n - ck`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **n - ck**
