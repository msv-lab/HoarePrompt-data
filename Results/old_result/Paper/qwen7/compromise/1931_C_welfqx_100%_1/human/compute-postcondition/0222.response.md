Postcondition: **`ii` is 5, `ck` is 3 or 2, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`. If `onum[ii]` equals `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is set to 3. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
