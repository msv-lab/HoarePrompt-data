Output State: **`ii` is 3, `n` is 4, and `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ii`, `n`, or `onum`. It only causes the loop or conditional block it is inside to terminate. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the condition involving `onum[ii]` and `onum[ii + 1]` also remains the same.
