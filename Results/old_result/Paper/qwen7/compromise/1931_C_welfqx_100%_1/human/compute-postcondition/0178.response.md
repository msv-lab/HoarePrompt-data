Postcondition: **`ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `num`, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 0, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `num` such that no two consecutive elements are different. If any two consecutive elements were different during the iteration, the loop would have broken and `f` would be set to 0 before the end of the loop. The condition `n == 1 or f == 1` is true.**
