The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is a list of integers.
- `cn` is increased by 1 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.
- If they are not equal, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration.
- `n` is the length of the list `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration. Then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent it as `i + 1`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers, `cn` is increased by 1 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, if they are not equal, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the length of the list `num`**
