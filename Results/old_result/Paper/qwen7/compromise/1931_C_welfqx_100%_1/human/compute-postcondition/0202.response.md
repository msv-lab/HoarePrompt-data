Postcondition: `ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then we continue without breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
