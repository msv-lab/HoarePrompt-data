Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `ii`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive). Therefore, the only variable that changes within this loop is `ii`.

2. **Determine the Range of `ii`**: Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, the initial value of `ii` is `0` and it increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `n-2`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is `5`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be incremented by `1`. Therefore, `ii` should be `6` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`ck`, `cn`, `r`, `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition. Hence, they remain the same as the end of the previous iteration.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`ii` is 6, `ck` is 3 or 2, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`**
