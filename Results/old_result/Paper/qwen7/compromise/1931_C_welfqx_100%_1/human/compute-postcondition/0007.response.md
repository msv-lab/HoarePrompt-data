Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, and the current value of `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`**.

The value of `f` is explicitly set to 0, changing its previous value of 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions or constraints.
