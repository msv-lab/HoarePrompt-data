You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for r in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        f = 1
        
        num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
        
        for j in range(n - 1):
            if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
                f = 0
                break
        
        if n == 1 or f == 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        onum = num.copy()
        
        onum.reverse()
        
        cn = 1
        
        ck = 1
        
        f = 1
        
        symb1 = num[0]
        
        symb2 = onum[0]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
                cn += 1
            else:
                break
        
        for ii in range(n - 1):
            if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
                ck += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if symb1 == symb2:
            cn += ck
        
        print(n - max(cn, ck))
        
    #State: All iterations completed. The final output will be based on the last value of `n` provided as input, and the values of `cn` and `ck` calculated during the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the given test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
