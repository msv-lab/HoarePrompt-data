Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `cn` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since the condition for breaking out of the loop is `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, the values of the other variables (`num`, `cn`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these variables with their original values and mentions that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
