Output State: `ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is equal to `n`.

In the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`. This is because the loop runs from `i` in the range `n-1`, meaning it will iterate until `i` reaches `n-1`. Since `i` starts from 0, it will incrementally reach `n-1`, making `i` finally equal to `n` when the loop terminates. The values of other variables such as `ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, and `symb2` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
