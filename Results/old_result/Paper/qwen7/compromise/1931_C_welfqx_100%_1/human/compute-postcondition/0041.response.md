Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the condition `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `range(n - 1)` implies that the loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0 and `n` is at least 2, the loop can still execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be at least 2.
   - The postcondition about `num[i]` and `num[i + 1]` does not change because it is an internal condition within the loop body, not a loop head variable.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` becomes 1.
- `n` remains at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**.
