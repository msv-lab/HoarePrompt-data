Output State: `ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 1`. This is because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive), so the last iteration sets `i` to `n - 2`. However, since the loop condition checks `range(n - 1)`, the final value of `i` will be `n - 1`. The values of `ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, and `symb2` remain unchanged as the loop does not modify these variables.
