Output State: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is a list which is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `n` must be at least 2, and the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Since `cn` was initially 1, after executing this line, `cn` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
