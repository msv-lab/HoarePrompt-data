Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `i` is 3, `cn` is 2, `n` is 4, and no further comparisons are made since `i` has reached the length of `num` minus one.**

Explanation: Given the loop runs from `i` in `range(n - 1)`, and considering the output state after 3 iterations indicates `i` is 2 and `cn` is 2 with `n` being 4, it means the loop will run until `i` reaches 3 (since `range(4)` will iterate over 0, 1, 2, 3). After the loop completes, `i` will be 3, `cn` will still be 2 (as no further increments occurred), and `n` will remain 4 (the length of `num`). No further comparisons are made as `i` has reached the end of the range.
