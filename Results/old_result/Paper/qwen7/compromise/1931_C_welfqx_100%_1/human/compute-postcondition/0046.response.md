Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.

5. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2, the condition becomes `2 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `n > 3`.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2**
