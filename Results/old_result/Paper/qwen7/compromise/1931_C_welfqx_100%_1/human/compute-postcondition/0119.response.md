Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `cn` is increased by 1 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, if they are not equal, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the length of the list `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables outside the scope of the loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `num`, `cn`, `i`, `n`, and the conditions related to these variables remain unchanged, except that the loop or if statement is exited.
