Output State: **ii is 4, n is 4, and ck is either 0 or 1.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ii` will be equal to `n - 1`, which is 3 in this case but since the loop increments `ii` up to `n - 1`, `ii` will be 4. The variable `n` remains unchanged at 4. The variable `ck` will be 1 if `onum[3]` (or `onum[4]` as `ii` reaches the end) is equal to `onum[4]` (or `onum[5]`), and 0 otherwise, because the loop breaks out of the condition where they are not equal.
