Output State: **`ck` is 2, `ii` is 4, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the value of `onum[ii + 1]**.

Explanation: The variable `ck` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
