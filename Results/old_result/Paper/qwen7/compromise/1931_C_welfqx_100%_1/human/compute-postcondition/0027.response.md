Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a copy of the list `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum = num.copy()` creates a copy of the list `num` and assigns it to the variable `onum`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `r`, `f`, `n`, `j`, and `num`) remain unchanged.
