Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum.reverse()` reverses the list `onum` in-place. This means that `onum` now contains the elements of the original list `num` in reverse order. The values of other variables (`t`, `r`, `f`, `n`, `num`, `j`) remain unchanged.
