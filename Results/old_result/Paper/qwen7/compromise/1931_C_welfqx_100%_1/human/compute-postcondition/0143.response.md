Output State: **`ii` is 4, `n` is 4, `ck` is 1**

The variable `ck` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not given but implied to be 0 since no initial value is mentioned). Given that `ii` and `n` remain unchanged, their values stay as 4. Therefore, `ck` becomes 1 after the increment.
