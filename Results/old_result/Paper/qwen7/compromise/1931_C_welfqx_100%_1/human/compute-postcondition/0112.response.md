Output State: **`num` is a list of integers; `cn` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cn` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `cn` before the increment is not given. The list `num` remains unchanged from its initial state, with the condition that `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.
