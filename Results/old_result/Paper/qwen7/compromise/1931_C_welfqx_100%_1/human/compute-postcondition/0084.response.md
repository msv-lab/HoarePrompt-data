Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and either the element at index `j` in `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` in `num`, in which case `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or there is no other condition to check as the else part does not change the state.
