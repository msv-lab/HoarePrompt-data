Output State: **`input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `t` and `array` remain unchanged. The variable `n` remains unchanged as well, since its value is determined by the length of the `array` and not by the input operation. Therefore, the only new variable introduced is `data`, which contains the split input.
