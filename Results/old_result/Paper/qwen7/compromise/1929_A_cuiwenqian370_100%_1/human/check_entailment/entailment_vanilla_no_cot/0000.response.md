Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the beauty of the array by sorting it and then calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, the problem requires finding the maximum possible beauty by rearranging the elements of the array, not just sorting them.

To solve this problem correctly, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. Given that the beauty is calculated as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`, the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array such that the largest element is at the beginning and the smallest is at the end, with the rest of the elements in between in any order.

Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        array = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))
        # Sort the array to easily find the max and min values
        array.sort()
        # Calculate the maximum beauty
        beauty = array[-1] - array[0] - (sum(array[1:-1]) - array[0] - array[-1])
        results.append(beauty)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This approach sorts the array and then calculates the maximum beauty by considering the difference between the largest and smallest elements minus the sum of the middle elements. This ensures that the beauty is maximized by leveraging the full range of the array's values.
