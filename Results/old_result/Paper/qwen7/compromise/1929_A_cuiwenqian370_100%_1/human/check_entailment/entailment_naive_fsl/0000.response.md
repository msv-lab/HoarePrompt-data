Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, this approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty for all possible rearrangements of the array.

For example, consider the input array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. The given solution sorts the array to `[54, 80, 90, 100, 43]` and calculates the beauty as `(80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) + (43-100) = 26 + 10 + 10 - 57 = -5` which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve rearranging the array such that the largest elements are placed next to the smallest elements to maximize the positive contributions and minimize the negative contributions. For instance, for the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the optimal arrangement could be `[43, 90, 54, 80, 100]` which gives a beauty of `(90-43) + (54-90) + (80-54) + (100-80) = 47 - 36 + 26 + 20 = 57`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence the correctness is **False**.
