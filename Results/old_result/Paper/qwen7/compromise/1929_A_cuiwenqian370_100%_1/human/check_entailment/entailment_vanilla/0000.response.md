### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty can be maximized by sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting ensures that the differences are minimized between smaller and larger elements, thus maximizing the overall sum of differences.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a stream and processing each one separately.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the first test case: `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`. The beauty is `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`.
   - For the second test case: `[69, 69, 69]`, the beauty is `0` since all elements are the same.
   - For the third test case: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The beauty is `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57`.
   - For the fourth test case: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, sorting gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. The beauty is `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.
   - For the fifth test case: `[2, 1]`, sorting gives `[1, 2]`. The beauty is `(2-1) = 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
