Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports.
   - It initializes the first `d-1` elements of the row by adding 1 to their current values.
   - For the remaining elements, it calculates the cost as the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus 1, ensuring the distance condition is met.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the processed row, which represents the total cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the entire problem.
   - It reads the dimensions of the river (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depth of each cell in each row from the input.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost for installing supports in that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing up the costs of the rows in each set.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.
   - It handles the edge cases where the row length is less than `d` by setting the initial values appropriately.
   - The final cost calculation is correct and follows the problem constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each row using `func_1`.
   - The summation of costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows is done accurately.
   - The overall logic for finding the minimum total cost is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion

**Correctness: True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided functions accurately solve the problem as intended.
