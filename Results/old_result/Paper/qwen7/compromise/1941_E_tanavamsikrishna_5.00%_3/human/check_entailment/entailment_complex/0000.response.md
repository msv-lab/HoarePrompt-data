Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: 
   - The function `func_1` processes a single row of river depths and ensures that the cost of installing supports meets the specified conditions.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1.
   - For each subsequent element, it sets the value to the minimum of the previous `d+1` elements plus its original value plus 1.
   - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for that row under the given constraints.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes the entire grid of river depths.
   - It iterates over each row, calculating the cost of installing supports for that row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of the selected rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The main function correctly initializes the necessary inputs and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - `func_2` correctly processes the input data and computes the required output.
   - The logic for processing each row and finding the minimum cost for building `k` bridges is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

Correctness: **True**
