### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building \(k\) bridges over \(k\) consecutive rows in a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the start and end of the row.
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a single row to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports.
   - It ensures that the first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1.
   - For each subsequent element, it sets the value to the minimum of the previous `d+1` elements plus 1.
   - This function correctly computes the minimum cost for a single row under the given constraints.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire grid to find the optimal placement of \(k\) bridges.
   - It iterates through each possible starting row for the bridges.
   - For each starting row, it calculates the total cost of placing supports for \(k\) consecutive rows.
   - It then finds the minimum total cost among all possible placements.
   - The logic and implementation of this function align with the problem statement and correctly uses `func_1` to compute the cost for each row.

4. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The main loop in `func_2` correctly handles the input and output as specified.
   - It processes each test case independently and computes the required output.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
