Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river.
   - It ensures that the cost of installing supports in the row meets the constraints.
   - The function calculates the cost of supports for each cell in the row, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the entire problem.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the river grid (`rows`) from the input.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to calculate the cost of installing supports.
   - It then finds the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **`func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function correctly initializes the first `d-1` cells with their depths plus 1.
   - For the remaining cells, it ensures that the cost of installing a support is the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus 1.
   - This approach ensures that the distance constraint is met.

2. **`func_2` Implementation**:
   - The function correctly reads the input values and the river grid.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as the first and last columns having a depth of 0.
   - The function correctly handles the distance constraint for supports.

2. **Algorithm Validity**:
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the cost for each row using dynamic programming.
   - The algorithm correctly finds the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

3. **Input Validation**:
   - The function assumes valid inputs as per the problem description (e.g., `n`, `m`, `k`, `d` are within specified bounds).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the functions and their implementations, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
