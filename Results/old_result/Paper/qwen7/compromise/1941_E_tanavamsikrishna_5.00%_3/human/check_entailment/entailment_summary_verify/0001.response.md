### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to build \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
- Each bridge must have supports installed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than \( d \).
- The cost of installing a support in cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).
- The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports.

#### Function Summaries Recap
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Processes a single row to ensure the cost of installing supports meets the constraints.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and finds the minimum total cost for building \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **`func_1` Implementation**:
   - Initializes the first \( d-1 \) cells with their depths plus 1.
   - For the remaining cells, it ensures the cost of installing a support is the minimum cost of the previous \( d \) cells plus 1.
   - This ensures the distance constraint is met.

2. **`func_2` Implementation**:
   - Reads the input values for \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \).
   - Reads the river grid (`rows`).
   - Applies `func_1` to each row to calculate the cost of supports.
   - Finds the minimum total cost for building \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows.

#### Edge Cases and Algorithm Validity
- The function handles edge cases where the first and last columns have a depth of 0.
- The function correctly uses dynamic programming to ensure the distance constraint is met for each row.
- The function iterates through all possible sets of \( k \) consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

#### Input Validation
- The function assumes valid inputs as per the problem description.

#### Correctness Verification
- The algorithm correctly calculates the cost for each row using dynamic programming.
- The algorithm correctly finds the minimum total cost for building \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows.
- The function handles all specified constraints and edge cases.

### Conclusion
After re-evaluating the functions and their implementations, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
