Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**: The function constructs a binary representation of `x` using 30 bits. This is done by checking if each bit position (from 0 to 29) is set in `x` and appending '1' or '0' accordingly. This part is correct and ensures that the initial binary representation is correct.

3. **Modification Rules**:
   - The function then iterates over the binary representation and applies the following rules:
     - If two consecutive '1's are found, it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets a flag to indicate that a modification was made.
     - If the flag is set and the current bit is '0', it changes the current bit to '1'.
     - If the flag is set and the previous bit is '1', it changes the current bit to '0'.
   - These rules ensure that no two consecutive non-zero bits exist in the final representation.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If the last bit is '0' and the flag is set, it changes the last bit to '1'.
   - If the flag is set but the last bit is '0', it appends a '1' at the end and increases the length by 1.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the length of the modified binary representation.
   - It also prints the modified binary representation, ensuring that the constraints are met.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function correctly implements the required logic and adheres to the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
