Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `nalla`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 28` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `flag` is 1
   - `i` is between 0 and 28 (inclusive)
   - `length` is 30
   - `s` is a list of 30 elements
   - `nalla` is 31

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 28`, if `i` was 28 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 29.
   - However, the loop condition is `range(0, 29)`, which means `i` should be less than 29 for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than 29 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `flag` remains 1 as it does not change within the loop.
   - `i` must be less than 29.
   - `length` remains 30.
   - `s` remains a list of 30 elements.
   - `nalla` remains 31.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`flag` is 1, `i` is less than 29, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements, `nalla` is 31**
