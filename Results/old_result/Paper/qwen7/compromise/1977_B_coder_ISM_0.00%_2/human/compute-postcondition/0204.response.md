Output State: **`i` is 3; `length` must be greater than 2; `s` is unchanged except for the element at index 2 which is now '-1'**

Explanation: The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` changes the element at index `i - 1` in the string `s`. Given that `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2. So, the element at index 2 of `s` is changed from `'0'` to `'-1'`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
