Output State: **`i` is 29, `n` is 29, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[i]` is '1', and `s[i + 1]` is either '0' or '1' based on the value of `flag`.**

The code `s[i] = '1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from its original value (which was either '0' or '1') to '1'. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
