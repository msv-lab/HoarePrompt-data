Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to 30.
   - `length` is set to 31.
   - `s[29]` is '1'.
   - `s[30]` is '1'.
   - `s[31]` is '1'.
   - The rest of the elements in `s` remain unchanged.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*s)` statement unpacks the list `s` and prints its elements separated by spaces.

3. **Value of `s`**:
   - Since `s[29]`, `s[30]`, and `s[31]` are explicitly given, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, we need to consider the initial state of `s` before these changes.
   - Given that `length` is 31, the list `s` must have 32 elements (from `s[0]` to `s[31]`).

4. **Unchanged Elements**:
   - The elements from `s[0]` to `s[28]` are not specified, so they remain in their original state.
   - The elements from `s[29]` to `s[31]` are explicitly given as '1'.

5. **Output**:
   - When the `print(*s)` statement is executed, it will print all elements of `s` separated by spaces.
   - The output will include the unspecified elements from `s[0]` to `s[28]`, followed by '1', '1', and '1'.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **[elements from s[0] to s[28]], 1, 1, 1**
