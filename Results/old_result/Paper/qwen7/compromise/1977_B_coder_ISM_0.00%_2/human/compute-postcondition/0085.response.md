Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 28.
   - `length` is derived from the condition given in the problem.

3. **Analyze the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `i` is less than `length`.
   - Given that `i` is 28, the loop will execute as long as `length` is greater than 28.

4. **Determine the value of `length`**:
   - If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[30]` is '1' and the length of `s` becomes 1.
   - Otherwise, the length of `s` remains unchanged.

5. **Evaluate the possible values of `length`**:
   - If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` would be 1.
   - If `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is '1', then `length` would be 30 (since the string `s` has indices from 0 to 29).

6. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is 28, the loop will execute if `length` is greater than 28.
   - Therefore, `length` must be greater than 28 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `length`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 28, `length` must be greater than 28**
