Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `i` is less than `length`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 30
   - `s[29]` is '-1'
   - `length` must be greater than 1

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `length`. Given that `i` is currently 30, `length` must be greater than 30 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 31.
   - `length` must remain greater than 30.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 31
   - `s[29]` remains '-1'
   - `length` must be greater than 30

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 31, `s[29]` is '-1', and `length` must be greater than 30**
