Output State: **`i` is 29, `n` is 29, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[i]` is '0', `s[i + 1]` is not '0' if `flag` is 1, otherwise `s[i + 1]` is '0' if `flag` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of `s[i]` to '0'. Based on the initial conditions, if `flag` is 1, then `s[i + 1]` must remain not equal to '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `s[i + 1]` must also be '0'. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `flag`) remain unchanged.
