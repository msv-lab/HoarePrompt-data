Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 0 (or any value between 0 and 28), `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements where `s[i]` is now '-1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`, and `nalla` is 31.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` still holds true since only `s[i]` was modified.
