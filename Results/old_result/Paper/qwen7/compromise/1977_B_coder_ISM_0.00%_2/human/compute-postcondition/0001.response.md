State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `nalla`, which is being initialized by the `range(t)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Given the constraint `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `t` must be within this range.
4. The variable `nalla` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(t)` starts counting from 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must satisfy the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and `nalla` should be set to 0.
