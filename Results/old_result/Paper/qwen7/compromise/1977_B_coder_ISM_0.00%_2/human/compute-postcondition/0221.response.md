Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is an integer.
- `i` is an integer.
- The postcondition is that if `x` is greater than or equal to \(2^i\) and the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^i\) is non-zero, then `s` is a list containing '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing '0'.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(30):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 30.

3. **Update the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its value at the start of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will now be one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Updated State:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was previously `i_end`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.
- The value of `x` and the condition for `s` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is an integer + 1, and the postcondition regarding `s` remains the same.**

In a more specific form:
State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is an integer and `i` must be less than 30, and the postcondition regarding `s` remains the same.**
