Output State: **`i` is 31, `s[29]` is '-1', `s[31]` is '0', `s[30]` is '-1'**

Explanation: The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i - 1` in the list `s`. Given that `i` is 31, `i - 1` is 30. Therefore, `s[30]` is updated to '-1'. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
