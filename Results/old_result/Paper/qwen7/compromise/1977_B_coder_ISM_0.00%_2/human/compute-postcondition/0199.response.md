Output State: **`i` is 2; `length` must be greater than 1; the element at index 1 of `s` is '-1'**

Explanation: The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i - 1` of the list `s`. Given that `i` is 2, `i - 1` equals 1. Therefore, the element at index 1 of `s` is set to '-1'. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
