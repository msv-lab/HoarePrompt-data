Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `curr` will be updated to the sum of all elements in `nums` that are not zero, starting from the second element. `n` remains an input integer, `t` is `t - len(nums)`, and `last` is the last element of the original `nums`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all iterations, `curr` accumulates the difference between each non-zero element in `nums` and the `last` value, which starts as the last element of the original `nums` and updates with each iteration to the last processed element. The loop processes each element of `nums` exactly once, so `last` ends up being the last element of the original `nums` list. The variable `t` decreases by one for each iteration, so after processing all elements, `t` is reduced by the length of `nums`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
