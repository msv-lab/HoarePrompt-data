Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` except those that are 0, each adjusted by subtracting `last` from it, where `last` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration, `t` must be decreased by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `nums`. The initial values of `n`, `curr`, `last`, and `t` remain unchanged, but now `nums` is updated with the new list of integers.
