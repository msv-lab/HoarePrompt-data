Output State: **`curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`, `nums` must contain at least one element, and the index `i` is not 0.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to its current value. The initial conditions for `nums` and `i` remain unchanged.
