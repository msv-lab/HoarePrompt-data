Based on the initial state provided:

- `curr` is updated to 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `t` is `t - len(nums)`, meaning `t` is reduced by the length of the list `nums`.
- `last` is the last element of the original `nums`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' without any reference to the variables `curr`, `n`, `t`, or `last`.

Output: **YES**
