Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the given integers is divisible by n and returns True if so, otherwise returns False.**

This means the function iterates through multiple test cases, each containing a value t and a list of integers. It then verifies if the sum of these integers is divisible by the count of integers (n), returning True if the condition is met for all test cases, and False otherwise.
