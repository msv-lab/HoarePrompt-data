Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in nums:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `i`: This variable takes on the value of each element in the `nums` list during each iteration.
   - `nums`: This is the list being iterated over.

3. **Check the provided initial state**:
   - `curr` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\) (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `last` is the last element of the updated `nums` list (not directly relevant to the loop head but might affect the final state).
   - `nums` is updated with integers from the input split into a list (relevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `nums`, `nums` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will take on the values of the elements in `nums` during each iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `nums` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums` must contain at least one element**
