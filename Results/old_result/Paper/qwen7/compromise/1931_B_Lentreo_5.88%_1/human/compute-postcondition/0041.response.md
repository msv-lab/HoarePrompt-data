Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `nums`.

3. **Analyze the Given Postcondition**:
   - `nums` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element from `nums`.
   - `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value, where `last` is the last value used for updating `curr` before the current iteration.

4. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nums` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element from `nums`.
   - `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element from `nums`, after processing `i`, `nums` will no longer contain `i`.
   - For the loop to continue, `nums` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in `nums`.
   - `curr` will be updated by adding `i - last` to its current value.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `nums` must contain at least one element (excluding the current `i`).
   - `i` will be the next element from `nums`.
   - `curr` will be updated by adding `i - last` to its current value.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nums` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element from `nums`, and `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value**.
