Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `nums`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `curr` is `2 * (i - last)`
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `last` is the last element of the list `nums`
   - `i` is the second element of the list `nums` (if `nums` still has elements)
   - `nums` is the list without its first element

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `nums`, after the current iteration, `i` will be the third element of the updated `nums`.
   - `nums` will be further reduced by removing its first element.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `curr` remains unchanged because it is calculated based on the current `i` and `last`, and these values will be updated in the next iteration.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `last` will be the second-to-last element of the updated `nums` after the current iteration.
   - `i` will be the third element of the updated `nums`.
   - `nums` will be the list without its first two elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`curr` is `2 * (i - last)`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the second-to-last element of the updated `nums`, `i` is the third element of the updated `nums`, `nums` is the list without its first two elements**.
