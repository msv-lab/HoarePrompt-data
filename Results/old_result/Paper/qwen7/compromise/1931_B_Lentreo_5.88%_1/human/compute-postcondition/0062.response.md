Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `nums`, and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`.

3. **Analyze the given postconditions**:
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `last` is the last element of `nums`.
   - `t` is decreased by 1.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - The first element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `t` is decreased by 1, so `t` becomes `t - 1`.
   - `nums` remains the same list of integers.
   - `last` is the last element of `nums`, which does not change until the list changes.
   - `i` will be the next element in `nums` during the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` is now `t - 1`.
   - `nums` remains unchanged.
   - `last` remains the same.
   - `i` will be the next element in `nums`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `t` and the fact that `i` will be the next element in `nums`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`, `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is `t - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and the first element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0.**
