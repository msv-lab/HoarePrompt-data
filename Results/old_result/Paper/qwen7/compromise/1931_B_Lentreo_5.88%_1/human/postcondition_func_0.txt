The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (indicating the number of subsequent test cases) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers whose sum is divisible by \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the non-zero elements in the list, adjusted by subtracting the last element of the list for each non-zero element. If this adjusted sum equals zero, it prints 'YES', indicating the sum is divisible by \( n \); otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
