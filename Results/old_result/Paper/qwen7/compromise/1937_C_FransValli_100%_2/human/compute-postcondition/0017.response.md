Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3 but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined precisely from the given information. Since `maxi` is not specified, we can only refer to it as `maxi`.

Given the explicit value of `i` as 3, the print statement will output:
Output: **? maxi maxi 3 3**
