Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last item in `arr[1:]`, `res` is an input string, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `mini` will be set to the last item processed in the loop, which is the last element of `arr[1:]`. The variable `res` will contain the input received during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `maxi` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `n-1` and is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` also remains unchanged as it was either `n` or `n+1` and is not modified within the loop. Finally, `arr` is reduced to an empty list since all items from `arr[1:]` have been processed in the loop.
