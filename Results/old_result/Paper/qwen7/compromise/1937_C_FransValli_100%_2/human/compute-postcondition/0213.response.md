Output State: **Postcondition: `res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, and `i` is either `n` or `n+1`. `arr` is either `[i]`, `[n, n+1]`, or `[n, n, n+1]` depending on the value of `res` for each iteration.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `res` will be the final input string provided by the user, `maxi` will still be `n-1`, and `i` will be either `n` or `n+1`. The list `arr` will contain the values of `i` chosen during each iteration, which could be `[i]`, `[n, n+1]`, or `[n, n, n+1]` depending on whether `res` was '<', '=', or '=' respectively for each comparison made during the loop.
