Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `mini` is equal to `arr[0]`: This means `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`.
   - `res` is a new input string from the user: This is a string input provided by the user.
   - `maxi` is equal to `n-1`: This means `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is either `n` or `n+1`: This means `i` can be either `n` or `n+1`.
   - `arr` must be one of `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`: This means `arr` can either be a list with two elements where the first is `n` and the second is `n+1`, or a list with three elements where the first two are `n` and the third is `n+1`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`
   - `'?'` is a constant string.
   - `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`.
   - `item` is not defined in the initial state, but it seems to be a placeholder for either `n` or `n+1` since `i` is either `n` or `n+1`.

Given the possible values of `arr` and the definition of `mini`, let's consider both cases for `arr`:

- If `arr` is `[n, n+1]`, then `mini` is `n`.
- If `arr` is `[n, n, n+1]`, then `mini` is also `n`.

In both cases, `mini` is `n`. Since `item` is either `n` or `n+1`, the print statement will include `n` twice.

Therefore, the print statement will output: `? n n n n`.

Output: **? n n n n**
