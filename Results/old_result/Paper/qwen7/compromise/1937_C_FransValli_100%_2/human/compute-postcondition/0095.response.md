Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3 (because `i` is incremented by 1).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` must be greater than 2, it remains unchanged as long as the condition is satisfied.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 2.
   - The other variables (`res` and `maxi`) are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `res` is the input string, and if the current value of `res` is equal to '<', then `maxi` is 2**
