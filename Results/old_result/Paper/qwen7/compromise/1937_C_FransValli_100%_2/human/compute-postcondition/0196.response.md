Output State: **`res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `arr` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[0, i]` depending on whether `res` is `<` or `=`.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` takes a new input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The other variables (`maxi`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
