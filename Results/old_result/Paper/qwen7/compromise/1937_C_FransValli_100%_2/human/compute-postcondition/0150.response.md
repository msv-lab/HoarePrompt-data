Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[2]`, `item` is `arr[3]`, `res` is an input string**

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes user input. The other variables (`mini` and `item`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `mini` is still equal to `arr[2]`, `item` is still `arr[3]`, and `res` is now the string input by the user.
