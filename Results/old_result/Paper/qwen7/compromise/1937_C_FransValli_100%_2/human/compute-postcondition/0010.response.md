Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `res` is an input string (this variable is not part of the loop head).

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (because the loop starts from 1 and increments by default).
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

Since `res` is not part of the loop head, its state does not change for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
