Output State: **`arr` is either `[i+1]` or `[0, i+1, i+1]`, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string from the user, `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the input string from the user to the variable `res`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `maxi` remain unchanged from their initial states.
