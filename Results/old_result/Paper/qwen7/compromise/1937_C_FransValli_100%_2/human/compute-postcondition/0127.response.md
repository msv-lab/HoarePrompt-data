Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, `arr` is `[i + 2]`**

Explanation: The code updates the list `arr` to contain the value of `i + 2`. Since `i` was initially `i + 2`, `arr` now contains the value `i + 2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
