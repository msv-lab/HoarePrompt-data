Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is [0], `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `res` is the last input string received, `maxi` is the maximum value between 0 and any value assigned to it during the loop (which happens when `res` equals '<').
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `res` is an input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` contains the value of `i`. If `res` is not equal to '<' but equals '=', `arr` also contains the value of `i`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, and `arr` contains the value of `i + 1`. This is true regardless of whether `res` is '<' or '='.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, and `arr` contains the value of `i + 2`. If `res` equals `'<'`, then no change occurs. If `res` equals `'='`, then `i` is appended to itself and added to `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
