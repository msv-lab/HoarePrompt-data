Output State: **`arr` is [0, i], `n` is at least `i + 1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `res`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `maxi` remain unchanged from their initial states.
