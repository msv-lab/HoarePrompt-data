Output State: **`res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is a list containing `[i]` appended with `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` was either `[i]` or `[0, i]` depending on the condition. After appending `i`, `arr` now contains `[i]` followed by `i`, making it `[i, i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
