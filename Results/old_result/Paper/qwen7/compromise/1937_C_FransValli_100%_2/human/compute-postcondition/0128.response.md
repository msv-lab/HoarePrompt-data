Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, `arr` contains the value of `i + 2` and then appends `i` to itself.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the value of `i + 2`. After executing the code, `arr` will contain both `i + 2` and `i`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
