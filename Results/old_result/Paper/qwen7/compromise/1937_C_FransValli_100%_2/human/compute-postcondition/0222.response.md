Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for` loop statement `for item in arr[1:]`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**:
   - `item`: This variable is being iterated over from `arr[1:]`.
   - `arr`: This is the list being iterated over.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `mini` is equal to `item`.
   - `res` is the input string with the value `'>'`.
   - `maxi` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `i` is either `n` or `n+1`.
   - `arr` must be one of `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `arr[1:]`, the next value of `item` will be the next element in `arr[1:]`.
   - If `arr` is `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`, the possible values for `item` in the next iteration would be `n+1` if `arr` is `[n, n+1]` or `n+1` if `arr` is `[n, n, n+1]` (since `arr[1:]` starts from the second element).
   - Therefore, `mini` will be updated to `n+1` in the next iteration.
   - `maxi` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `res` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `arr` will be adjusted to reflect the next element being processed, but since we are only asked to update the states based on the loop head, we focus on `item`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `mini` will be updated to `n+1`.
   - `item` will be `n+1` in the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`mini` is equal to `n+1`, `res` is the input string with the value '>', `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `arr` must be one of `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`**.
