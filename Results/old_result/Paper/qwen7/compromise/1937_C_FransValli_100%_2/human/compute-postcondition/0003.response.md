State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` means that `i` will take values from 1 up to but not including `n`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
3. At the start of the loop, `i` is set to 1 as the initial value.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 1) and `i` (it is initialized to 1).
