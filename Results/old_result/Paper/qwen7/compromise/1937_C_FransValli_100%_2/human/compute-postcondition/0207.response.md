Output State: **`res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is `[i]`, and `res` is reassigned to a new input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` updates the list `arr` to contain the single element `i`. All other variables (`res`, `maxi`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Additionally, `res` is reassigned to a new input string from the user, as mentioned in the initial state.
