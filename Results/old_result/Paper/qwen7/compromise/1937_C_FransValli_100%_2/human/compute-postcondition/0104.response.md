Based on the initial state provided, we know that `i` must be less than `n`. However, the values of `maxi` and `arr` are not explicitly defined. Therefore, we need to describe the output in terms of these variables.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

- `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed.
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi` is not specified, so we will leave it as `maxi`.
- `arr[0]`: The value of `arr[0]` is not specified, so we will leave it as `arr[0]`.
- `maxi`: Again, the value of `maxi` is not specified, so we will leave it as `maxi`.
- `i`: The value of `i` is less than `n`, but the exact value is not specified, so we will leave it as `i`.

Given this information, the output will be:

Output: **'? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]**'
