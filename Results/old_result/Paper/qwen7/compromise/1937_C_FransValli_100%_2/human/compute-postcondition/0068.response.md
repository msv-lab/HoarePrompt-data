Output State: **`arr` is `[i+2, i+1]`, `item` is `i+2`, `res` is `input()`, `mini` is `i+2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `item` (which is `i+2`) to the variable `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `arr` remains `[i+2, i+1]`, `item` remains `i+2`, `res` remains `input()`, and `mini` is now `i+2`.
