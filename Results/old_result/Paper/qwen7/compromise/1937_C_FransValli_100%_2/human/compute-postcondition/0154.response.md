Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[n-1]`, `item` is `arr[n-1]`, and `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `arr[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the array and goes up to the last element. After each iteration, if the user inputs '>', the value of `mini` is updated to the current `item`. Since the loop processes each element in the array exactly once, after all iterations, `mini` will be set to the last element of the array, `arr[n-1]`. The variable `item` will also hold the value of `arr[n-1]` at the end of the loop, and `res` remains as an input string because the loop does not modify it.
