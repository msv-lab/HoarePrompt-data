Output State: **`arr` is [0], `n` is equal to the final value of `i`, `maxi` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes the list `arr` with a single element `[0]`. The values of `n` and `maxi` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `n` being the final value of `i` when the loop terminates and `maxi` staying at 0 since no condition `<` was encountered during the loop iterations.
