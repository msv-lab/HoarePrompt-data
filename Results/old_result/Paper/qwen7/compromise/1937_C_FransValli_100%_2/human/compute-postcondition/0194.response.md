Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` is the new input string from the user.
   - `maxi` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `i` must be between `1` and `n-1` inclusive.
   - `arr` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[0, i]` depending on whether `res` is `<` or `=`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, if the current value of `i` is within this range, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from its current value.
   - `maxi` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `res` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `arr` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`res` is the new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `arr` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[0, i]` depending on whether `res` is `<` or `=`.**

Since `i` must be between `1` and `n-1` inclusive, and it is incremented by `1`, the new value of `i` will still be within this range unless it reaches `n`. If `i` reaches `n`, the loop would terminate.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`res` is the new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `arr` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[0, i]` depending on whether `res` is `<` or `=`.**
