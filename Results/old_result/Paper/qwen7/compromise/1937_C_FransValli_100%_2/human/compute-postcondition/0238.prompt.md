You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This is an interactive problem where you need to find two indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized for a given permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). You can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the results of bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in the permutation. After finding the indices, you must print "! i j".
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: Output State: mini is equal to n-1, arr is an empty list, maxi is equal to n-1, and the loop has executed for all iterations of n.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `maxi` will be set to `n-1` because it is updated to the largest index during each iteration. The variable `mini` will also end up being `n-1` as it is updated to the smallest index within the array `arr` in each iteration. By the end of the loop, `arr` will be an empty list because all possible indices have been checked and added to `arr`, then replaced with a new minimum value in subsequent iterations. The loop has processed all iterations of `n`, meaning it has gone through all indices from 1 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but interacts with an external permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). It can make up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in the permutation. After determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \), it prints "! i j" to indicate the result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
