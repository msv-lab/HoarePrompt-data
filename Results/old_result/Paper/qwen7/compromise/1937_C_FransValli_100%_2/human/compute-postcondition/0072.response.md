Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `arr` is defined as `[i+2, i+1]`.
   - `item` is defined as `i+1`.
   - `res` is defined as `input()`. Since `input()` waits for user input, let's denote it as `user_input` for clarity.
   - `mini` is defined as `i+2` if `res` equals `'>'`. Otherwise, the values of `arr`, `item`, `res`, and `mini` remain unchanged.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`.
   - This means the output will start with `'?'` followed by the value of `mini` twice, then the value of `item` twice.

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since `mini` is defined as `i+2` if `res` equals `'>'`, and `res` is `user_input`, the value of `mini` depends on the user input.
   - `item` is `i+1`.

Given the initial state, we need to consider the possible values of `mini` and `item`:
- If `user_input` is `'>'`, then `mini = i+2`.
- If `user_input` is not `'>'`, then `mini` remains `i+2` and `item` remains `i+1`.

Since the exact value of `user_input` is not specified, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **'? [i+2] [i+2] [i+1] [i+1]** (where `[i+2]` is the value of `mini` and `[i+1]` is the value of `item`)
