Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` has been incremented by 1.
   - `n` is the same: The value of `n` remains unchanged from its previous state.
   - `res` is the same: The value of `res` remains unchanged from its previous state.
   - `arr` contains the value of `i + 1` if `res` is '<' or '='; otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged: 
     - If `res` is '<' or '=', then `arr` will contain the value of `i + 1`.
     - If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', then `arr` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`
   - `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed.
   - `maxi`: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. We will leave it as `maxi`.
   - `arr[0]`: Based on the initial state, `arr[0]` will be `i + 1` if `res` is '<' or '='. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - `maxi`: Again, this variable is not defined, so we will leave it as `maxi`.
   - `i`: From the initial state, `i` has been incremented by 1.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output a string with the following components:
- `'?'`
- `maxi` (which is undefined)
- `arr[0]` (which is `i + 1` if `res` is '<' or '=')
- `maxi` (which is undefined)
- `i` (which is `i + 1`)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? maxi i + 1 maxi i + 1'**
