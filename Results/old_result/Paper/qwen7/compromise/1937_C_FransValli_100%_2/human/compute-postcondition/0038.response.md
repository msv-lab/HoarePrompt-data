Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is a list containing `[0, i]`.
- `n` is at least `i + 1`.
- `maxi` is explicitly set to `0`.
- `res` is an input string but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is explicitly set to `0`.
- `arr[0]` is the first element of the list `arr`, which is `0`.
- `maxi` is again explicitly set to `0`.
- `i` is the second element of the list `arr`, which is `i`.

Therefore, the print statement will output these values in the order they appear in the print statement.

Output: **'? 0 0 i '**
