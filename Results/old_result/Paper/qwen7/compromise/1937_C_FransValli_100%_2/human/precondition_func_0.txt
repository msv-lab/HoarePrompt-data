This is an interactive problem where you need to find two indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized for a given permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). You can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the results of bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in the permutation. After finding the indices, you must print "! i j".
