Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.
    #State: `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, and `subseq_lens` is an empty list. The value of `x` is not 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], and `i` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After the first three iterations, we know that `subseq_lens` has been updated with the values 5, 10, and 9, and `mx` has been updated to 10. Since `x` is reduced to 0 after each iteration and the loop condition `x != 0` is no longer satisfied, the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the values [5, 10, 9], `mx` will be 10, and `i` will be 0 as the inner while loop will exit when `2 ** i > x`.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], `i` is 2, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(subseq_lens) - 1`, which means it will run for a total of 2 iterations based on the given `subseq_lens` list (since `len(subseq_lens)` is 3, but the loop starts from 1). After 3 iterations as shown in the provided states, `i` is 2, indicating the loop has completed its execution. Therefore, `ansv` will contain the appended values from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end, which are [5, 5, 9]. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 8
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `i` is 4, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9, 5, 9].
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line
