Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], `i` is 2, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9].

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(subseq_lens) - 1`, which means it will run for a total of 2 iterations based on the given `subseq_lens` list (since `len(subseq_lens)` is 3, but the loop starts from 1). After 3 iterations as shown in the provided states, `i` is 2, indicating the loop has completed its execution. Therefore, `ansv` will contain the appended values from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end, which are [5, 5, 9]. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(ansv)):
    print(ansv[i], end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `ansv` is a list of length 8

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `ansv` is a list of length 8

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `ansv` is a list of length 8




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
