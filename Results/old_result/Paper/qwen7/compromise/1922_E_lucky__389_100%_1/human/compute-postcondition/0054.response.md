Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is 14, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `x`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since no such loop or if statement is mentioned in the code, the values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
