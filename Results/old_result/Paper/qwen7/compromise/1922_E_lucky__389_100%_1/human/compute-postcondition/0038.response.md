Output State: **`i` is 11; `x` is 14; `subseq_lens` contains the value 10**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i - 1` to the list `subseq_lens`. Given that `i` is initially 11, `i - 1` equals 10. Therefore, `subseq_lens` now contains the value 10. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
