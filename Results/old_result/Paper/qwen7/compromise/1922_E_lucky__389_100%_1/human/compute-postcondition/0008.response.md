The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be equal to 0.

Right before the loop, `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\) and `x` is not 2. Therefore, to make the loop execute the first time, `x` must be adjusted to be 0.

State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be 0, and `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
