Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved, which are `i` and `len(ansv)`.

2. **Determine the Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - `ansv` is a list of length 8.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(ansv)`. Since `len(ansv)` is 8, the loop will continue as long as `i < 8`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The condition `i < len(ansv)` (which is 8) must still hold true, so `i` must be less than 8.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 4.
- `ansv` remains a list of length 8.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `ansv` is a list of length 8**
