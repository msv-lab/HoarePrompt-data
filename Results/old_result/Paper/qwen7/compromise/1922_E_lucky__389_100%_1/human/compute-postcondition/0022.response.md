Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 14, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 5, `i` is 6**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^{(i-1)}\). Given that `i` is 6, \(2^{(i-1)} = 2^5 = 32\). So, `x` is updated from its initial value (which is at least 16) to \(x - 32\). Since the initial value of `x` is at least 16, after subtracting 32, `x` becomes 14. All other variables remain unchanged.
