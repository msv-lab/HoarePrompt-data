### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` to the desired state `s2`.
   - Operations include adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s1`, and the desired state `s2`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, s1, s2)` and prints the result.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates two values:
     - `cats_to_add`: The number of cats that need to be added to make the desired state.
     - `cats_to_remove`: The number of cats that need to be removed to achieve the desired state.
   - It returns the maximum of these two values.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - If a box needs a cat but doesn't have one (`s1[i] == '0'` and `s2[i] == '1'`), we need to add a cat.
   - If a box has a cat but shouldn't have one (`s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`), we need to remove a cat.
   - Moving a cat between boxes is considered equivalent to either adding or removing a cat, depending on whether the box ends up with a cat or not.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly counts the number of cats that need to be added and removed.
   - The minimum number of operations will always be the maximum of these two counts because each operation can only change one box at a time.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
