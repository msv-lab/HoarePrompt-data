Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
3. It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.
4. The program sorts the list `M` and determines the number of days `q` to buy tickets based on the ceiling of `k/m`.
5. It then calculates the cost based on the selected days and the conditions provided in the problem statement.
6. The logic for calculating the cost seems to handle both scenarios where the total tickets purchased within the first `q` days equals `k` and when it doesn't.

Given the provided example and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the rules and correctly compute the minimum cost for purchasing `k` tickets across `n` days under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
