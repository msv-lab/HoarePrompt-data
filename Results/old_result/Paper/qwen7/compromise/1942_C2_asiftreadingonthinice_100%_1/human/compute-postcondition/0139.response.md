Output State: **`ans` is incremented by `y` plus `x` minus 2, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` retains its original value, `ii` is `k + 2`, `tt` retains its original value, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is either equal to 2 or even and equals 2 modulo 2.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = []` initializes an empty list for `tmp`. All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
