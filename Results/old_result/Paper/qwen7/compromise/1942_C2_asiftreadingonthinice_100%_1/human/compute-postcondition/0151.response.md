Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(a)` must be at least 1. If the difference between the first element of the list `a` and the second element of the list `a` is equal to 2, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` contains the value of `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.
