Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - The postcondition states that:
     - If the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is 2, then `ans` is 1.
     - If the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2 but is even, then `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.
     - Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(a)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - We need to ensure that the list `a` is still valid for the next iteration. The list `a` should remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, which is not mentioned here.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers**.
