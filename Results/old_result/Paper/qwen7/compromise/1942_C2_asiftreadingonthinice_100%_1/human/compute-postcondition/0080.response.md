Output State: **`i` is 1; `a` is a list of integers where the difference between the first two elements is not equal to 2, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even; `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 1, this translates to appending `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` to `tmp`. The conditions about the list `a` remain unchanged.
