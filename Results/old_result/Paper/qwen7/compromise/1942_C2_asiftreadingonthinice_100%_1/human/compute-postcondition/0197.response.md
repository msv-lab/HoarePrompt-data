Output State: **`tmp` now has one fewer element, `i` is either the first element of the original `tmp` or has been removed, `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `i`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= i - 1` subtracts `i - 1` from `y`. The values of `tmp`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `tmp` still has one fewer element, `i` is either the first element of the original `tmp` or has been removed, and `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `i`. Additionally, `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.
