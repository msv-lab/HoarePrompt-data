Output State: **`tmp` is not empty, and `y` is less than `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `tmp` and `y`, nor does it affect the condition `y < i - 1`. It simply breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the only change is that we break out of the loop or if statement.
