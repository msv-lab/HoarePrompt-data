Output State: **`i` is 4; `tmp` contains an element which is ((a[4] - a[3]) // 2)**

Explanation: The code appends to `tmp` a tuple containing half the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `i` is incremented to 4 during the operation. The value added to `tmp` is calculated as `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
