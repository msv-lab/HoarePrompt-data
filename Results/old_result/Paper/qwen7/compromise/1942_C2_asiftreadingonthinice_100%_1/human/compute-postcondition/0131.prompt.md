Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is sorted, `y` is the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` as many times as possible, `ii` is `k + 1`, `tt` retains its original value, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is either equal to 2 or even and equals 2 modulo 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is sorted, `y` is the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` as many times as possible, `ii` is `k + 1`, `tt` retains its original value, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is either equal to 2 or even and equals 2 modulo 2, and `tmp` must include `len(a)`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `y` is reduced by `i - 1`. Otherwise, `y` remains less than `i - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the first element in `tmp`, `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is sorted, `y` is the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` as many times as possible, `ii` is `k + 1`, `tt` retains its original value, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is either equal to 2 or even and equals 2 modulo 2, `tmp` must include `len(a)`, and `y` is reduced by `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `y` remains less than `i - 1`. If the condition `y >= i - 1` is true, `ans` is incremented by `i + 1`; otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2` (or `i + 1` if `y >= i - 1`), `tmp` is sorted and includes `len(a)`, `y` is recalculated based on the new `i`, `ii` is `k + 1`, `tt` retains its original value, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is either equal to 2 or even and equals 2 modulo 2, and `tmp` must include `len(a)`. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i`; otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2` (or `i + 1` if `y >= i - 1`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
