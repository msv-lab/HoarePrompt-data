Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as the initial state.
