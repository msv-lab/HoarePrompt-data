Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and returns the minimum value between the sum of certain increments derived from the differences between consecutive elements in the list (if these differences are even and equal to 2 modulo 2) plus x, and n - 2. The variable y is used to track and reduce a temporary sum during the calculation process, ensuring it is fully exhausted by the end of the function. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated minimum value for each case.**
