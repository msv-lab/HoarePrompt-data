Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, and `tmp` is a non-empty list containing all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2. Additionally, `y` is either 1 if `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1` and `y` is equal to `i - (i - 1)`, or `y` is less than `i - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
