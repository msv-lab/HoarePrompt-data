To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is the total sum of all elements in `tmp` where `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals 2 modulo 2.
   - `y` is the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from it as many times as possible within each iteration of the loop, or it remains unchanged if the loop breaks early.
   - `ans` is incremented by `y`.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` being even and equal to 2 modulo 2 means that `a[i] - a[i - 1]` must be 2 (since 2 is the only even number that is 2 modulo 2).
   - Therefore, `ans` is the sum of all such differences of 2 between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy the condition.

3. **Final Expression**:
   - After calculating `ans`, the expression `min(ans, n - 2)` is evaluated and printed.

Given the above analysis, the value of `ans` depends on the specific values in `a` and the conditions mentioned. However, without the actual values of `a` and `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. But we know that `ans` is derived from the differences of 2 between consecutive elements in `a` that meet the specified condition.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`.

Output: **min(ans, n - 2)**
