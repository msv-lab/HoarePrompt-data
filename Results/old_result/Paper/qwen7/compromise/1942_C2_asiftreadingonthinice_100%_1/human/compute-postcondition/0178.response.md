Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is the total number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2 or is even, and `tmp` contains elements which are half the difference between consecutive elements of `a` when that difference is even. Additionally, if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even, `tmp` includes an additional element `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
