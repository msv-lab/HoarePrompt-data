Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` must be at least 1, and `ans` is 2. `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block:
- If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is set to 2 and `tmp` contains `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is 2 and `tmp` contains `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.
