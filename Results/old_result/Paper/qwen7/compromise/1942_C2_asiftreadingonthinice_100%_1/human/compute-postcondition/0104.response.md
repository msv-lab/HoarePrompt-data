Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `len(a)`, `ans` will be the total count of pairs `(a[i] - a[i - 1])` that are either 2 or even and equal to 2 modulo 2, `tmp` will be a list containing the sum of all values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for pairs where `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals 2 modulo 2, `y` will be the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` as many times as possible, `ans` will be incremented by `x + y - 2`, `ii` will be `k + 1`, `tt` will retain its original value since it is not modified in the loop, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even.**
