Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial conditions for `tt` and `ii` remain unchanged. Therefore, `tt` must still be greater than 0 and `ii` is still 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are the integers entered by the user.
