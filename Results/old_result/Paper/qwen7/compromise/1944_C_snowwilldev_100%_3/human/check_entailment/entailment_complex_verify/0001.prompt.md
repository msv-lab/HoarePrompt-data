You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is a defaultdict where the keys are the unique integers from the list `a` and the values are their respective counts after iterating through the list `a` for `N` times.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is a defaultdict where the keys are the unique integers from the list `a` and the values are their respective counts after iterating through the list `a` for `N` times; `t` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = N`. For each iteration, it checks if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1 and increments `t` if true. If `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2 or if `cnt[i]` is 0, it returns the current value of `i`. Since the loop starts with `t` set to 0 and the condition to return is based on the value of `t` reaching 2 or `cnt[i]` being 0, and given no specific values for `a` and `N`, the loop will only increment `t` but will not meet the return condition unless `cnt[i]` is 0 at any point or `t` reaches 2. Without specific values, we can't determine the exact `i` that would cause the return, but the count dictionary `cnt` and the variable `t` will remain as described.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of non-negative integers and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either `cnt[i]` is 0 (where `cnt` is a dictionary counting occurrences of each integer in `a`) or `t` (a counter incremented when `cnt[i]` equals 1) reaches 2. If no such `i` is found, the function returns the last index `N` checked.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Test Cases and Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - It then reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - This part is correct and necessary to determine the optimal strategy.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The program iterates from `0` to `N` and checks the count of each number.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if a number `i` does not appear at all (`cnt[i] == 0`), the function returns `i`.

### Correctness Check

To ensure the correctness, let's verify if the logic aligns with the problem requirements:

- **Alice's and Bob's Moves:**
  - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
  - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it without appending to `c`.

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

- **Key Insight:**
  - The MEX of `c` will be influenced by the numbers that are present in `c` and their counts.
  - If there are two unique numbers in `c` that are present exactly once, the MEX will be `2`.
  - If no number is present exactly once, the MEX will be `1` or `0` depending on the presence of `0` and `1`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the given example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 0 0 1 1`
  - `cnt = {0: 2, 1: 2}`
  - `t = 0`
  - Iterating:
    - `i = 0`: `cnt[0] == 2`, so `t` remains `0`.
    - `i = 1`: `cnt[1] == 2`, so `t` remains `0`.
  - Since `t < 2`, the function should return the next number where `cnt[i] == 0` or `cnt[i] == 1`. Here, `0` is returned, but the correct MEX should be `2` based on the example.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4 0 1 2 3`
  - `cnt = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
  - `t = 1`
  - Iterating:
    - `i = 0`: `cnt[0] == 1`, so `t` becomes `2`.
  - Since `t >= 2`, the function returns `0`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `2 1 1`
  - `cnt = {1: 2}`
  - `t = 0`
  - Iterating:
    - `i = 0`: `cnt[0] == 0`, so the function returns `0`, which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX value. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the MEX should be `2` in the first test case.
