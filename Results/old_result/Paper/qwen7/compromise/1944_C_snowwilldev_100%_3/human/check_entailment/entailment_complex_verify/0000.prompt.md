You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is a defaultdict where the keys are the unique integers from the list `a` and the values are their respective counts after iterating through the list `a` for `N` times.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is a defaultdict where the keys are the unique integers from the list `a` and the values are their respective counts after iterating through the list `a` for `N` times; `t` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = N`. For each iteration, it checks if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1 and increments `t` if true. If `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2 or if `cnt[i]` is 0, it returns the current value of `i`. Since the loop starts with `t` set to 0 and the condition to return is based on the value of `t` reaching 2 or `cnt[i]` being 0, and given no specific values for `a` and `N`, the loop will only increment `t` but will not meet the return condition unless `cnt[i]` is 0 at any point or `t` reaches 2. Without specific values, we can't determine the exact `i` that would cause the return, but the count dictionary `cnt` and the variable `t` will remain as described.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of non-negative integers and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either `cnt[i]` is 0 (where `cnt` is a dictionary counting occurrences of each integer in `a`) or `t` (a counter incremented when `cnt[i]` equals 1) reaches 2. If no such `i` is found, the function returns the last index `N` checked.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`. To do this, she should try to append elements that will make it harder for Bob to minimize the MEX.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob aims to minimize the MEX of the array `c`. To do this, he should try to remove elements that will make it easier for him to achieve a lower MEX.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not simulate these strategies. Instead, it simply counts how many times each number appears in the array and returns the smallest number that either appears exactly once or has no occurrences. This approach does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their respective goals.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

- **Case 1**: The output should be `2`, but the program incorrectly outputs `0`.
- **Case 2**: The output should be `1`, but the program incorrectly outputs `0`.
- **Case 3**: The output should be `0`, but the program incorrectly outputs `0`.

To correctly simulate the game, the program needs to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and ensure that each player makes optimal moves. The current implementation does not handle this logic, leading to incorrect results.
