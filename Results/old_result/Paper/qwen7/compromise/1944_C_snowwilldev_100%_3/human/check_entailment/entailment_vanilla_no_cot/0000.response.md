Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Strategy Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` tries to count how many times each number appears in the array `a`. However, it doesn't account for the different roles of Alice and Bob in picking elements.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a`, whereas Bob can only pick elements that are still present in `a`.

2. **Misunderstanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob properly. It simply counts occurrences of numbers without considering whose turn it is or what the optimal strategy would be for each player.
   - The logic to determine the MEX value at the end is also flawed because it doesn't reflect the actual sequence of moves made by Alice and Bob.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX value, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current implementation does not simulate these strategic choices.
   - The function should consider the optimal moves for both players, ensuring that Alice always makes a move that maximizes her chances of achieving a high MEX value, and Bob makes moves that minimize this value.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game according to the rules and ensure that each player plays optimally. This involves carefully managing the turns and updating the state of the arrays `a` and `c` accordingly.
