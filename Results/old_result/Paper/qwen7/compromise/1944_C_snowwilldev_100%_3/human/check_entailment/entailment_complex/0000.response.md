Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating MEX**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the MEX of the array `c` formed during the game. However, the logic inside the function does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX of `c`.
   - The function simply counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and then tries to find the smallest integer `i` such that `cnt[i]` is 0 or `t` reaches 2. This does not reflect the actual game dynamics where Alice and Bob take turns to form the array `c`.

2. **Game Dynamics Not Simulated**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns appending elements to `c` and deleting them from `a`. The provided code does not simulate these turns or build the array `c` as the game progresses.
   - The function should keep track of whose turn it is and ensure that Alice always appends an element to `c` and Bob always deletes an element from `a`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns an integer `i` based on the conditions mentioned, which do not align with the problem requirements. It does not correctly compute the MEX of the final array `c` formed by the optimal play of both players.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
