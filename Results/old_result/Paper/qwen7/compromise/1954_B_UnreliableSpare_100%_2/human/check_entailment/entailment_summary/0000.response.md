Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The provided solution attempts to solve this by checking if the array contains consecutive different elements and calculating the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the initial element.
4. However, the logic in `func_1()` does not correctly identify whether the array is beautiful or not, nor does it calculate the correct minimum number of elements to remove.
5. The solution incorrectly assumes that if there are no consecutive different elements, the array is not beautiful, which is not always true.
6. The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed because it only considers sequences of the initial element without accounting for the specific rules of making the array non-beautiful.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
