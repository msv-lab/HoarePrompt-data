Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, meaning `val` holds the value of the first element in the list `arr`.
- `cnt` is 0, meaning the count of consecutive occurrences of `val` is initially set to 0.
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` updated by 1 if `cnt` was previously assigned a value. Since `cnt` is initially 0, `ans` will be updated to 1.
- The flag is True, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will directly print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
