Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is True.**

Explanation: The line `flag = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `flag`. No other variables are affected, so their initial states remain unchanged.
