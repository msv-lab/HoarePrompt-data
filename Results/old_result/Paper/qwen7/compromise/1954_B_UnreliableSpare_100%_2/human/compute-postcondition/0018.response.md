Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` for each test case defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, with `a` being a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function returns whether the given array `a` is beautiful for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own `t`, `n`, and list `a`. It checks if the list `a` meets the criteria of being "beautiful" for each test case and returns a result accordingly.
