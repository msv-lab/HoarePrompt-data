Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is False.

Explanation: The loop checks if each element in `arr` is different from its previous element. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, `flag` will be `False` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements that are different. If all elements are the same or no two consecutive elements are different, `flag` remains `True`.
