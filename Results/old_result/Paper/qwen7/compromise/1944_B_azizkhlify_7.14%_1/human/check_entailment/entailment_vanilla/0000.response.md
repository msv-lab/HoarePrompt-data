Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Initialization of Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to store the selected elements.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are used to keep track of the number of elements added to `l` and `r` and their respective XOR values.

3. **Populating Array `l`:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the array `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each element in this half, it checks if the count of that element in `l` is 2. If so, it prints the element twice and increments `ul` by 2.
   - This ensures that `l` contains `2k` elements with the same XOR value.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - After populating `l` with `2k` elements, if fewer than `2k` elements are added, it tries to add more elements from the first half where the count is 1.
   - It prints these elements until `l` has `2k` elements.

5. **Populating Array `r`:**
   - The program iterates through the second half of the array `a` (from index `n` to `2n-1`).
   - It mirrors the logic used for `l` to ensure that `r` has `2k` elements with the same XOR value as `l`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` in two separate lines.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to populate `l` and `r` using the counts of elements in `a`. However, it does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal.
   - Specifically, the logic for selecting elements to fill `l` and `r` is flawed because it does not guarantee that the XOR values will match.

2. **Logic for Matching XOR Values:**
   - The program does not have a mechanism to ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal after populating them.
   - The approach of simply counting occurrences and printing elements does not guarantee that the XOR values will match.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
