Output State: **`re` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0, `res` contains the element `a[i]`, `res`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `res`. The values of `re`, `i`, `n`, and the variables `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged from their initial states.
