Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the object `res`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `res` that can be assigned to `i`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `re` is `k + 1`
   - `i` is the first element of `res`
   - `res` contains the elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 until `re` reaches `k + 1`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `res` using `i`, the next value of `i` will be the second element of `res`.
   - Therefore, `res` should now contain all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 except the first element.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `re` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `i` changes to the second element of `res`.
   - `res` is updated to exclude the first element.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`re` is `k + 1`, `i` is the second element of `res`, `res` contains the elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 until `re` reaches `k + 1`**
