Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is `2 * n`, `k` is `4 * k - ul`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated to `4 * k - ul`. Given that `ul` is 0, `k` becomes `4 * k`. The other variables (`res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
