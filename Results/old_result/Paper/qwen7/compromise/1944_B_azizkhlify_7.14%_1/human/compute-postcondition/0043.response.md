Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is an empty list.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 4.
- `ur` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is at least 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

However, there is no variable `a` mentioned in the initial state. Since `a` is not defined, it's impossible to determine its contents and thus what will be printed. Given this information, we cannot proceed with the print statement because `a` is undefined.

Output: **Error: 'a' is not defined**
