Based on the initial state provided, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. Since `i` was previously some index in the list `a`, after incrementing, `i` now points to the next element in the list. The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the element at this new index `i + 1`.

Given that `a` is a list and `i` is an index into this list, the value printed will be the element at position `i + 1` in the list `a`.

Output: **a[i + 1]**
