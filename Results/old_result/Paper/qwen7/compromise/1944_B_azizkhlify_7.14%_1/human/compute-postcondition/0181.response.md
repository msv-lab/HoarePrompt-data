Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

Given the initial state:
- Since `i` is 0, we need to determine the value of `a[i]`, which is `a[0]`.
- The condition `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1 means that `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 1. This implies that the element at index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1.

To find out what `a[0]` is, we need to consider the condition `i < n`. Since `i` is 0, this condition is satisfied for any positive integer `n`. However, the exact value of `a[0]` is not provided, but it must be such that `a[0] - 1` is a valid index in the list `l` and `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 1.

Since `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 1, we know that `a[0] - 1` is the index of 1 in the list `l`. Therefore, `a[0]` must be the index of 1 in the list `l` plus 1.

For example, if `l = [0, 1, 0, 0, ...]`, then `a[0]` would be 1 because `l[0]` is 0, `l[1]` is 1, and so on.

Thus, the value of `a[0]` is the index of 1 in the list `l` plus 1.

Output: **[index of 1 in l] (where the index is the position of the first 1 in the list l, plus 1)**
