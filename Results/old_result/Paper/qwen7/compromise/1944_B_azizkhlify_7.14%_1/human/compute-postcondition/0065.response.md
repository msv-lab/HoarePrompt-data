Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` is a list where if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, then `a[i]` is added to `res`.
   - `re` is equal to `k`.
   - `ul` is 0.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `i` is still less than `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `a[i]` is added to `res`.
   - If `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, then `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - Since `i` is still less than `n` and `n` must be greater than 0, the loop can continue as long as `i < n`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).
   - `n` remains the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, it stays the same.

6. **New State:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - `res`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, they stay the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`res` is a list where if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, then `a[i]` is added to `res`, `re` is equal to `k`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
