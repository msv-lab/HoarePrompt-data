Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `re` is 1, `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0, `res` contains the value of `a[i]`, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 1, the postcondition remains unchanged and we break out of the loop or conditional statement.**

This means that the loop or conditional statement has been broken, but the values of `i`, `re`, `n`, `res`, and the condition involving `l[a[i] - 1]` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
