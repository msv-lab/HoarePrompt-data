Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs (t, n, k, and an array a) where t is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, n and k are integers with specific ranges, and a is an array of length 2n with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. The function returns information based on these inputs.**
