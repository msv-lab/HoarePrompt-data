Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `2 * n`, `res` is empty, and both `ul` and `ur` are equal.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `res` contains elements and `ul` is not equal to `ur`. Each iteration increments `i` by 1, starting from `n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it prints `a[i]` twice and increments `ur` by 2. The loop breaks when `ul` equals `ur`. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `2 * n`, and assuming `res` was not empty initially and contained enough elements to allow the loop to run through all iterations without prematurely breaking (because `ul` would eventually equal `ur`), `res` will be empty by the end, and `ul` and `ur` will be equal.
