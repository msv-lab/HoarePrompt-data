Output State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. It also updates the value of `i` to `i_prev + 2`. The initial state of `r[a[i] - 1]` being incremented by 1 and `i` being `i_prev + 2` remains valid after the code execution.
