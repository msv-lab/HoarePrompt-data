Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`.
   - `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2.
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- Since `n` is less than or equal to the length of `res`, `i` is at least 1 and at most the length of `res` plus one.
- `ul` is `ur` + 2, but this does not affect the print statement directly.
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement.

Given that `a` is a list and `a[i]` refers to an element in the list `a` at index `i`, the print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the index `i`.

Output: **a[n+1] a[n+1]**
