Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range `[1, n-1]`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `re` is 0
   - `ul` is 0
   - `ur` is 0
   - `i` is within the range `[1, n-1]`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input
   - `res` is an empty list
   - `l` is a list of length `n` with each element initially set to 0
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is within the range `[1, n-1]`, the loop will continue if `i < n`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is within the range `[2, n-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` is an empty list, `l` is a list of length `n` with each element initially set to 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
