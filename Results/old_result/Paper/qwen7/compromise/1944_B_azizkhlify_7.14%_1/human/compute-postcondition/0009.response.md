Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `re` is 0.
   - `ul` is 0.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts from 0 in Python).
   - `n` must remain the same as it did not change within the loop body.
   - The other variables (`res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`) are not directly controlled by the loop and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**.
