Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`.
   - `ul` is equal to `ur`.
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state:
- Since `i` is equal to `n`, the value being printed will be `a[n]`.
- The value `a[i]` is printed twice, so it will print `a[n]` followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a[n] a[n]**
