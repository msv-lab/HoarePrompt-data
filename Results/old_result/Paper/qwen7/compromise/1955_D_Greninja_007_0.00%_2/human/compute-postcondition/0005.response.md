Output State: `good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of length `m` in list `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq` is greater than or equal to `k`. `a` is the list of integers with length `n`, `b` is the list of integers with length `m`, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the current window of `m` elements in list `a`, and `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.
