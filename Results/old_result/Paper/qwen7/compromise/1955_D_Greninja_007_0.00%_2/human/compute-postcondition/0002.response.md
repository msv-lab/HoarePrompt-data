Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in list b, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first m elements in list a, and k is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= m.**

Explanation: The code initializes `window_freq` as a Counter object that contains the frequency of the first `m` elements in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
