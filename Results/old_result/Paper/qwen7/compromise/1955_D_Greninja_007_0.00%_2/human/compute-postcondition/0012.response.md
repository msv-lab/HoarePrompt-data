Functionality: **The function accepts a list 'a' of integers, a list 'b' of integers, an integer 'k', an integer 'n', and an integer 'm'. It returns the number of subarrays in 'a' (of length 'm') where the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both 'window_freq' and 'b_freq' is greater than or equal to 'k'.**
