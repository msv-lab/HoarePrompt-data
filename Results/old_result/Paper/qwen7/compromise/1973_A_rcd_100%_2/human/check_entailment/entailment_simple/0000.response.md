Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible given the scoring rules.
4. It then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If so, it directly prints `p1 + p2` because this would mean no draws occurred.
5. If the above condition is not met, it enters a loop where it tries to find a combination of draws and wins/losses that fits the scores. It does this by incrementally increasing the number of draws (`x`) and decreasing the number of draws (`y`) until it finds a valid combination or exhausts all possibilities.
6. The logic for finding the maximum number of draws seems to be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - x <= p2 - y:` might not always lead to the correct maximum number of draws. For instance, consider the case `p1=1, p2=1, p3=2`. The current logic would incorrectly conclude that the maximum number of draws is `0` rather than `1`.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and may produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
