To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the problem statement and examples provided.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Score Validation:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is a necessary condition because each game contributes either 2 points (to one player) or 2 points (1 to each in case of a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This part is correct.

3. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The program then checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is incorrect. According to the problem, if `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it should be impossible to achieve these scores since the highest score (`p3`) cannot be greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores unless they are all zero. Therefore, the program should print `-1` in this case.

4. **Draw Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum number of draws using a while loop. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. The variable `x` represents the number of wins by the first player, and `y` represents the number of wins by the second player. The loop tries to find a combination where the first player has `p1 - x` wins and the second player has `p2 - y` wins, with the remaining points coming from draws.
   - The logic to increment `x` and decrement `y` in the loop does not correctly account for the possibility of draws. The program should consider the total points and distribute them among wins and draws.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 > p1 + p2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        max_draws = (total_points - 2 * (p1 + p2)) // 2
        if max_draws < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling:** Same as the original program.
2. **Score Validation:** Checks if the sum of the scores is even.
3. **Scoring Logic:** Checks if `p3 > p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `-1`.
4. **Draw Calculation:** Calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(total_points - 2 * (p1 + p2)) // 2`. This formula accounts for the points distributed among wins and draws.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the maximum number of draws. The corrected program above addresses these issues and should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

**Correctness: False**
