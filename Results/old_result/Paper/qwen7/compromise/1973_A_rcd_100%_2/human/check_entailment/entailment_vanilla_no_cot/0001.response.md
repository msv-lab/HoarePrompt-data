Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 1 point to each player in a draw.

3. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is a quick check to see if the scores can be achieved without any draws. However, this check alone is insufficient to ensure the scores are valid.

4. **Detailed Calculation:**
   - The program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `x` and `y` such that `x` represents the number of games where the first player won and `y` represents the number of games where the second player won.
   - The loop continues as long as `y >= x`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it increments `x` and decrements `y`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Insufficient Validation:**
   - The initial check `if p3 >= p1 + p2:` does not guarantee that the scores are achievable. For example, consider the case `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 2`, `p3 = 3`. Here, `p3 >= p1 + p2` is true, but the scores cannot be achieved with the given rules.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Draws:**
   - The logic inside the while loop assumes that the difference in points between the players can be balanced by the number of wins and draws. However, it does not correctly account for the possibility of draws affecting the score distribution.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the scores are inconsistent but the initial check passes.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct. It fails to handle some test cases correctly and does not provide the expected output for all valid scenarios.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, you would need to implement a more comprehensive validation and calculation method to ensure that the scores are achievable under the given rules.
