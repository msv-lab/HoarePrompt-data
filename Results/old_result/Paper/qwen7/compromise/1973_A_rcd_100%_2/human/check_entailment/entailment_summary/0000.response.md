Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points split between two players in a draw.
3. If the sum is odd, the program correctly prints \(-1\) and moves to the next test case.
4. If the sum is even, the program attempts to calculate the maximum number of draws. However, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the constraints and relationships between \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\).
5. The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of draws can be calculated by adjusting \(x\) and \(y\) until a condition is met, which does not always yield the correct result.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
