Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `y` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute the first time**: The loop will execute as long as `y >= x`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `_` is 1 (this variable is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`.

4. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - Since `x` is 0, the loop will execute if `y >= 0`.
   - Given that `y` is equal to `p3`, and `p3` is an integer entered by the user, `y` is already non-negative.

5. **Conclusion**: The loop condition `y >= x` is already satisfied with the current state because `y` is equal to `p3` and `x` is 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `y` or `x` for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`**
