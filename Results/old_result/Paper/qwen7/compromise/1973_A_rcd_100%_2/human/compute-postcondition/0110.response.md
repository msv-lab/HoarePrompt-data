Output State: The loop will continue to execute until either the condition `y >= x` is no longer true or the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, causing the loop to break. Given the constraints and the behavior described, once the loop breaks, it will print `p1 - x + p3`.

Since the loop continues to increment `x` and decrement `y` until `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true or `y < x`, the final values of `x` and `y` will satisfy `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. Therefore, the loop will break and print `p1 - x + p3`.

Output State: The value of `p1 - x + p3` will be printed when the loop breaks, where `x` and `y` are adjusted such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y`.
