Postcondition: `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user and must be an odd number, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3` and must be greater than or equal to 0, and the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true.
