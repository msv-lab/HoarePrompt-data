Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = p3
        while y >= x:
            if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                print(p1 - x + p3)
                break
            else:
                x += 1
                y -= 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and either:
- `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, in which case the current values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `_` are unchanged.
- The loop will terminate after a finite number of iterations based on the conditions provided. After all iterations, the variable `_` will be 0 if the loop breaks due to the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` being true, otherwise it will remain 1. The variables `x` and `y` will have reached their final values where `x` is the number of times the loop iterated without breaking (i.e., when `p1 - x > p2 - y`), and `y` will be `p3 - x`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will remain as they were initially entered by the user, and `t` will retain its initial value since it is not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 0 (or any value it reached during the last iteration which is between 0 and 4), `y` is 0, and if `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the function does not change these values. Otherwise, `p3` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program will output either `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` becomes true, or `p3` if the loop completes without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
