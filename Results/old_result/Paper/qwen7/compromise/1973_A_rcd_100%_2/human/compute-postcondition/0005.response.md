Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd also remains valid.
