Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`, and `x` is increased by 1.**

The value of `x` is incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
