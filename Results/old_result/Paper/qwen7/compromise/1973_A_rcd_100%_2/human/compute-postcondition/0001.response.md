State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, _ is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a common placeholder used in Python for loop indices when the value of the index itself is not needed within the loop body. It is typically an integer starting from 0.
- Since the loop runs for `t` iterations, the initial value of `_` should be 0, but after the first iteration, it becomes 1.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 to 500).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be a positive integer in the given range, and `_` should be set to 1 to indicate the start of the first iteration.
