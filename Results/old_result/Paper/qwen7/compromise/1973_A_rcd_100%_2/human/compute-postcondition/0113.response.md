Output State: **All values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the loop will have processed all `t` inputs. For each iteration, the loop checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If it is, the loop either prints `-1` and continues to the next iteration or calculates and prints a value based on the conditions provided. However, once all iterations are complete, the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `_` do not change their values outside the loop. The loop's effects are confined within each iteration, and once all iterations are done, the external state remains as it was before the loop started, with no additional changes applied.
