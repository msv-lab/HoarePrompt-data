Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user and must be an odd number, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 2 (since `x` was 1 and was incremented by 1), `y` is `p3 - 1` and must be greater than or equal to -1, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was initially set to `p3`, after the decrement, `y` becomes `p3 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
