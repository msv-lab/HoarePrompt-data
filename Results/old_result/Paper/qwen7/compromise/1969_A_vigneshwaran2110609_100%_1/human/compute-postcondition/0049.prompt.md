Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 10, `x` is an input integer greater than 9, `n` must be greater than 9, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 10, `x` must be at least 10, and if `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l[l[i] - 1]` does not equal `i + 1`, then no changes are made to `flag`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` remains 11, `x` is at least 11, and if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then `flag` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 12, `x` is at least 11, and if `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l[l[i] - 1]` does not equal `i + 1`, then the conditions remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
