Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables that can be adjusted. In this case, the loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, x):
   ```
   Therefore, the variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` remains 11.
   - `x` is at least 11.
   - If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then `flag` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` remains 11, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which is 12.
   - The condition `x` is at least 11 must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 12.
- `x` is at least 11.

The final answer is:
State: **`i` is 12, `x` is at least 11**
