### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` but only processes one test case. It does not loop to handle multiple test cases, which is a significant flaw. The original assessment correctly identifies this issue.

2. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the function reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`. This part is correct, but the function does not handle multiple test cases.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The loop `for i in range(0, n):` iterates over the list of friends.
   - The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:` checks if the best friend of the current friend also considers the current friend as their best friend. If this condition is met, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that sending invitations to just these two friends is sufficient.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function does not loop back to read more test cases after processing the first one. This is a critical oversight. The function should use a loop to iterate over all test cases.

### Correctness:
The original assessment correctly identified that the function only processes one test case and does not handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the function is incorrect as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The function needs to be modified to handle multiple test cases by using a loop around the entire test case processing logic. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(n):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function processes all test cases as required by the problem statement.
