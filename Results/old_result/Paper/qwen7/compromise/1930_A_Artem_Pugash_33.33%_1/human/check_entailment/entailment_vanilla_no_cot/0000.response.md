Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw. The issue lies in the way pairs of numbers are being selected and added to the score. Specifically, the code pops the first two elements from the sorted list in each iteration, which does not necessarily maximize the score.

To correctly solve this problem, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together to ensure we are maximizing the sum of the minimums at each step. This can be achieved by sorting the list and then iterating through it in steps of two, summing the pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()  # Sort the numbers in ascending order
        suma = 0
        # Iterate through the sorted list in steps of 2
        for j in range(0, len(numbers), 2):
            suma += numbers[j]  # Add the smaller of the pair to the score
        print(suma)
```

This corrected version ensures that we are always pairing the smallest available numbers, thus achieving the maximum possible score.
