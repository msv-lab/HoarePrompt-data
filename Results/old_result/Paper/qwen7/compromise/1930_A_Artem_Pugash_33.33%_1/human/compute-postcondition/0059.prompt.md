Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of input integers, `suma` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers with the first element removed, `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the first element of the original `numbers` list, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers with the first element removed, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list, `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)`, `a` is the second element of the original `numbers` list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers with the first element removed, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list, `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)`, `a` is the second element of the original `numbers` list, `numbers` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, `a` is now the first element of `numbers`, `suma` is updated by adding the minimum of `a` and `b` to its current value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
