Output State: **`numCases` is an input integer, and the values of `t` and `n` are not yet determined**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the given code snippet. The value of `numCases` is an integer input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and the subsequent 2n integers will be read, but these are not processed in the given code.
