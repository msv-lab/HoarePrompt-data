Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.sort(reverse=False)` sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order. The other variables (`numCases`, `i`, and `numInteger`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `numCases` must still be greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `numInteger` is still an input integer, and `numbers` is now a list of strings sorted in ascending order.
