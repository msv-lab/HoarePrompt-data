Output State: **`numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers with the first element removed, `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the second element of the original `numbers` list, `b` is the second element of the original `numbers` list.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and assigns it to `a`. Since `numbers` was initially a non-empty sorted list, after popping the first element, it remains a non-empty sorted list but with the first element removed. The value of `a` is now the second element of the original `numbers` list, and since `b` was defined as the first element of the original `numbers` list, it remains unchanged. All other variables (`numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `suma`) remain unaffected by this operation.
