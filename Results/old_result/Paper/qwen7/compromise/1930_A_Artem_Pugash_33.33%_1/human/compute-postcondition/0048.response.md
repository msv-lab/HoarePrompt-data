Output State: **`numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers without the first element, `suma` is 0, `a` is the first element of the original `numbers` list.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and assigns it to `a`. Since `numbers` was a non-empty sorted list, after popping the first element, it becomes a non-empty sorted list without its first element. All other variables remain unchanged.
