Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAb', `char_count[2]` is equal to 27**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. Here, `j` is 2, and `ord('a')` returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97. So, `j + ord('a')` equals 99, which is the ASCII value of 'c'. The string `s` initially is 'bab...zA', and appending 'c' to it results in 'bab...zAc'. Since `j` was 2 and we incremented it by 1 (as part of calculating the character), `j` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
