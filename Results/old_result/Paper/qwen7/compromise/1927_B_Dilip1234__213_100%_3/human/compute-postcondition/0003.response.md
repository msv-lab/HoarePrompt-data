State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable in the for loop is `j`, which is initialized to 0 by the `range(26)` function.
2. The initial value of `j` (which is 0) is within the range specified by `range(26)`, meaning the loop will execute at least once.
3. The variable `i` is not used in the loop head and its value does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.
4. The variable `n` is a positive integer, but it does not directly influence the loop's execution based on the given code snippet. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute.

Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the initial values of `j` and the fact that `n` is a positive integer (though this is already given).
