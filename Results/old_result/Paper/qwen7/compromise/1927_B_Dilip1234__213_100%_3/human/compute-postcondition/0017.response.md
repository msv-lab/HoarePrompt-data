Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is 'bab', `char_count[2]` is equal to 2**

The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. Here, `j` is 3, and `ord('a')` returns 97. So, `j + ord('a')` equals 100, which corresponds to the character 'd'. Thus, `s` changes from 'ba' to 'bab'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `char_count[2]` remain unchanged.
