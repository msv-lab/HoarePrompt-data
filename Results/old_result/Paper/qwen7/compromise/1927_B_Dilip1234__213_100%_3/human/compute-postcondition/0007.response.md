Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 1; `n` is a positive integer; `s` is 'b'; `char_count[1]` is equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `s`, or `char_count[1]`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently in. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
