Output State: **`i` is 26, `j` is 26, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAbbCdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaaaabbbbccccdddd....zzzzbz', `char_count[2]` is 27, `char_count[3]` is 31**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 26, `char_count[26]` (which is `char_count[3]` since array indices start from 0) is incremented by 1. Initially, `char_count[3]` is 30, so after the increment, it becomes 31. All other variables remain unchanged.
