Reasoning:
- The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 by printing "NO".
- For even values of `n`, the function constructs a string with pairs of 'A' characters, which ensures that every character except the first and last will be special (since they will each appear exactly once among their neighbors).
- For odd values of `n`, the function starts with 'AAA' and then adds pairs of 'A' characters, ensuring that the first three characters are special and the rest follow the same logic as for even `n`.
- The function checks the constraints for `t` and `n` as specified in the problem statement.
- The function prints "YES" followed by the constructed string for valid cases and "NO" for invalid cases.

Given the above points, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem accurately.

Correctness: **True**
