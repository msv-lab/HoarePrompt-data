You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads another integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` consisting of the letter 'A' repeated in a specific pattern based on the value of `n`. If `n` is even, `ans` contains pairs of letters 'A' up to `n//2` times. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of letters 'A' up to `n//2 - 1` times. After processing all test cases, the function prints 'YES' for each valid `n` and outputs the constructed string `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program clears the screen using `os.system('cls')`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Character Logic:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of length 1.
   - Otherwise, the program constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The program uses the uppercase Latin alphabet (`string.ascii_uppercase`).
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string where every pair of adjacent characters is different and counts towards the special character count.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then constructs the rest of the string similarly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case when `n` is odd by starting with 'AAA' and then adding pairs of different characters.
   - The construction logic ensures that each character is special (appears exactly once in its immediate neighborhood).

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

#### Test Case 1: \( n = 6 \)
- Expected output: `YES\nAAABAACC`
- Explanation: The string `AAABAACC` has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8).

#### Test Case 2: \( n = 1 \)
- Expected output: `NO`
- Explanation: It's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of length 1.

#### Test Case 3: \( n = 2 \)
- Expected output: `YES\nMM`
- Explanation: The string `MM` has 2 special characters (both positions 1 and 2).

### Verification

Let's verify the program against these test cases:

```python
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

# Test Case 1
func()  # Should print: NO

# Test Case 2
func()  # Should print: YES\nAAABAACC

# Test Case 3
func()  # Should print: NO

# Test Case 4
func()  # Should print: YES\nMM
```
