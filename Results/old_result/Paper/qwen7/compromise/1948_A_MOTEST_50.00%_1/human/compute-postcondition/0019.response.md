Output State: **`ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x_prev + 3]`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is now `x_prev + 3`, `j` is `j_prev + 2` and must be less than `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given that `x` was previously `x_prev + 2`, after executing the code, `x` becomes `x_prev + 3`. All other conditions and constraints remain the same. Therefore, `ans` is updated to be the previous value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x_prev + 3]`.
