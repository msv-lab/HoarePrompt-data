Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `x` after incrementation cannot be determined without knowing its initial value. However, we know that `x` was previously used to access `s[x]` to calculate `ans`. The conditions on `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
