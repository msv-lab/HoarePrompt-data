Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads another integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` consisting of the letter 'A' repeated in a specific pattern based on the value of `n`. If `n` is even, `ans` contains pairs of letters 'A' up to `n//2` times. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of letters 'A' up to `n//2 - 1` times. After processing all test cases, the function prints 'YES' for each valid `n` and outputs the constructed string `ans`.**
