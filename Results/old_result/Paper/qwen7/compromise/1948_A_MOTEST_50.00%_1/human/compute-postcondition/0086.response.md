Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n // 2)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be less than `n // 2`
   - `i` is `t + 2`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `ans` is `s[1] * 4`
   - `x` is 2
   - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `j < n // 2`. Since `j` is currently `n // 2 - 1`, the next value of `j` will be `n // 2`.
   - Therefore, `j` needs to be updated to `n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - `t`, `i`, `ans`, `x`, and `n` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` must still be less than `n // 2`.
   - `i` remains `t + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains `s[1] * 4`.
   - `x` remains 2.
   - `j` is now `n // 2`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be less than `n // 2`, `i` is `t + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is `s[1] * 4`, `x` is 2, `j` is `n // 2`**
