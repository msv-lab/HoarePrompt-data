Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `t-1`. This means the loop will run `t` times.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be at least 1.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` should be `t - 1` (the last value it took in the previous iteration).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will execute one more time, `i` will be `t - 1`.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations the loop will run.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t - 1`**
