State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it will iterate.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, the smallest possible value for `t` is 1.
4. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

Since the only variable involved in the loop head is `t`, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, the state adjustment is as stated above.
