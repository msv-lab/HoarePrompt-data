Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checking for Special Characters:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd (as explained in the problem statement).

3. **Generating the String:**
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a string `s` consisting of "110" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - This string is checked to ensure its length is less than 200.
     - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string.
     - If the length exceeds 200, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:

1. **String Generation:**
   - The string `s` generated using "110" repeated `n // 2` times does not necessarily meet the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, the generated string would be "110110", which has 4 special characters (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5), not 6.

2. **Special Character Requirement:**
   - The problem requires exactly `n` special characters where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The generated string "110110" does not satisfy this condition for `n = 6`.

### Correct Solution Approach:

To generate a string with exactly `n` special characters, we need to construct a pattern that ensures the required number of special characters. One possible approach is to use a repeating pattern like "ABAC" or similar, ensuring that the special character count matches `n`.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Generate a string with exactly n special characters
            if n == 2:
                print('YES')
                print('AB')
            elif n == 4:
                print('YES')
                print('ABCA')
            else:
                # General pattern to ensure n special characters
                s = 'A' + 'B' * ((n - 2) // 2) + 'C' + 'A' * ((n - 2) // 2)
                print('YES')
                print(s)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not generate strings with exactly `n` special characters. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
