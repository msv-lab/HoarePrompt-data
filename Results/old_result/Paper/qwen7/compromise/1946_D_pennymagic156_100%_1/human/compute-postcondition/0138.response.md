Postcondition: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`. If both `u` and `v` are 0, no changes are made. Otherwise, if `v` is odd, no changes are made. If `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is set to the length of the list `a`. If `v` is 0, `ans` remains either -1 or 0.
