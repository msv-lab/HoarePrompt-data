Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `t` is a list with two additional elements `ai`.**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. The other variables (`a`, `val`, `op`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
