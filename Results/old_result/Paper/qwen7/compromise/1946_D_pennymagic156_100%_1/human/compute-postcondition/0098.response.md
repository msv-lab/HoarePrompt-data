Output State: **`t` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`, `val` is 0**

Explanation: The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` (which is 0) to the list `t`. Initially, `t` contains `[0, 0]`. After appending `0`, `t` becomes `[0, 0, 0]`. The values of other variables (`ans`, `i`, `op`, `ai`, `u`, `v`, `val`) remain unchanged.
