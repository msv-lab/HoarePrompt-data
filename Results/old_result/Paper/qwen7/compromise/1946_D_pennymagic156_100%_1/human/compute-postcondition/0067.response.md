Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not 0, `v` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. All other variables retain their initial states.
