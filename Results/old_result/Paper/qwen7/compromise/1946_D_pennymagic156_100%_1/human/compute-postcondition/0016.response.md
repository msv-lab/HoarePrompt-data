Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is 0, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `a` must be a non-empty list**

The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
