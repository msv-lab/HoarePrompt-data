Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 27, `u` is `a[0] >> 27 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`, and it must be even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ (a[0] >> 28 & 1)`, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Given that `i` is initially 28, the code effectively updates `op` to `op ^ (a[0] >> 28 & 1)`. Since `a[0] >> 28 & 1` is the same as `u`, `op` is updated to `op ^ u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
