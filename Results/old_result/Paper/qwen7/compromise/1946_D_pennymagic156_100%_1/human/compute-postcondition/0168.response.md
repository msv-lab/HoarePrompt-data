Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `val` is undefined, `op` is the final result of the loop, `ai` is 0, `t` is a list containing all unique values of `ai` where `op` was `False` during the loop execution.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will be empty because each element of `a` is processed once and then removed from consideration within the loop. The variable `val` is no longer relevant as it refers to the current element being processed in the loop, which no longer exists. The variable `op` will hold the final result of the XOR operation across all elements of `a` shifted right by `i` bits. The variable `ai` will be 0 since it is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration. The list `t` will contain all values of `ai` that were appended to it when `op` was `False` during the loop execution, effectively collecting all values of `ai` that resulted in `op` being `False` at the point of appending.
