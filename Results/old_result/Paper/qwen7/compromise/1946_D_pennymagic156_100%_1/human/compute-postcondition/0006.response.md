Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
