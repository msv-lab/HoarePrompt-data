Output State: **`op` is False, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `val` is the next element in `a` after `val_next`, `t` is a list containing ['ai ^ val_next', 'ai ^ val_next'], `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, `v` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
