Output State: **`t` is [], `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`**

Explanation: The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `a` and `t`. Initially, `t` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` and `a` is undefined. After the swap, `t` becomes an empty list `[]`, and `a` takes the place of `t`, which was initially `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`. However, since `a` is not defined before the swap, its value remains undefined. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `op`, `ai`, `u`, and `v`) are not affected by this operation.
