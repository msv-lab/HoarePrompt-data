The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 27, `u` is `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`.**
