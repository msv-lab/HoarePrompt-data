Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 0 ^ (val >> 28 & 1), `ai` is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]**.

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here, `i` is 28, so the operation `val >> 28 & 1` checks the 28th bit of `val`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `val`, we cannot determine the exact value of `op` without knowing `val`. However, we know that `op` is initially 0 and it is being XORed with the 28th bit of `val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
