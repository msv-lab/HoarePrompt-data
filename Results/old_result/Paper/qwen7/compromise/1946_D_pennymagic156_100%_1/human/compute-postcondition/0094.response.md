Postcondition: **`t` is a list containing `[0, 0]`, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`, `val` is the next element in the list `a`**.

This postcondition reflects that the `if` condition `not op` is true, leading to the execution of the if part where `t` becomes `[0, 0]`, `ans` remains either -1 or 0, `i` stays 28, `op` is set to 0, `ai` is 0, `u` remains as `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`, and `val` is the next element in the list `a`. Since there is no else part, these changes apply regardless of the value of `op`.
