Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `ai` is updated by performing `ai ^= val`, `t` is a list containing the value of `ai` after the bitwise XOR operation with `val`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the current value of `ai` (after it was updated by the bitwise XOR operation `ai ^= val`) to the list `t`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
