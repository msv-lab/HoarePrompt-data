Postcondition: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 29, `u` is not 0, `v` is 0, and either we continue the loop with `ans` as -1, or `ans` is set to the final result of the XOR operation over all elements in `a` shifted right by `i` positions and masked with 1, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
