Output State: **`t` is a list containing `[0, 0]`, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 1, `ai` is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`, `val` is the next element in the list `a`**

Explanation: The code `ai = 0` sets the value of `ai` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
