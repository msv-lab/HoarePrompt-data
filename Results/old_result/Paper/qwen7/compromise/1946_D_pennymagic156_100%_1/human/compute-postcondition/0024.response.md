Output State: **`t` is a list containing ['ai ^ val_next'], `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, `v` is 0, `op` is True, `ai` is `ai ^ val_next`, `val` is `val_next`**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. Since the initial value of `ai` is 0 and `val` is `val_next`, the new value of `ai` becomes `0 ^ val_next`, which simplifies to `val_next`. All other variables remain unchanged.
