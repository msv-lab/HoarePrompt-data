Output State: **`sumo` is 22, `a[i]` is `prod // 20`, `i` is 3, `bets` is 5**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given that `a[i]` is `prod // 20` and `sumo` initially is 20, after executing the code, `sumo` becomes `20 + (prod // 20)`. Since `i` is 3 and `bets` is 5, these values remain unchanged.
