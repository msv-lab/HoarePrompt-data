Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their GCD when taken pairwise, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[3])`**.

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3 initially, and after executing the line `i += 1`, `i` becomes 4. Therefore, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[3])`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
