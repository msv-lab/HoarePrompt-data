Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their GCD when taken pairwise, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `a[i-1]`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the value of `a[i]`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`. After executing the line, `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, `sumo` now includes the value of `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
