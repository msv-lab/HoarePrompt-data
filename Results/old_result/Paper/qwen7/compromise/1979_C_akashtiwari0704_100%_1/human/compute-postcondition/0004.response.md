Output State: **`t` is 0, `g` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to be the product of its current value (`g`) and the value at index `i` of the list `l` (i.e., `l[i]`). Since `i` is initially 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[0]`. Given that `g` was initially 1, the new value of `g` is `1 * l[0]`, which simplifies to `l[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
