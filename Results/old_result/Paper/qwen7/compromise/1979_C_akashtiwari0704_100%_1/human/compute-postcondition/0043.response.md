Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `bets * 2 - 2`.
- `ans` is the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, with each element separated by a space.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the concatenated string of all elements in the list `a`, with each element separated by a space.

Output: **the concatenation of all elements in list `a` separated by spaces**
