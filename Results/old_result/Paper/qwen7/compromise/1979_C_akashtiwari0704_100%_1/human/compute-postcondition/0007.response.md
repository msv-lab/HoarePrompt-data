Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `l`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`
   - `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element
   - `i` is 2

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `l`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute again if the length of `l` is greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `g` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` must still have at least 1 element, but we need to ensure that its length is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`t` is 0, `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 3**
