Output State: `bets` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop was set to run, `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their GCD when taken pairwise, `i` is the length of list `l`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `a[i-1]` for each iteration of the loop, with each `a[i-1]` being updated to `prod // a[i-1]` during the respective iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `bets` will be at least as large as the total number of iterations, `t` remains 0, `g` stays as the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their GCD, `i` will be equal to the length of list `l`, `a` remains as the list of integers obtained from input, `prod` stays as the LCM of all elements in list `a`, and `sumo` is the sum of all updated values of `a[i-1]` after each iteration of the loop.
