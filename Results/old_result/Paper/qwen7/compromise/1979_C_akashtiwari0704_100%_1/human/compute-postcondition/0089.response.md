Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `len(l)` must be at least 8**.

This means that the variable `g` has been updated to its current value multiplied by `l[i]` (where `i` is an index into the list `l`) and then divided by the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[i]`. The length of the list `l` remains at least 8.
