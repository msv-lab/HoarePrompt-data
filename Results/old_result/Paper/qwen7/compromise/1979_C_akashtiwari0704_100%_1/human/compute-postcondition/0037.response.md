Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(bets)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans` is 'a[0]'

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `bets`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again if `bets` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to update the value of `i` to reflect the next iteration and ensure that `bets` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
- `bets` must still be greater than 0.

Since the state of `ans` is not directly affected by the loop head, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is 'a[0]', `bets` must be greater than 0**
