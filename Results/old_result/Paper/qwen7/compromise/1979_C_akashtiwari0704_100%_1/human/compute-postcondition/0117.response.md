Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `bets`, and `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10.
- `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 8 to `bets-1`.
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 8 to `bets-1`.
- `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This print statement simply outputs the integer `-1`. Since there are no variables or expressions being evaluated within this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **-1**
