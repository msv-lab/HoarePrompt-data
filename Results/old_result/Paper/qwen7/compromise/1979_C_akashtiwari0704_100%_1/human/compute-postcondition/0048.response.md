Output State: **`i` is 0, `bets` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `t` remains 0, `g` is `l[0]`, `prod` remains unchanged, `sumo` remains unchanged, `T` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`. Since `g` was initially 1, the new value of `g` becomes `l[0]` (as `1 * l[0] // gcd(1, l[0])` simplifies to `l[0]`). All other variables remain unchanged.
