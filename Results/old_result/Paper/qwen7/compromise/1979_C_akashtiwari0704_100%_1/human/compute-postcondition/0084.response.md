Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is a string `"11 11 11 "`
- `i` is 8
- `bets` is 5
- `sumo` is 33

The code snippet is:
```python
print(ans)
```

Let's break down the process:

1. The loop runs for the number of times specified by `bets`, which is 5.
2. During each iteration, the value of `a[i]` (which is 11) is converted to a string and appended to `ans` followed by a space.
3. After 3 iterations, `i` is incremented by 3 (from 5 to 8).
4. Since the loop runs 5 times in total, `i` will be 10 after the final iteration.

However, the `print(ans)` statement only depends on the initial value of `ans` because the loop modifies `i` but does not affect the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` remains `"11 11 11 "` after the loop completes.

Output: **11 11 11**
