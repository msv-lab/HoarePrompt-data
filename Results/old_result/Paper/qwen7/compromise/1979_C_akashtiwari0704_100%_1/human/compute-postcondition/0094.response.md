Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, which means `g` is now the result of multiplying its current value by `l[i]` and then dividing by their greatest common divisor. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 2. The condition that `len(l)` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid, but since the value of `i` has changed, we only update `g` and `i` in the output state.
