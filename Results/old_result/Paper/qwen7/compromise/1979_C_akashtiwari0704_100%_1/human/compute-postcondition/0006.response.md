Output State: **`t` is 0, `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: Initially, `g` is set to `l[0]`. The code updates `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, where `i` is 1. So, `g` becomes `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented to 2.
