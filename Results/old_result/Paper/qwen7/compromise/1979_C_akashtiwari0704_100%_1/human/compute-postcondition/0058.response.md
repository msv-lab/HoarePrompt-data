Output State: **`bets` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `t` remains 0, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `a` is now a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `prod` remains unchanged, `sumo` remains unchanged, `T` remains unchanged, and `l` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by taking input from the user, splitting it by spaces, and converting each element to an integer. This means that `a` will now be a list containing the integers from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
