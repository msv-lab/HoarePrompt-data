Output State: **`cur` is -1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, either `L[0]` is equal to 1 or `R[0]` is to `N`. Moreover, `M1` is greater than 1 or `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `L[-1] - 1` to the variable `i`. The value of `i` is updated, but no other variables are affected. The initial conditions and values of `cur`, `t`, `R`, `L`, `M1`, `M2`, `ans`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged.
