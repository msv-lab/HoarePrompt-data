Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, L is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `L`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The initial values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are no longer relevant since they were not used in the code.
