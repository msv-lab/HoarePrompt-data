Output State: **`cur` is -1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, either `L[0]` is equal to 1 or `R[0]` is equal to `N`. Moreover, `M1` is less than or equal to 1 or `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `M1 - 2`. Since the initial value of `M1` is not specified, we represent it as `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
