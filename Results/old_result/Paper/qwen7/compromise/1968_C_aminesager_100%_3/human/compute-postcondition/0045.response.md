Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `T`. The `result` remains as "1000", `t` is `t - 1`, and `T` is a list of integers created by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, the list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element starting from the second one is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `T`. The `result` and `t` remain unchanged, and `T` retains the list of integers split from the input string `line`.
