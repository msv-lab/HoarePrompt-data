Output State: **`i` is `n`, `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is `n`, the value being appended is `a[n - 1] + T[n - 1]`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as `n`, and the list `a` is updated by adding this new value.
