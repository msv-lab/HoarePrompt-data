Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is less than `n`
- `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to it.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer less than `n`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Determine the Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop is defined as `range(1, n)`, the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration must be `n-1` (because the loop would stop when `i` becomes `n`).

2. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `n`.
   - The condition for the next iteration will be checked with `i = n` and `i < n` will be `False`, so the loop will terminate.

### Final State
- `i` will be `n` (since it will be incremented from `n-1`).
- `a` will remain unchanged because the loop will not execute again.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `n`, `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to it.**

However, since the loop will not execute again, the final state should reflect that the loop is done.

### Corrected Final State
State: **`i` is `n`, `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to it, and the loop will not execute again.**
