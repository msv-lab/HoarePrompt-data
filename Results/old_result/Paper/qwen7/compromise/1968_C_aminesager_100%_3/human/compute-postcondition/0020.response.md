Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is false, `line` is the input string entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
