Output State: **`i` is `n`, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding value from the list `T` up to `n-1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of list `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `line` is the string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers created by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` creates a list `T` by splitting the string `line` into individual elements, converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creating a list from these mapped integers. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
