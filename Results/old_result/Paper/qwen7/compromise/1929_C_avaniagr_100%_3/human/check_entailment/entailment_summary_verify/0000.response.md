### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- Sasha needs to ensure he can achieve any number of coins \(n\).
- The casino rules state that if Sasha wins, his coins increase by \(y \cdot (k - 1)\), where \(y\) is the bet amount.
- If Sasha loses, he loses the entire bet amount \(y\).
- Sasha cannot lose more than \(x\) times in a row.
- Initially, Sasha has \(a\) coins.

#### Program Analysis:
The program processes each test case by reading three integers \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\). It then evaluates different conditions to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins.

1. **Case 1: \(x < k - 1\)**

   ```python
   if x < k - 1:
       if a >= x + 1:
           print('YES')
       else:
           print('NO')
   ```

   - If \(x < k - 1\), Sasha can afford to lose up to \(x\) times in a row.
   - If \(a \geq x + 1\), Sasha can start with a bet of 1 coin and continue betting 1 coin after each loss until he wins.
   - If \(a < x + 1\), Sasha cannot start with a bet of 1 coin and thus cannot achieve any number of coins.

2. **Case 2: \(x == k - 1\)**

   ```python
   elif x == k - 1:
       if a >= x + 2:
           print('YES')
       else:
           print('NO')
   ```

   - If \(x == k - 1\), Sasha can afford to lose exactly \(k - 1\) times in a row.
   - If \(a \geq x + 2\), Sasha can start with a bet of 1 coin and continue betting 1 coin after each loss until he wins.
   - If \(a < x + 2\), Sasha cannot start with a bet of 1 coin and thus cannot achieve any number of coins.

3. **Case 3: \(x > k - 1\)**

   ```python
   else:
       z = k - 2
       for i in range(x - k + 3):
           z += z // (k - 1) + 1
       if a >= z:
           print('YES')
       else:
           print('NO')
   ```

   - If \(x > k - 1\), Sasha can afford to lose more than \(k - 1\) times in a row.
   - The variable `z` is calculated to represent the minimum number of coins required to guarantee a win after \(x - k + 3\) losses.
   - If \(a \geq z\), Sasha can achieve any number of coins.
   - If \(a < z\), Sasha cannot achieve any number of coins.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The program logic seems to correctly handle the conditions based on the problem description. Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1: \(k = 2\), \(x = 1\), \(a = 7\)**

   - \(x < k - 1\) (1 < 1) is false.
   - \(x == k - 1\) (1 == 1) is true.
   - \(a \geq x + 2\) (7 >= 3) is true.
   - Output: 'YES'

2. **Test Case 2: \(k = 2\), \(x = 1\), \(a = 1\)**

   - \(x < k - 1\) (1 < 1) is false.
   - \(x == k - 1\) (1 == 1) is true.
   - \(a \geq x + 2\) (1 >= 3) is false.
   - Output: 'NO'

3. **Test Case 3: \(k = 2\), \(x = 3\), \(a = 15\)**

   - \(x < k - 1\) (3 < 1) is false.
   - \(x == k - 1\) (3 == 1) is false.
   - \(x > k - 1\) (3 > 1) is true.
   - \(z = 2\)
     - \(z += 2 // 1 + 1 = 4\)
     - \(z += 4 // 1 + 1 = 6\)
     - \(z += 6 // 1 + 1 = 10\)
     - \(z += 10 // 1 + 1 = 12\)
     - \(z += 12 // 1 + 1 = 16\)
   - \(a \geq z\) (15 >= 16) is false.
   - Output: 'NO'

The program correctly handles the conditions and outputs the expected results for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
