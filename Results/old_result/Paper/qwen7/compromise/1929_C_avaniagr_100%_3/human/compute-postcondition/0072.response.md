Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`.
   - `x` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the next line `s`.
   - `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`.
   - `z` is calculated as `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to either `x - k + 3` or `x - k + 2` depending on whether `a >= z` is true or false.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

Given the code snippet, it directly prints the string `'YES'`. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z` do not affect the output of this specific print statement. Therefore, regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z`, the output will always be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
