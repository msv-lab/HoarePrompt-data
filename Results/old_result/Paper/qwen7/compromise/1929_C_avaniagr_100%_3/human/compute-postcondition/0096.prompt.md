Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`. After executing the if-else block, if `x < k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, if `x < k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then `a` is less than or equal to `x`. If `x = k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 2` or less than or equal to `x + 1`. If neither of the above conditions is met, `z` is equal to \(2^n \times (k - 1) + n\), where `n` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `i` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged; if `a` is less than `z`, then `a` remains unchanged as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the next line `s`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, and `z` is `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to either `x - k + 3` or `x - k + 2` depending on whether `a >= z` is true or false. If `x` equals `k - 1`, no changes are made to `z`. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, no changes are made to `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the next line `s`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, and `z` is as follows:
- If `x < k - 1`, then `z` remains unchanged.
- If `x == k - 1`, then `z` is `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to either `x - k + 3` or `x - k + 2` depending on whether `a >= z` is true or false.
- Otherwise, `z` is the result of repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself, starting from the initial value of `k - 2`, for a total of `x - k + 3` times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
