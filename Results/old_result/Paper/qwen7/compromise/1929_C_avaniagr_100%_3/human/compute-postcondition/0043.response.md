Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`. After executing the if-else block, if `x < k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, if `x < k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then `a` is less than or equal to `x`. If `x = k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 2` or less than or equal to `x + 1`. If neither of the above conditions is met, `z` is equal to \(2^n \times (k - 1) + n\), where `n` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `i` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged; if `a` is less than `z`, then `a` remains unchanged as well.
