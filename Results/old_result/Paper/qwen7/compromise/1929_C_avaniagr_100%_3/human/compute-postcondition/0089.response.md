Based on the initial state described:

- `z` is calculated by repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself, starting from the initial value of `k - 2`, for a total of `x - k + 3` times.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any variables or their computed values.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
