Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integer values of the first, second, and third space-separated tokens from the next line `s`, respectively.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since no specific values for `k`, `x`, and `a` are provided, they will not affect the output of the print statement.

Output: **'NO'**
