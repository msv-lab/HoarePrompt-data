Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 due to the nature of the code snippet provided, making it 2.
