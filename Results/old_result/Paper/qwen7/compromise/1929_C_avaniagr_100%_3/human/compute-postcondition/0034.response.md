Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`, `z` is equal to \(2^n \times (k - 1) + n\), where `n` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `i` is `i + 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `z` will be equal to \(2^n \times (k - 1) + n\), where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop ran. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
