Output State: **`d` is `n-3`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` has `v` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, and `d` is `n-3`, the value of `v` remains unchanged unless it changes within the function call, which is not specified. Therefore, `v` and `u` retain their original values, and `path` now includes the value of `v`.
