Output State: **`d` is `n-2`, `v` is a vertex, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`.**

Explanation: The code `path.append(v)` appends the vertex `v` to the list `path`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
