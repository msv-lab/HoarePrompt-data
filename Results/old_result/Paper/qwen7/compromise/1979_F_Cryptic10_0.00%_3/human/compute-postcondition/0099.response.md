Output State: **`d` is `n-3`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `u` is still the return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` has `v` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code removes the value `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. The other variables (`d`, `u`, and `path`) remain unchanged from their initial states. `v` was initially part of `path`, so after the removal, `v` is still in `path`, but it has been removed from `remaining_vertices`.
