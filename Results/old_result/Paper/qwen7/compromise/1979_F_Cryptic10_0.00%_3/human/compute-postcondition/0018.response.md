The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the execution of `continue` does not change any variable values or add new information about the state. The variables `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` retain their original values.

Output State: **`path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` is `v - 2`.**
