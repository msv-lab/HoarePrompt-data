Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex.**

This means that the function `func_1(d)` has been called with the argument `d`, which is `n-1`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged from their initial states.
