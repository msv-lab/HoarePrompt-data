Output State: **d is 0, v and u are the return values of func_1(0), path contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex v (if applicable), and remaining_vertices does not contain the vertex v (if applicable).**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `d` will decrement from `n-1` to `0`. The loop will continue to call `func_1(d)` and process the returned values `v` and `u`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it will be removed and the loop will break. The `path` list will accumulate all processed vertices `v` until the loop terminates. By the end of the loop, `d` will be `0`, and the final state of `v` and `u` will be the result of the last call to `func_1(0)`. The `remaining_vertices` set will not contain `v` if the loop broke due to finding `v` in `remaining_vertices`.
