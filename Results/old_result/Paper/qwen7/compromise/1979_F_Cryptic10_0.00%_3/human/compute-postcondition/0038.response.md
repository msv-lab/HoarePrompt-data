Output State: **`v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. Since the exact nature and values of `v` and `u` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, they are represented as the return values of `func_1(d)`. All other variables from the initial state remain unchanged.
