The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. If `remaining_vertices` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is empty. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex.

State: **`d` is -1, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex**
