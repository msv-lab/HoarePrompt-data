Output State: **`v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, `v` is in `remaining_vertices` is no longer true, and `path` now includes the value of `v`.**

Explanation: The code removes `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. Since `v` was previously in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer there after the removal. The other variables (`u` and `path`) remain unchanged.
