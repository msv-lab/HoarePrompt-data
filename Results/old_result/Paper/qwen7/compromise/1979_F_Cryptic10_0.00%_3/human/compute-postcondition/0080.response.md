Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is a vertex present in the updated `remaining_vertices`, `path` now contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` has the vertex `v` removed.**

Explanation: The code removes the vertex `v` from the `remaining_vertices` list. Since `v` was present in `remaining_vertices`, its removal updates the list. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
