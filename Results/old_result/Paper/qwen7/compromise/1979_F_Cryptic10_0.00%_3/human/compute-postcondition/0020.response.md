Output State: **`path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` is `v - 2`, and the value of `path` is updated by appending `v` to it.**

This means that the `path` list has had the vertex `v` appended to its beginning, while the `remaining_vertices` list still does not contain the vertex `v`, and the value of `d` remains `v - 2`.
