Output State: **`v` is equal to `d - 3`, `u` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path` now includes `v` as its last element but `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to the variables `v`, `u`, `path`, or `remaining_vertices` within the given code snippet, their states remain the same. The only change is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was inside.
