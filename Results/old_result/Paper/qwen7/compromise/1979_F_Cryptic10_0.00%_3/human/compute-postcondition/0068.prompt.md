Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, `remaining_vertices` is empty, and `d` is -1
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, we continue the loop or iteration. If `v` is not 0 and it is not in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we do not change the state of `v` and `u`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` contains `v`, `remaining_vertices` has had the vertex `v` removed from it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `d` is `d - 2`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the value of `v` (if `v` does not equal 0), `remaining_vertices` has removed the vertex `v` from its list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
