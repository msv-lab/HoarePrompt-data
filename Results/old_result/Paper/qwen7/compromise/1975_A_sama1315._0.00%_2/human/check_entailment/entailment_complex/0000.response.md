Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The provided solution attempts to solve this by checking if the array is already sorted or if it has a specific structure that allows sorting through the described operation.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted (`all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`). If true, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if there are no consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second (`any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`). If true, it returns 'No'.
   - If neither condition is met, it implies the array has a structure that can be sorted by the described operation, so it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input, extracts the necessary values, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - `func_1` correctly identifies if the array can be sorted by the described operation.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` appropriately.

Given the analysis, the provided functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
