Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 1000), n (an integer between 2 and 50), and arr (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6). The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input parameters.**

This means the function `func_2` takes in an integer `t` that must be between 1 and 1000, an integer `n` that must be between 2 and 50, and a list `arr` containing `n` integers, each of which must be between 1 and 10^6. The function does not return any value; instead, it processes these inputs according to some unspecified logic.
