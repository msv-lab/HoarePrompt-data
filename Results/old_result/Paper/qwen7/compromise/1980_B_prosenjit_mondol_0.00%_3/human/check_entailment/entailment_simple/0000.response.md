Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` and adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-indexed.
3. It then reads the list of integers `a` and sorts it in non-increasing order.
4. The program compares the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list (`a[k]`) with the value of the favorite cube (`x`).
   - If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, it prints 'NO', meaning the favorite cube was not removed.
   - If `a[k]` is less than `x`, it prints 'YES', meaning the favorite cube was definitely removed.
   - If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, it checks further conditions:
     - If `k` is the last index (i.e., `k == n - 1`), it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube would be removed.
     - If the value at the `(k-1)`-th position is less than `x`, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube would be removed.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' indicating uncertainty about whether the favorite cube was removed.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all cases correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
