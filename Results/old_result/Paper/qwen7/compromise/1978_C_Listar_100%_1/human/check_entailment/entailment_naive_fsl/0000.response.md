Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation with the required Manhattan value, but it does not cover all possible scenarios, particularly when `k` is odd or when `n` is odd and `k` is at the maximum possible value.

### Case Analysis:

1. **Odd `n` and `k` is Odd**: When `n` is odd and `k` is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value is `(n^2 - 1) / 2`, which is an integer. However, the function does not handle this case correctly because it assumes `k` can always be reduced by subtracting `i - 1` from `k`. This assumption fails when `k` is odd and cannot be reduced in the manner assumed.

2. **Odd `n` and `k` is Even**: The function correctly handles the case when `k` is even, but it does not provide a complete solution for constructing the permutation. The function `func_1` returns early when `k` becomes zero, which might not always lead to a valid permutation.

3. **Even `n` and `k` is Even**: The function correctly handles the case when `n` is even and `k` is even, but it does not ensure that the permutation is constructed correctly for all values of `k`.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input `n = 3` and `k = 3`. The maximum possible Manhattan value for `n = 3` is 4, but the program fails to generate a permutation that results in a Manhattan value of 3.

- **Expected Output**: A permutation like `[3, 1, 2]` would give a Manhattan value of 3.
- **Actual Output**: The program does not produce a valid permutation for this case.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases and fails to generate the correct permutation for certain inputs, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
