The function accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer less than the length of the list `l`), `k` (an integer less than the length of the list `l`), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`). It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c-k` in the list `l`. After the swap, the function returns the modified list `l`, which remains a permutation of length `n`.
