Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 3, `n` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `k` and `r` are updated based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, `rem` is `n - 4`, and `y` is `n - 4`. If the condition is true, `k` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, `k` is decreased by 4 times the difference between the element at index 4 and the element at index 3, and `r` is the element at index 4 in list `a`.**
