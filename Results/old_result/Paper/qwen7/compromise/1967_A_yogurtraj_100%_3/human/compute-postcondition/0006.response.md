Output State: **`rem` is 0, `r` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `y` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. Since `y` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
