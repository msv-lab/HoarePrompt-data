Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 1, `ii` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to `a[n-1] + k // n`. Here, `a[n-1]` is the last element of the list `a`, which is equal to `r`. So, `r` is updated to `r + k // n`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii`) remain unchanged.
