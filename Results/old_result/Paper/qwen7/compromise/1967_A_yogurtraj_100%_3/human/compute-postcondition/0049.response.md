Output State: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is the last element of the original list `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `a`. The other variables (`ii`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
