Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `n` is decreased by 1, `r` is updated accordingly, and `rem` and `y` are defined as specified in the if part.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` simplifies to `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. The values of `n`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states, and `k` is adjusted accordingly.
