Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If the condition is true, then `k` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, and `n` remains greater than 0.
