Output State: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), `r` is either `a[0]` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `i + 1` becomes 2. Thus, `k` is reduced by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
