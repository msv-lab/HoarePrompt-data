Output State: **`i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`**

Explanation: The code `r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)` assigns the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression becomes `a[2] + k // 3`. The value of `n` is not affected by this code, and it must still be greater than 0. Therefore, the updated state includes `r` being the sum of the third element of array `a` and `k` divided by 3, while `i` remains 2 and `n` must still be greater than 0.
