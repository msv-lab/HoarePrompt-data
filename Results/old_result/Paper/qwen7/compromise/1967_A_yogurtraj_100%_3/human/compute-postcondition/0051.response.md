Output State: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `r`. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` now holds the smallest value in the list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
