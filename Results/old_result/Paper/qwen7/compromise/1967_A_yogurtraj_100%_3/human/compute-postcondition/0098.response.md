Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to `n-2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, meaning `i` should start from `0` and go up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be `0` because the loop starts at `0`.
   - `n` must be greater than `0` to ensure there are valid iterations from `0` to `n-1`.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `ii`, `a`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to `0` and `n` to be greater than `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
