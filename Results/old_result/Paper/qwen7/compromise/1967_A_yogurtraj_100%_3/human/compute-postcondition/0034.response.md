Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `r` is 0 if `i` is 1, or 0 if `i` is 2; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, which is 0; `y` is `n - 1 - i`**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value `0`. Since `k` was previously involved in the calculation of `r` and `rem`, these values now become `0`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i` based on the initial state.
