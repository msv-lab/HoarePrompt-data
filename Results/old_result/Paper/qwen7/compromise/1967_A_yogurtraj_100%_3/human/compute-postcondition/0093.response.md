Output State: **`ii` is 1, `a` is a list of integers inputted by the user, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either 0 or has been reduced throughout the iterations, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `r` is the last element of the list `a` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was never met, otherwise `r` is the element at the position where the condition was last met, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. This changes the value of `a` to a list of integers, but does not affect the values of the other variables (`ii`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`). Therefore, the output state retains the values of all variables except `a`, which is now updated to the list of integers input by the user.
