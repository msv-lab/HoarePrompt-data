Output State: **`i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + 0 // 3`, `rem` is `0 % 3`, `y` is `n - 1 - 2`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block present in the given code snippet, the variables `i`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` retain their initial values. The `break` statement does not alter these values but indicates that we would exit the current loop or conditional context.
