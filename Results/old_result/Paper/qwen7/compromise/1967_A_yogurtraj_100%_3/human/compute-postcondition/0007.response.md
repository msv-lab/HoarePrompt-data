Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (as per the range function `range(0, n - 1)`).
   - `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` should be 0, and `n` should be at least 2 (since `0 < n - 1` implies `n > 1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `rem`, `r`, `k`, `a`, and `y` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
