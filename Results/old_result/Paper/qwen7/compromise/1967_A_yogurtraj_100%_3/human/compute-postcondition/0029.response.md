Postcondition: **`i` is either 2 or remains 1, `n` is decreased by 1 in both cases, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, and `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]` if the condition is not met. If the condition is met, `i` becomes 2, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `n` is decreased by 1.**
