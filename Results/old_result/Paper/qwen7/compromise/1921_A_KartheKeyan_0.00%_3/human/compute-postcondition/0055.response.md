Output State: `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing three tuples: (1, input integer), (input integer, input integer), (input integer, input integer).

Explanation: The loop runs for 4 iterations as specified by `range(4)`. After all iterations are completed, the value of `i` will be 3 since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. For each iteration, the user inputs two integers `x` and `y`, which are then appended as a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Therefore, after 4 iterations, the list `coord` will contain 4 tuples, but based on the provided output states, we can infer that the first two tuples were already determined in the first two iterations, so the third iteration would add another tuple `(input integer, input integer)` to the list.
