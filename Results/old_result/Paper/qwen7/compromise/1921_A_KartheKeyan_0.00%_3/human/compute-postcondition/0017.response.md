Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]` sorted, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `p1` is `(1 - 0)**2 + (coord[1][1] - 0)**2`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the squared distance between the first two points in the `coord` list, which are `(0, 0)` and `(1, input integer)`. The distance formula used is \((1 - 0)^2 + (coord[1][1] - 0)^2\), which simplifies to \(1 + (coord[1][1])**2\). Since `coord[1][1]` is an input integer, `p1` is set to \(1 + (\text{input integer})^2\). The other variables remain unchanged.
