State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(4):`, which means the loop will iterate over the values of `i` starting from 0 up to but not including 4 (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3).
2. For the loop to start executing, the variable `i` must be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 0.
3. The initial values of `n`, `coord`, and `res` do not affect whether the loop can start executing. They remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `i` is 0.
