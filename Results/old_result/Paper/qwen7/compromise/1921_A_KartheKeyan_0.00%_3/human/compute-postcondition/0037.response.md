Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing four sorted tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 5, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the Euclidean distance squared between the first two points in the `coord` list and assigns it to `p1`. Since the exact coordinates are not given, `p1` is expressed in terms of the coordinates of the first two points in the list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
