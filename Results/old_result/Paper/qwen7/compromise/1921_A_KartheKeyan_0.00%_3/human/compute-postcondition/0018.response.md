Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]` sorted, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is \((x - (x))^2 + (y - y)^2\)**

Explanation:
- The variable `p2` is calculated as the Euclidean distance squared between the last two points in the `coord` list, which are `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`. Since both points are the same, the distance squared is \(0\).
- All other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `p1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
