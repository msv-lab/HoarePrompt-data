Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `coord.append((x, y))` appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` now contains one tuple `(x, y)`. The values of `n` and `res` remain unchanged.
