Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(4):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `n` is 0
   - `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[ (0, 0), (x, y) ]`
   - `res` is 0
   - `i` is 0

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 4.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i`, we need to update `i` to the next value it would take if the loop were to execute again.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition alone. Therefore, they remain the same.

6. **New State**: After adjusting `i` to 1, the new state before the next iteration of the loop should be:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` remains 0
   - `coord` remains `[ (0, 0), (x, y) ]`
   - `res` remains 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[ (0, 0), (x, y) ]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
