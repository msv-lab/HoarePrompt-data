Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is 1 less than its initial value, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for the current value of `l`, and `l` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))
    print(res)
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is -1, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]` sorted, `res` is abs(math.sqrt(1) * math.sqrt((x - (x))^2 + (y - y)^2)), `i` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `res` is 0, `n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four sorted tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 5, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, input integer), (input integer, input integer), (input integer, input integer), (input integer, input integer); `p1` is the sum of squared differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the first two points in `coord`; `p2` is the sum of squared differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the last two points in `coord`; `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
