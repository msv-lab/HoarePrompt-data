Output State: `res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 5, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0.

This output state is calculated based on the given loop which runs from `i` in `range(4)`. Since the loop runs 4 times, `i` will increment from 2 to 5. For each iteration, the coordinates `(x, y)` are appended to the `coord` list. Therefore, after all iterations, `coord` will contain 4 tuples, and `i` will be 5. The other variables (`res`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
