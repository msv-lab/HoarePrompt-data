Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `i` is 3, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, where `(x, y)` is a tuple obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `x` and `y`. This changes the value of `x` and `y` but does not affect the other variables. The list `coord` is updated to contain the new tuple `(x, y)`. All other variables (`res`, `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.
