Output State: `i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (0, input integer), (1, input integer), (2, input integer), (3, input integer).

Explanation: The loop runs 4 times because the `range(4)` generates numbers from 0 to 3. After each iteration, the value of `i` increments by 1. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 4. For each value of `i` from 0 to 3, the user inputs two integers `x` and `y`, which are then appended as a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Hence, `coord` will contain four tuples after the loop completes.
