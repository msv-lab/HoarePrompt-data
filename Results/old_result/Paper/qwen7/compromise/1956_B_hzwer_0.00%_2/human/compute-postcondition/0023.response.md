Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-2`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]` if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
