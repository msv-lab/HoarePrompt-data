Let's break down the task step by step.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `dp` is a 2D list representing the dynamic programming table.
- `n` is the size of the `cards` list plus one (since `range(n-3, -1, -1)` implies `n-1` is the highest index).

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined by the variable `i` in the range `range(n-3, -1, -1)`. This means `i` starts from `n-3` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

### Loop Body
The loop body updates the `dp` table based on the conditions provided:
- If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be set to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `dp` is updated according to the conditions mentioned above.
- `i` is currently at its lowest value, which is `-1`.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `0`. The `dp` table will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

### Adjusted States
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `0`.
- `dp` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`dp` is updated according to the conditions provided for `i = 0`, `i` is 0**.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`dp` is updated according to the conditions provided for `i = 0`, `i` is 0**.
