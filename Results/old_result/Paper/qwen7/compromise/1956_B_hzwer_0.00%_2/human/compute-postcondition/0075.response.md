Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `j + 1` in `cards` appears exactly once.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` using the maximum of two expressions: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, or the condition related to `cards`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged except for the increment of `i` and the calculation of `dp[i][j]`.
