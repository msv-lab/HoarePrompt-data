Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The other variables (`total`, `students_list`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
