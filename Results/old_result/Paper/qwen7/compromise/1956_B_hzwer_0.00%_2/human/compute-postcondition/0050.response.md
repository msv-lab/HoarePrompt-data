Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over `j` from `n-1` to `0`. The loop head variables are `j`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition given is about the calculation of `dp[i][j]` based on the value of `j` and the contents of `cards`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - The variable `j` is being decremented in each iteration (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the valid range (i.e., `0` to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `n-2`.

5. **Maintain other relevant states**:
   - The state of `dp[i][j]` is calculated based on the value of `j` and the contents of `cards`, but since the question asks to focus on the loop head variables, we don't need to explicitly state changes to `dp[i][j]` here.

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - Since `j` is being decremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `n-2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`dp[i][j]` is calculated as follows: if the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, with the condition that `j` is `n-2`.**
