Postcondition: **`dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `j + 1` in `cards` appears exactly once, otherwise `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is not equal to 0.**
