Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it. The precondition that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 is still valid.
