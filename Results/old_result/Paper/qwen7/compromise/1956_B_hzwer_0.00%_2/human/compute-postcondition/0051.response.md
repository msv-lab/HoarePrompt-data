Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`**.

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`. The conditions for calculating `dp[i][j]` involving the count of `j + 1` in `cards` and the maximum values have not been applied because the code only assigns `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
