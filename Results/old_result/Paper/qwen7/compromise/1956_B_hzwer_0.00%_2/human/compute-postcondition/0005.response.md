Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being initialized and updated within the loop.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-3` to `-1` in reverse order. This means `i` will take values starting from `n-3` down to `0`.

3. **Initial state of `i`**: From the given state, we know that `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0. However, this information is not directly related to the loop initialization or condition. We need to focus on the initial value of `i` at the start of the loop.

4. **Adjusting the state**: Since the loop starts with `i = n-3`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `n-3` at the beginning of the loop. No other adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute based on the provided information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is `n-3`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1)**
