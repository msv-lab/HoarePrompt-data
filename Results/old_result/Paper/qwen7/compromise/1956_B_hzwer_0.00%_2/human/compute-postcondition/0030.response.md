Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n - 3`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to either `dp[i + 1][j]` if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, or to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `j + 1` appears in `cards`.
