Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- We need to determine the state of the variables involved in the loop head for the next iteration.
- The loop variable `i` is being decremented by 1 in each iteration, starting from `n-3` down to `0`.

### Loop Head Variables
- `i`: This is the loop variable itself.
- No other variables are mentioned in the loop head that would be directly modified or checked within the loop body (other than `i`).

### Current State
- At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` is some value, say `k` (where `k` is between `n-4` and `0`).

### Next Iteration
- For the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be greater than or equal to `-1` (since the loop starts at `n-3` and goes down to `0`).

### Adjusting the State
- Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we need to update it to `k - 1`.
- The value of `i` must be such that the loop can continue, i.e., `i >= -1`.

### Final State
- If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

### Example Adjustment
- If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2` (which means `k = 2`), then for the next iteration, `i` will be `1`.

### General Adjustment
- If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

### Conclusion
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `k - 1`**, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `k` was `2`, then `i` will be `1`.

In a general form:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`** (where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
