Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `cards` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1).**

Explanation: The code initializes a 2D list `dp` where each inner list contains `n + 1` zeros. The dimensions of `dp` are `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` remains as a list of integers.
