Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or any value up to `n-1`, `t` is a positive integer that can be incremented, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user via `map(int, input().split())`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The values of `cnt`, `t`, `a`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
