Output State: **`_` is t, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The variables `_` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
