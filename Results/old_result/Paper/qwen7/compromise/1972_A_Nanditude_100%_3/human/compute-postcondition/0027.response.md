Output State: `cnt` is either 0, 1, or any value up to `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. The variable `j` will also be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs through `range(n)`, meaning `j` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. The value of `cnt` can range from 0 to `n-1` because each time `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is incremented. However, since `i` eventually becomes `n`, no further increments to `cnt` can occur, making the maximum value of `cnt` `n-1`.
