Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial Information:
- The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`.
- This means the loop will run `t` times.
- There are no specific variables mentioned in the loop head other than the loop counter `_`.

### Loop Execution:
- The loop runs from 0 to `t-1`.
- Since there are no specific variables in the loop head, the only thing that changes with each iteration is the loop counter `_`.

### State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- The state does not provide any specific values for variables inside the loop, but it tells us that the loop has completed one full iteration.

### Next Iteration:
- Since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(t)`, the loop counter `_` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the loop counter `_` would have been `t-1`.
- For the next iteration, the loop counter `_` will become `t`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is the loop counter `_`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`_` is t**
