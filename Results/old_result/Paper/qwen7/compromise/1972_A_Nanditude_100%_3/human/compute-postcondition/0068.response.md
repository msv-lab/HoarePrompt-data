Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (given as a postcondition).
   - The loop body increases `cnt` if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise it increases `i` by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs as long as `j < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, `j` will be `previous_j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `n`, so `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `j < n`, and `j` is about to be incremented.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `previous_j + 1`, and `n` remains unchanged**.
