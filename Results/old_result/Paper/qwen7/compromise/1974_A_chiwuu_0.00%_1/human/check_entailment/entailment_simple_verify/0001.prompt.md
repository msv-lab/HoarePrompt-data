You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates `t = b * 2`. This represents the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, it means that the number of cells is exactly divisible by 5, so it sets `t` to `t // 5`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `t` to `t // 5 + 1`, which accounts for any remainder when dividing by 5.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - It calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, it means there are enough remaining cells to place all 1x1 icons, so it sets `t` to `t`.

4. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `t1 < a`, it calculates `t2 = a - t1`, which is the number of additional cells needed for 1x1 icons.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, it means the number of additional cells is exactly divisible by 15, so it adds `t2 // 15` to `t`.
   - Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` to `t`, accounting for any remainder when dividing by 15.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `t`, which is the minimum number of screens needed.

   - Program Output: `0`

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Two 1x1 icons. One screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1`

    - Expected Output: `2`
    - Explanation: Two 2x2 icons (8 cells) and eight 1x1 icons. Two screens are needed.
    - Program Output: `2`

11. **Test Case 11:**
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Expected Output: `3`
    - Explanation: Nine 1x1 icons. Three screens are needed.
    - Program Output: `5`

### Conclusion

The program does not produce the expected output for Test Case 11. Specifically, it outputs `5` instead of `3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
