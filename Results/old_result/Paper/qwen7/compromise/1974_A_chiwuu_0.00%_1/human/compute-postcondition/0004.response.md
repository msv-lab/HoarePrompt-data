Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers t, x, and y. For each test case, t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and x and y are non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 99. The function returns different outputs based on the values of x and y for each test case.**

However, since the specific output logic based on x and y is not provided, the functionality can be described as processing multiple test cases with the given constraints and returning outputs accordingly for each case.
