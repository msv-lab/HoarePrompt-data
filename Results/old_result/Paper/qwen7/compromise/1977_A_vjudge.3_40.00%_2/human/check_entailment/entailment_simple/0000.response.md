Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking the conditions to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, there are some logical flaws in the conditions used to decide whether it's possible to achieve `m` cubes:

1. **Condition `n == m`:** This correctly identifies that if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible.
2. **Condition `m > n`:** This is incorrect because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.
3. **Condition `m == n - 1`:** This condition is not necessary because it's covered by the previous condition `n == m`. If `m == n - 1`, it means that after `n` moves, we removed one cube, which is equivalent to having `n` moves but ending up with `n-1` cubes, which is already covered by `n == m`.
4. **Conditions involving even/odd checks:** These conditions are overly complex and unnecessary. The key point is whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even or odd, not their individual parities.

Given these points, the correct logic should be:
- If `n == m`, print "Yes".
- If `m > n`, print "No".
- Otherwise, check if `(n - m)` is even. If it is, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

The provided solution does not cover all cases correctly and includes unnecessary complexity. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
