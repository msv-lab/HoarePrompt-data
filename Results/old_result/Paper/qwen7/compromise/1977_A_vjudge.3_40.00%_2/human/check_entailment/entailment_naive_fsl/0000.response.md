Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, Nikita can only end up with a tower of `m` cubes if the parity (odd or even nature) of `m` and `n` matches. However, the current implementation does not account for this properly.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `m = 3`. Here, `n` is even and `m` is odd, which should result in "No" according to the problem description. However, the program incorrectly prints "Yes" in this case because it only checks for specific conditions like `m == n - 1` or both being even/odd without considering the general parity check.
