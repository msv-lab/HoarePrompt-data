Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to the maximum value in `a`. If they are, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If only one of them is equal to the maximum value, it prints 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' accordingly.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then iterates through `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players.
     - For Bodya, it checks if `foundb` is true. If not, it updates `b` with the current score and moves to the next position in the permutation.
     - Similarly, for Sasha, it checks if `founds` is true. If not, it updates `s` with the current score and moves to the next position in the permutation.
   - After the loop, it calculates the total scores for both players using the accumulated scores and the remaining turns.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the final scores for both players using the accumulated scores and the remaining turns.
   - It then compares the final scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Game Simulation**:
   - The logic for simulating the game is flawed. The program assumes that the players will always choose the maximum value in `a` for their scores, which is not necessarily true. The players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation, and their strategy might depend on the values in `a` and the positions they are at.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Game Strategy**:
   - The program does not account for the optimal strategy of the players. It assumes that the players will always choose the maximum value in `a` for their scores, which might not be the case. The players can strategically choose to stay or move based on the values in `a` and the positions they are at.

3. **Incorrect Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final score calculation is based on the assumption that the players will always choose the maximum value in `a` for their scores, which is not necessarily true. The players can choose to stay or move based on the values in `a` and the positions they are at.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the logic for simulating the game and calculating the final scores, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
