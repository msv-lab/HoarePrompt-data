Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` and `founds` are True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `foundb`, `founds`, `b`, and `s`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement the program is currently inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
