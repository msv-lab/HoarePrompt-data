Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`; `s` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `b`. The initial state of `b` contains one element, which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. After appending `maxa`, `b` now contains two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.
