Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 0, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the elements `(k - 1) * maxa` and optionally `a[pb - 1]` depending on the condition, `s` contains the element `(k - 2) * maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, and `foundb` is False, assuming `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`.
