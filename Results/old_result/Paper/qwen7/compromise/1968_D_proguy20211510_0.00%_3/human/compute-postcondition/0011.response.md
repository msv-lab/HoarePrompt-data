Based on the initial state provided:

- `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integer values derived from strings.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `p`.
- The last elements of the lists indexed by `pb-1` and `ps-1` are equal to the maximum value in the list `p`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'` to the console. There are no variables or objects being evaluated or referenced within this statement; it is a direct print of the string literal.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Draw**
