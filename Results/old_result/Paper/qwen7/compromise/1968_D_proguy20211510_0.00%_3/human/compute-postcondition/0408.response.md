Postcondition: `i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` now contains the value `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`, `pb` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` now contains `s + [a[ps - 1]]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `s + [maxa]` or `s + [a[ps - 1]]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
