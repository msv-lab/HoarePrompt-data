Output State: **`i` is 4; `rem` is `k - i - 1`; `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + preb[3] + (k - 4) * b[3] + preb[4] + (k - 5) * b[4] + preb[4] + rem * b[4]`; `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1] + pres[3] + (k - 4) * s[3] + pres[4] + (k - 5) * s[4]`; `ptss` now includes the element `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. This new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `i` is 4. So, the new element added to `ptss` is `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`. The values of `i`, `rem`, `ptsb`, and the structure of `ptss` remain unchanged except for the addition of the new element.
