Output State: **`rem` is `k - i - 1`, `i` is 3, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`**

Explanation: The variable `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - i - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
