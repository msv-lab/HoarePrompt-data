Postcondition: **`i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` now contains the value `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`, `pb` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` now contains `s + [a[ps - 1]]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `founds` remains True, `b` includes `[a[pb - 1]]`, and `s` includes `[a[ps - 1]]`. Otherwise, `b` includes `[maxa]` and `s` includes `[maxa]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`. In both cases, `ps` and `pb` are updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `p[ps - 1]` respectively, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
