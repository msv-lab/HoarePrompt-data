Output State: **`i` is 2; `rem` is `k - 1`; `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`; `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptss`. This value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so now `i` is incremented to 2. `rem` remains unchanged as `k - 1`. The value of `ptsb` is not affected by this line of code. The new value added to `ptss` is `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
