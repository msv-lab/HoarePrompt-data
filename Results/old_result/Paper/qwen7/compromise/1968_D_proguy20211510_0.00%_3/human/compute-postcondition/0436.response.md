Output State: **`rem` is `k - 1`, `i` is 2, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptss`. This value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `i` is currently 1 (after the first iteration, it would be 2), `rem` is `k - 1`, and `s[i]` is `s[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
