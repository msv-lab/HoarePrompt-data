Output State: **`founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list.**

The code simply initializes two boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` to `False`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged.
