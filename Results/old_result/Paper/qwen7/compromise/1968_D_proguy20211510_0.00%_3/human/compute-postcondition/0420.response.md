Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i]` and `sb + b[i] + b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing the value `ss + s[i]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**

Explanation: The code appends `sb + b[i] + b[i]` to the list `preb`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 again, making it `i_prev + 2`.
