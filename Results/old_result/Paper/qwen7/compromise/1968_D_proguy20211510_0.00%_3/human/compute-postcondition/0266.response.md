Output State: **`preb` has had its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is now equal to `sb + b[i]`, `pres` has the new element `ss + s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. The values of `preb` and `sb` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `preb` still has its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is still equal to `sb + b[i]`, and `pres` now includes the new element `ss + s[i]`.
