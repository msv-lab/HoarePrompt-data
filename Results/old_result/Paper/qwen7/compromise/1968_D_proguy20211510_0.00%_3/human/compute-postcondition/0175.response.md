Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the length of the list `pres`.
- `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`.
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer.
- `pb` is an integer.
- `ps` is an integer.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

The `print('Draw')` statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
