Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(pres)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(pres)`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `rem` is `k - i - 1`
   - `i` is 3
   - `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + preb[3] + (k - i - 1) * b[3]`
   - `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`
   - `ptss` now includes the value `pres[3] + rem * s[3]`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(pres)`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` should be less than `len(pres)`. Since `i` is now 4, `len(pres)` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `rem` remains unchanged as it is dependent on `i` and `k`, but since `i` changes, `rem` will change accordingly.
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `ptsb` and `ptss` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`rem` is `k - 4 - 1`, `i` is 4, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + preb[4] + (k - 4 - 1) * b[4]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`, and `ptss` now includes the value `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`.**
