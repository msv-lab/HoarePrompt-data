Output State: **`founds` is True, `i` is either 4 or 2, `k` is greater than `i + 1`, `b` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` depending on whether `foundb` is true or false, `s` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`, `foundb` is True if `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially `[ (k - (i + 1)) * maxa ]`, after appending `a[ps - 1]`, `s` becomes `[ (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1] ]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
