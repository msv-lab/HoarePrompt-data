Output State: **`b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value of the original `n` string, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `pb` is an integer value of the original `pb` string, `ps` is an integer value of the original `ps` string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `p`, `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are checked against `maxa`, and `founds` and `foundb` are set to `False`.**

This code initializes two boolean variables, `founds` and `foundb`, to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
