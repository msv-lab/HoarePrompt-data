Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` now contains the value `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]], `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` contains the value `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since `b` was previously `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]`, after appending `a[pb - 1]`, `b` becomes `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `k`, `foundb`, `founds`, `maxa`, `s`, `ps`, `pb`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
