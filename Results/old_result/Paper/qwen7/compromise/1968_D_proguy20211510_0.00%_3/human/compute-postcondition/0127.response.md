Output State: **`preb` is a list containing one element which is `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing one element which is `ss + s[i]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`, `s` must be a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by the value of `s[i]`. The other variables (`preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
