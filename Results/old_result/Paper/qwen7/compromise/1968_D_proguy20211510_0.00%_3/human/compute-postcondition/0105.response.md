Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`; `s` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`; `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `pb` is assigned the value of `p[pb - 1]`. Since `pb` was previously defined, its new value is now `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or values from the initial state.
