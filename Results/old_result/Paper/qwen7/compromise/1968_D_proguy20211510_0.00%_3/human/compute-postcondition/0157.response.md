Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(pres)`.
- `rem` is equal to `k - len(pres) - 1`.
- `ptsb` is a list where each element is calculated as `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `ptss` is a list where each element is calculated as `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- It is also given that the current value of `maxs` is greater than the current value of `maxb`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string "Sasha".

Output: **Sasha**
