Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` now contains the value `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [maxa]` or `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` now contains `s + [maxa]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `s + [a[ps - 1]]`, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, and `s` appends `a[ps - 1]`.**

In more detail, the code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
