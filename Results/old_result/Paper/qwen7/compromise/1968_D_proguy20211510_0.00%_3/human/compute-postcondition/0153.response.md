Output State: `i` is `len(pres)` - 1; `rem` is `k - (len(pres) - 1)`; `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres) - 1`; `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(pres) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of `pres` minus one, and `rem` will be equal to `k - (length of pres - 1)`. The list `ptsb` will contain the sum of `preb[i]` plus `(k - i - 1) * b[i]` for every index `i` from 0 up to the last index processed by the loop. Similarly, the list `ptss` will contain the sum of `pres[i]` plus `(k - i - 1) * s[i]` for every index `i` starting from 1 up to the last index processed by the loop.
