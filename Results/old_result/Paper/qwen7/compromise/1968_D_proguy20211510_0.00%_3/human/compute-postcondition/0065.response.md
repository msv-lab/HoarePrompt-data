Output State: **`i` is 2 or 0, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the elements `(k - 1) * maxa`, `s` contains the element `(k - 2) * maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `foundb` is False or `founds` is True, and `a[ps - 1] != maxa`; `s` now contains the element `(k - 2) * maxa` followed by `a[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally contained the element `(k - 2) * maxa`, after appending `a[ps - 1]`, `s` now contains `(k - 2) * maxa` followed by `a[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
