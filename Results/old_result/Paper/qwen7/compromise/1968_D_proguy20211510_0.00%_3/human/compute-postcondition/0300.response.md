Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(pres)`, meaning `i` is the length of the list `pres`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `ptsb` is the sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `len(pres)-1`.
- `ptss` is the sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `len(pres)-1`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- The condition `maxs < maxb` is true, meaning `maxb` is greater than `maxs`.

The `print('Bodya')` statement simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
