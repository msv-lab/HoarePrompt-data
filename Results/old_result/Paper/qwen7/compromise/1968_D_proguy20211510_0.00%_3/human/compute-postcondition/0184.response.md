Postcondition: `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), and `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, then no changes are made to the variables.
