Output State: **`preb` has its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is now equal to `sb + b[i]`, `pres` has the new element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is now equal to `ss + s[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `preb` has a new element `sb + b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. This means that `preb` gains a new element which is the sum of `sb` and `b[i]`. All other variables (`sb`, `pres`, `ss`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
