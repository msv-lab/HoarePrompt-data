Output State: **`preb` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`, the second element is `sb + b[i+1]`, and the third element is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `pres` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `ss + s[i+2]`, the second element is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1]`, and the third element is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1] + s[i]`; `sb` is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `ss` is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1]`.**

Explanation: The code `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Initially, `pres` contains two elements: `ss + s[i+2]` and `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1]`. After appending `ss + s[i]`, `pres` now contains three elements: `ss + s[i+2]`, `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1]`, and `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1] + s[i]`. All other variables (`preb`, `sb`, and `ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
