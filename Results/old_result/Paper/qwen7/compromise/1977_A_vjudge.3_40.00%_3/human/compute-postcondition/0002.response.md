Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' and 'No' based on the conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the values of `n` and `m` are read from user input, and depending on their values, either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' will depend on the specific inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
