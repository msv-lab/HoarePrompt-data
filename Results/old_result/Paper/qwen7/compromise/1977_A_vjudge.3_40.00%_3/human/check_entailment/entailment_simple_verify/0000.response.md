### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated code and the provided examples.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions for Printing "Yes":**
   - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes". This means the number of moves equals the number of cubes, which is a valid scenario.
   - If `m > n`, it prints "No". This is because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes". This means the last move was a removal, which is valid.
   - If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, it prints "Yes". This means both `m` and `n` are even, which is a valid scenario.
   - If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, it prints "Yes". This means both `m` and `n` are odd, which is also a valid scenario.

3. **Conditions for Printing "No":**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

Now, let's consider the edge cases mentioned in the original assessment:

- **Case: `n = 4` and `m = 3`**
  - The program checks `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` separately.
  - Since `m` is odd and `n` is even, the program would check `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`, which is false.
  - It would then check `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`, which is also false.
  - Therefore, it prints "No", which is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the program correctly handles the case where `m` and `n` have different parities. We should combine the conditions for even and odd parities into a single check.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0) or (n % 2 != 0 and m % 2 != 0):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Final Evaluation:

After analyzing the program and the corrected version, we can see that the original assessment was accurate. The program indeed fails to handle the case where `m` and `n` have different parities correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
