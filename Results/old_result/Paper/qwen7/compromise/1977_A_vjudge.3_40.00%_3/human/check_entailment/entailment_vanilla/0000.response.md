Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Parsing Test Case Inputs:**
   - For each test case, it correctly parses the values of `n` and `m`.

3. **Conditions for Printing "Yes":**
   - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes". This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - If `m > n`, it prints "No". This is also correct because Nikita cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves he makes.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes". This is correct because Nikita can add one cube per move and remove one cube at the end.
   - The condition `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` checks if both `n` and `m` are even. This is not necessarily correct. For example, if `n = 4` and `m = 2`, Nikita can add 2 cubes and remove 2 cubes, ending up with 2 cubes. However, this condition alone is insufficient.
   - The condition `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` checks if both `n` and `m` are odd. This is not necessarily correct either. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, Nikita can add 3 cubes and remove 2 cubes, ending up with 3 cubes. Again, this condition alone is insufficient.

4. **Conditions for Printing "No":**
   - The remaining cases are handled by printing "No". These conditions seem to cover all other scenarios where `m` cannot be achieved from `n` moves.

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the conditions for printing "Yes" are incomplete and may miss some valid scenarios. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 4`, Nikita can add 4 cubes and remove 1 cube, but the current logic would incorrectly print "No".

### Corrected Program:

To ensure the program works correctly, we need to consider all valid scenarios. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m < n:
            # Check if the difference between n and m is even
            if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
                print('Yes')
            else:
                print('No')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Final Answer:

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
