### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The problem involves determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube.
- Valid inputs: `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- It checks specific conditions and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on those conditions.
- Conditions include:
  - `n == m`: Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
  - `m > n`: Nikita cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
  - `m == n - 1`: Nikita can add one cube per move and remove one cube at the end.
  - `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`: Both `n` and `m` are even.
  - `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`: Both `n` and `m` are odd.
  - Default case: Prints "No".

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The conditions `n == m`, `m > n`, and `m == n - 1` are correct.
   - However, the conditions `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` are not sufficient. They do not cover all valid scenarios.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key insight is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, which means the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes remains consistent with the parity of the number of moves.

3. **Corrected Conditions:**
   - If `n == m`, print "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, print "No".
   - If `m < n`, check if `(n - m)` is even. If it is, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".
   - If `m == n`, print "Yes".

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m < n:
            if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
                print('Yes')
            else:
                print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the corrected analysis, the original program is incorrect because it misses the key condition that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even. The corrected program handles all valid scenarios correctly.

Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to missing the key condition that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even.
