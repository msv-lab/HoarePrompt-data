You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' and 'No' responses based on the conditions evaluated in the loop for each pair of integers (n, m) entered. Specifically, 'Yes' is printed if n equals m, if m is greater than n, if m is one less than n, or if both n and m are even or both are odd. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' depends on the input pairs provided during the loop's execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Parsing Test Case Inputs:**
   - For each test case, it correctly parses the values of `n` and `m`.

3. **Conditions for Printing "Yes":**
   - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes". This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - If `m > n`, it prints "No". This is also correct because Nikita cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves he makes.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes". This is correct because Nikita can add one cube per move and remove one cube at the end.
   - The condition `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` checks if both `n` and `m` are even. This is not necessarily correct. For example, if `n = 4` and `m = 2`, Nikita can add 2 cubes and remove 2 cubes, ending up with 2 cubes. However, this condition alone is insufficient.
   - The condition `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` checks if both `n` and `m` are odd. This is not necessarily correct either. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, Nikita can add 3 cubes and remove 2 cubes, ending up with 3 cubes. Again, this condition alone is insufficient.

4. **Conditions for Printing "No":**
   - The remaining cases are handled by printing "No". These conditions seem to cover all other scenarios where `m` cannot be achieved from `n` moves.

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the conditions for printing "Yes" are incomplete and may miss some valid scenarios. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 4`, Nikita can add 4 cubes and remove 1 cube, but the current logic would incorrectly print "No".

### Corrected Program:

To ensure the program works correctly, we need to consider all valid scenarios. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m < n:
            # Check if the difference between n and m is even
            if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
                print('Yes')
            else:
                print('No')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Final Answer:

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
