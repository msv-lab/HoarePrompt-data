Reasoning:  
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to generate a k-level permutation for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `permutation` of size `n`.
   - It sets up three variables: `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` to manage the construction of the permutation.
   - It iterates `k` times, setting every `k`-th element starting from index `k` to `i + 1`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `k-1`.
   - After the loop, it constructs a string representation of the permutation and prints it.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, `t` becomes non-positive (0 or negative).

Given the problem statement and the provided annotations, the program correctly processes each test case by generating a k-level permutation and printing it. The logic ensures that the generated permutation satisfies the conditions of a k-level permutation as defined in the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
