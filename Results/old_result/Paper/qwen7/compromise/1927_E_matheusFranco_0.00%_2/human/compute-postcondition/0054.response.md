Output State: `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 1, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1` for all iterations `i` from 0 to `k-1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `curr_v` is `n * k + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `permutation` list will have its elements set according to the rule specified in the loop body, with every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) being set to `i + 1`. The loop runs for `k` iterations, and during each iteration, `curr_v` is incremented by `k` each time `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated. Since the loop increments `curr_v` by 1 each time through the loop and there are `k` iterations, `curr_v` will be `k + 1` at the end of the first iteration, `2 * k + 1` at the end of the second iteration, and so on, up to `k * k + 1` at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, `curr_v` will be `n * k + 1` when the loop finishes. All other variables (`idx`, `idx_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) will be as described.
