Output State: All elements in `permutation` from index `i` to `i + (n-1)*k` (where `n` is the number of iterations the loop executes) are replaced by consecutive integers starting from `i`. The variable `curr_v` will be equal to `i + n*k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `i + n*k`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the `permutation` list will have its elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+(n-1)*k` replaced with consecutive integers starting from `i`. The value of `curr_v` will be incremented by `n` (the number of iterations), and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will also be equal to `i + n*k`.
