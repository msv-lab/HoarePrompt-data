Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 14, `permutation` has its `multiples_of_k_plus_i` index updated with `curr_v` + 1, `curr_v` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The initial state is `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 7, `permutation` has its `multiples_of_k_plus_i` index updated with `curr_v` + 1, and `curr_v` is increased by 1. The code `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by the value of `k`. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we assume `k` is a constant that was previously set to 7 (as the initial value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 7). Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes 14. The other variables remain unchanged as no further operations are performed on them.
