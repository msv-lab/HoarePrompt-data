Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `2 * 2`-th element (starting from 2) is set to `2 + 1`, `curr_v` is 5, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, and the second element of `permutation` is now 5.**

Explanation: The code updates the `permutation` list by setting the element at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to `curr_v`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2 and `curr_v` is 5, the second element of the `permutation` list is updated to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
