Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is increased by 2, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `curr_v += 1` increments the value of `curr_v` by 1. Given that `curr_v` was previously increased by 1 (from the initial state), it is now increased by 2 in total. The other conditions and updates remain unchanged.
