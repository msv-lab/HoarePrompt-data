Output State: `t` is a non-positive integer.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will no longer be a positive integer. Since the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration and stops when `t` is no longer greater than 0, `t` will eventually reach 0 or become negative, making it a non-positive integer.
