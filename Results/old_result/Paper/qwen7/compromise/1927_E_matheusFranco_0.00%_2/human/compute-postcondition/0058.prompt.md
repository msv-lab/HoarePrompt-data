You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is even, and n - k + 1 ≥ 1.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: Output State: `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 1, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1` for all iterations `i` from 0 to `k-1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `curr_v` is `n * k + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `permutation` list will have its elements set according to the rule specified in the loop body, with every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) being set to `i + 1`. The loop runs for `k` iterations, and during each iteration, `curr_v` is incremented by `k` each time `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated. Since the loop increments `curr_v` by 1 each time through the loop and there are `k` iterations, `curr_v` will be `k + 1` at the end of the first iteration, `2 * k + 1` at the end of the second iteration, and so on, up to `k * k + 1` at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, `curr_v` will be `n * k + 1` when the loop finishes. All other variables (`idx`, `idx_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) will be as described.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: "1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 ..." (where the exact numbers depend on the values of n and k)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
