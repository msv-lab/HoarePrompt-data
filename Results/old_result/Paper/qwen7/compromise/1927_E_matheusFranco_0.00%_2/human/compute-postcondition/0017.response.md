Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated to ensure it is less than `len(permutation) - k` and then incremented by `k`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`; `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`.**

This means that `curr_v` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states, with `multiples_of_k_plus_i` being adjusted to be less than `len(permutation) - k` and then incremented by `k`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` being set to the new value of `curr_v`.
