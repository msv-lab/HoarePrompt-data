The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 7.
- `len(permutation)` is `n`, and since `permutation` is a list of `n` elements, `len(permutation)` is `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently 7, `n` must be greater than 7.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 7, `n` must be greater than 7**
