Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to `curr_v`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must still be less than `len(permutation)`, `i` must still be less than `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is increased by 1 from its previous state, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now set to the new value of `curr_v`.
