Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1`, `curr_v` is 5, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_i = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
