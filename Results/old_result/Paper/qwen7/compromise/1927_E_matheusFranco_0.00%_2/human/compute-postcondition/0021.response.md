Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `k-1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < k`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `idx` is 1
   - `idx_v` is 4
   - `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1`
   - `n` is an integer input from the user
   - `k` is an integer input from the user
   - `curr_v` is 4
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < k`, and `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.
   - `idx` and `idx_v` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `permutation` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `curr_v` will be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will still be greater than or equal to `len(permutation)` since it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be 2
   - `k` remains the same
   - `idx` remains 1
   - `idx_v` remains 4
   - `permutation` remains unchanged
   - `curr_v` will be 5
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the same, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1`, `curr_v` is 5, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`**.
