Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents a multiplier \(k_i\), and the length of the list is between 1 and 50, inclusive, with each \(k_i\) ranging from 2 to 20. The function returns the result of applying the `func_1` function three times successively to the initial `result` and the first four elements of the `numbers` list.**
