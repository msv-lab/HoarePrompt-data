Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers named `numbers`, where each integer represents a multiplier \(k_i\). It returns the result of applying the `func_1` function three times successively to the initial `result` (which is set to the first element of `numbers`) and the next three elements of the list. If `numbers` has fewer than four elements, the function still returns the cumulative result of applying `func_1` up to the available elements.**
