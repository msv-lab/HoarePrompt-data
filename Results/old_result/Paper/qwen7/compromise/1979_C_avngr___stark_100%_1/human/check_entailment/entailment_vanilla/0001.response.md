Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, we receive \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) coins.
   - We need to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - `func_2(numbers)` computes the LCM of a list of numbers using `func_1`.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - To ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the sum of bets is less than the minimum \(k_i \times x_i\).
   - A simple approach is to set each \(x_i\) to 1, because \(1 < k_i \times 1\) for all \(k_i \geq 2\).

4. **Implementation Check:**
   - The functions provided (`func_1` and `func_2`) are used to compute the LCM, which is not directly relevant to solving the problem as described.
   - The logic in the main part of the program should simply output 1 for each outcome if a solution exists.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - If \(x_i = 1\) for all \(i\), then \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = n\).
   - Since \(k_i \geq 2\), \(k_i \times 1 = k_i > n\) for \(n \leq 50\).
   - Therefore, the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as intended. It uses unnecessary functions to compute the LCM, which is not required for the solution. The correct approach is to simply output 1 for each outcome if a solution exists.

**Correctness: **False**
