Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires distributing coins in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The given functions seem to be related to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, which is not necessary for solving this specific problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that for each \(i\), the condition \(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n < k_i \cdot x_i\) holds. A simple approach is to set each \(x_i = 1\). This ensures that the total bet is \(n\), and since \(k_i \geq 2\), \(k_i \cdot x_i = k_i \geq 2 > n\) for \(n \leq 50\).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def distribute_coins(n, multipliers):
    # Distribute 1 coin on each outcome
    bets = [1] * n
    # Check if the condition is satisfied for each outcome
    for i in range(n):
        if sum(bets) >= multipliers[i] * bets[i]:
            return [-1]
    return bets

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    multipliers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = distribute_coins(n, multipliers)
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This code correctly implements the logic to distribute coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
