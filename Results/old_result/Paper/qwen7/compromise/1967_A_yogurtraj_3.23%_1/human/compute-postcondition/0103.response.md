Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, the expression ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) is greater than `k`, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, and the expression involving them) remain unchanged. The new value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`, which simplifies to `n - 2` given the updated value of `i`.
