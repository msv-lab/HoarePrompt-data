Postcondition: **`y` is either `n - 1 - ii` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `0` otherwise. `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated to the original value of `k` minus `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])` if the condition is false, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is the second element of list `a`, and `rem` is `0`.**
