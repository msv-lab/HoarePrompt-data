Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head for the given `for` loop is `for i in range(0, n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was previously some value, it will now be that value plus 1.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` after the increment.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `k`, `rem`, and `y` are not directly affected by the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` remains the same, `k` is either decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if the condition is false, or `k` becomes 0 if the condition is true, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the relevant adjustment is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same**.
