Output State: **`y` is `n - 1 - ii`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is equal to `a[ii] + k // (ii + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (ii + 1)`, and the value of `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The line `k = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `k`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions specified in the initial state.
