Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - The postcondition includes conditions based on the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` compared to `k`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n - 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `i`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

6. **New State:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
