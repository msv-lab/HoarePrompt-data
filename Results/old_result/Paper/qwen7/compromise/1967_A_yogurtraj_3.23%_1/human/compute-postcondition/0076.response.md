Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)'; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % (i + 1)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `r` is calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The initial state of `r` and `k` remains unchanged in terms of their expressions, but `i` and `rem` are updated according to the given operations.
