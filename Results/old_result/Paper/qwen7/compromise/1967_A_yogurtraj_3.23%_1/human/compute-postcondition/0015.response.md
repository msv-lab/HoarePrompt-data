Output State: **`y` is 0, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the original value of `k` minus `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])`, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is equal to the first element of list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. Since the exact value of `k` was not specified initially, we express the new value of `k` in terms of its original value and the subtraction performed.
