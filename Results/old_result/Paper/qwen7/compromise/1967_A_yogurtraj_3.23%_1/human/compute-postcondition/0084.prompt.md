Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 0, `ii` is the new value obtained from `int(input())`, `n` is now an integer equal to the input integer, `k` is now an integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `r` is equal to `a[0]`, `rem` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is true, then `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `k` is either decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if the condition is false, or `k` becomes 0 if the condition is true, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken if `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false. If the condition is true, then `r` is set to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
