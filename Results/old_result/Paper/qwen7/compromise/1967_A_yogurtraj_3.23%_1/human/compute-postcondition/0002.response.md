Output State: **`ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
