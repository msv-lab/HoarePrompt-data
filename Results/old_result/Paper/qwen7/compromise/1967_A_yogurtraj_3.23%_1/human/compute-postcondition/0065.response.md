Output State: **`r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `n` is the same.**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` and stores it in `rem`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `r` retains its previous value which is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`.
