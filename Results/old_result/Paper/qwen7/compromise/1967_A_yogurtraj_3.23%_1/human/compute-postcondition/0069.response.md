Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` from its current value. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
