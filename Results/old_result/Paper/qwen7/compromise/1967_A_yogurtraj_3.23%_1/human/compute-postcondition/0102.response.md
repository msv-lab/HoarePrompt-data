Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, the expression ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) is greater than `k`, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0.
- The condition `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
- The expression `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))` is still greater than `k`.
- The variable `r` remains unchanged and is still `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`.
- The new variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, so `rem` is `k % 1`, which is 0.
