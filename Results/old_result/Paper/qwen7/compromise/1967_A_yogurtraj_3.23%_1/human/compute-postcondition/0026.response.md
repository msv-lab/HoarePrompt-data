Output State: **`k` is updated to the original value of `k` minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is now `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i + 1` would be `n`, and `a[i + 1]` refers to the element at index `n` in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
