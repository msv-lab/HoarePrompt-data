Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `c`. It then determines the frequency of each unique number in the list `c` and checks if the highest frequency is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`. The function outputs a series of integers based on these conditions for each test case.**
