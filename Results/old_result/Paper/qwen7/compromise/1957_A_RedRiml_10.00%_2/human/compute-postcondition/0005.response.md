Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, or `pl`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new dictionary `d` is introduced with no initial key-value pairs.
