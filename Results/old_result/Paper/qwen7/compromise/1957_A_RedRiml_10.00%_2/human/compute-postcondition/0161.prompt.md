You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: Output State: `shapes` is the total count of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times across all iterations, `palka` remains an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with updated counts of each element in `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `shapes` will hold the cumulative count of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times. The list `palka` remains empty because the loop does not add any elements to it. The dictionary `d` will have updated counts of each element based on their occurrences across all iterations. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, as no elements are added or removed from `pl` during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of subsequent test cases, followed by t sets of inputs. Each set contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). For each set, the function performs operations based on the provided integers and returns results accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
