Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` must have at least one element, and `j` must be the next valid element in `pl` if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. Initially, `shapes` was 2, so after executing the code, `shapes` becomes 3. The other variables (`palka`, `d`, `pl`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
