Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the last element of `palka`, `d[i]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Here, `i` is the last element of the list `palka`. Since `palka` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is the last element of `palka`, the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1. The other variables and the list `palka` remain unchanged.
