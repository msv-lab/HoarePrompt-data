Output State: **`palka` contains all elements except the first one, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is set to 1**.

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the dictionary `d` at key `i` to 1. This means that if `i` was not previously in the dictionary `d`, it is now added with a value of 1. If `i` was already in the dictionary, its value is incremented by 1, but since the initial state specifies that `d[i]` is either set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and given the initial condition, `d[i]` is set to 1. The values of `palka` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
