Output State: **`palka` must not be empty; `d.get(i)` returns 1**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This operation does not affect the condition that `palka` must not be empty. The previous postcondition that `d.get(i)` returns `None` is no longer true because now `d.get(i)` returns `1`.
