Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `palka`.
   - For each element `i` in `palka`, the loop body is executed (which is omitted in the problem statement).

3. **Determine the postconditions**:
   - `palka` must not be empty.
   - If `i` is in `pl`, then `d.get(i)` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on its original value.
   - If `i` is not in `pl`, the condition does not affect `d.get(i)`.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `palka` must not be empty.
   - `d.get(i)` is updated based on the presence of `i` in `pl`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `palka` must not be empty, and assuming `palka` still contains elements, the first element `i` from `palka` will be processed in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `palka` must not be empty, and `i` should be the first element of `palka`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `palka` must not be empty.
- `i` should be the first element of `palka`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`palka` must not be empty, `i` is the first element of `palka`**
