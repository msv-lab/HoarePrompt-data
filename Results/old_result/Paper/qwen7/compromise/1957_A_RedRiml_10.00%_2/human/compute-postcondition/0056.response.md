Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `palka` is a list of integers entered by the user split from input(), `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, `w` must be greater than 3, `ln` is an input integer.**

The code `pl = []` initializes `pl` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
