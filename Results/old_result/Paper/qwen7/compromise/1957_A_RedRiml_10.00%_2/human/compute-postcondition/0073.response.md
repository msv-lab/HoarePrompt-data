Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the last element of `palka`, and `palka[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `palka` to `1`. Since `i` is defined as the last element of `palka`, the last element of `palka` is now `1`. All other variables and the structure of the list remain unchanged from the initial state.
