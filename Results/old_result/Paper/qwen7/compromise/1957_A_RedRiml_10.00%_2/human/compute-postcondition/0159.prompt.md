Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += 1
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `shapes` is 3, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is a list of all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `shapes` will retain the value it had after the last iteration, which is 3. The list `palka` remains empty because the loop does not add any elements to it. The dictionary `d` is also empty since the loop does not modify it. The list `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, as no elements are added or removed from `pl` during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `shapes` is increased by the number of times the condition `d[j] >= 3` is satisfied for each `j` in `pl`, and `pl` must still contain at least one element after all iterations.

In simpler terms, `shapes` will hold the total count of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times. The list `pl` will be empty or contain elements that have been processed, but it will not affect the final value of `shapes`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `pl` have been iterated over, `shapes` is increased by 1 for each element in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` remains a list of integers with updated counts, and `j` has been incremented for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
