Output State: **`shapes` is increased by the number of times the condition `d[j] >= 3` is satisfied for each `j` in `pl` during the previous iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `ln = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `ln`. The conditions related to `shapes` and `w` remain unchanged from the previous state.
