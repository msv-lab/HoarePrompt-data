Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `palka` is a list of integers entered by the user split from input(), `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is a list of all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, `w` must be greater than 3, `ln` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `palka`. The other variables (`shapes`, `d`, `pl`, `w`, and `ln`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
