Output State: **`palka` contains all elements except the first two, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is set to 1, and `pl` now contains the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of `d[i]` to 1. Since `i` was not previously in `d`, it is added to `d` with a count of 1. Additionally, because `i` is not mentioned as being in `pl` initially, the code adds `i` to `pl`. All other variables remain unchanged.
