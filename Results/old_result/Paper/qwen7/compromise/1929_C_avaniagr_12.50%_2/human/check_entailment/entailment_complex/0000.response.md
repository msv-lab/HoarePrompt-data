Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. The logic in the program is designed to determine if Sasha can ensure he has at least `n` coins for any `n` by checking conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Let's break down the logic:
- If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win by placing a small bet (`1` coin) after a loss because he can recover quickly from a loss due to the small number of consecutive losses allowed.
- If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover a series of losses plus a small win, ensuring he can eventually recover.
- If `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs to calculate a threshold `z` based on the number of consecutive losses `x` and the multiplier `k`. This threshold ensures that Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario of consecutive losses.

The program correctly implements these conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `a` is sufficient to meet the criteria derived from `x` and `k`.

Given the detailed analysis, the program logic matches the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
