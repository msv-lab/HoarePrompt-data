Output State: `t` is `t - 1`, `k` is an input integer, `x` must be equal to or greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 8.

Explanation: The loop increments `z` based on its current value divided by `(k - 1)` plus one. Starting from `z = 0`, after the first iteration, `z` becomes `1`. After the second iteration, `z` becomes `2`. After the third iteration, `z` becomes `4`. Each subsequent iteration doubles the previous value of `z` minus 1. Therefore, after four iterations, `z` will be `8`.
