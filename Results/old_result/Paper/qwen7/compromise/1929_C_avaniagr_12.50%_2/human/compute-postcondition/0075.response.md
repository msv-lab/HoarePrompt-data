Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but since `t` is not explicitly given a value, it remains in the form of `t - 1`.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
