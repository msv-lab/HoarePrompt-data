Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer.
- `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- The first element of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects from the initial state that influence this print statement; it simply prints the string literal `'YES'`.
