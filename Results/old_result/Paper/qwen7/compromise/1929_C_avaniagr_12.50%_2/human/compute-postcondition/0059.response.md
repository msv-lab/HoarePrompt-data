Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be at least 1, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` increments the value of `z` by `z // (k - 1) + 1`. However, since `k` is not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `z`. The only thing we know is that `z` is updated according to the given formula. The other variables `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
