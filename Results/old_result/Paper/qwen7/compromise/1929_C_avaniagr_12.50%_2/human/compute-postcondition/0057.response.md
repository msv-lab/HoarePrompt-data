Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be at least 1, `z` is 2 * (`z // (k - 1) + 1)**

Explanation: Initially, `z` is set to `z // (k - 1) + 1`. After executing `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, `z` is incremented by its initial value, which is `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `z` becomes `2 * (`z // (k - 1) + 1)`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
