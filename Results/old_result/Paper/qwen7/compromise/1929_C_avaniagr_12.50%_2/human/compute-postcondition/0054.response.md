Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(x + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `x`.
   - `x` is an integer inputted from the user.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `x` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(x + 1)` requires `x` to be at least 0).
   - The initial value of `i` is 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0`.

4. **Consider other variables**:
   - `k`, `a`, `t`, and `z` are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect the loop execution. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `x` (it must be a non-negative integer) and `i` (it must be 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be a non-negative integer**
