You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: t is 0, k is an input integer, x is an input integer, a is an input integer, and z is 8.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies parameters t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), k (an integer between 2 and 30), x (an integer between 1 and 100), and a (an integer between 1 and 10^9). It returns an error message if t is less than 1 or greater than 1000, k is less than 2 or greater than 30, x is less than 1 or greater than 100, or a is less than 1 or greater than 10^9. Otherwise, it does not explicitly return anything from the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
