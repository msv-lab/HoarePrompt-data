Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be a non-negative integer, `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`**.

The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `z`. However, the initial value of `z` is not specified, and neither is the value of `k`. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `z` in terms of its original value and the value of `k`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
