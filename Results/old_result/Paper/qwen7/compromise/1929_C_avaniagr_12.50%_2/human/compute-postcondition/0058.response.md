Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` must be at least 1.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body and is only used as a boundary for the loop.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `x` must still be at least 1.

5. **Consider the additional information**: The state also mentions that `z` is calculated as `2 * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`. However, since `z` is not part of the loop head and no information about `z` or `k` is given for adjustment, we do not need to change the state of `z` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be at least 1**
