Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added for each iteration from 0 to `x`.
   - `a` is less than `z`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

Given the initial state, the code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `i`, `x`, `z`, and `a` are not relevant to the print statement itself. The print statement does not reference any of these variables, so their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **NO**
