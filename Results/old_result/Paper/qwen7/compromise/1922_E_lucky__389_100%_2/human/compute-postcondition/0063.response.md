Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.
3. **Initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `1`, `i` must be `1` initially.

Given this information, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- **`i`**: It must be set to `1` to start the loop.
- **`subseq_lens`**: The length of `subseq_lens` must be at least `2` (since the loop runs up to `len(subseq_lens) - 1`), meaning `subseq_lens` must contain at least 2 elements.

Since the initial value of `i` is `1`, we don't need to change `i` directly as it already meets the requirement. However, we need to ensure that `subseq_lens` has at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

- `i` is `1`
- `subseq_lens` must have at least 2 elements

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `subseq_lens` must have at least 2 elements**
