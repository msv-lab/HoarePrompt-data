Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `subseq_lens`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `x`. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` remains an input integer. The new information is that `subseq_lens` is now an empty list.
