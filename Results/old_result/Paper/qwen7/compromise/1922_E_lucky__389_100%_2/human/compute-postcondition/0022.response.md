Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 4, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3], `i` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^{(i-1)}\). Given that `i` is 4, \(2^{(i-1)} = 2^3 = 8\). So, `x -= 8` changes `x` from 8 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
