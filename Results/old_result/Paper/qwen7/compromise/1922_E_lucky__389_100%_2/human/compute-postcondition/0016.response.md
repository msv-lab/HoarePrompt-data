Output State: `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 8, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 4.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(2^i \leq x\). Initially, `x` is set to 0. After the first iteration, `x` becomes 1 (since \(2^1 = 2 > 1\), but we start counting from 0, so it increments `i` to 1). After the second iteration, `i` becomes 2 because \(2^2 = 4 > 1\). After the third iteration, `i` becomes 3 because \(2^3 = 8 > 1\). For the fourth iteration, \(2^4 = 16 > 8\), so the loop terminates. Therefore, the final value of `x` will be 8 (as \(2^3 = 8\)), and `i` will be 4. The values of `mx`, `t`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
