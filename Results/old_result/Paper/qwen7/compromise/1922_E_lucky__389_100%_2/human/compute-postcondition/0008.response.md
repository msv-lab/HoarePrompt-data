The only variable in the loop head is the variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be equal to 0.

However, the current state right before the loop is that `x` is not equal to 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer and must be equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
