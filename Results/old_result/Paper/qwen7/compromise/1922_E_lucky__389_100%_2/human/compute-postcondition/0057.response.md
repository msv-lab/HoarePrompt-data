Output State: **`mx` is either 4 or 6, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 2, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3, 4, i - 1], `i` is at least 5**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^{(i-1)}\) from its current value. Given that `i` is at least 5, the smallest value for \(2^{(i-1)}\) is \(2^{(5-1)} = 2^4 = 16\). Since `x` was initially 4, subtracting 16 would make it negative, which contradicts the given condition that `x` must be 4. Therefore, the only way to satisfy both conditions is if \(2^{(i-1)} = 2\), meaning \(i = 3\), but this contradicts the condition that `i` is at least 5. Hence, the only feasible solution under the given constraints is to assume the subtraction operation results in `x` becoming 2, while keeping other variables unchanged.
