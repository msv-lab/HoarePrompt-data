Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ `n`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9. For each test case, the function does not return a specific value but processes the inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` to perform some operation or check certain conditions.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific operations or return values mentioned in the output, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases, taking in `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case, and performs some unspecified operation or checks on these values.
