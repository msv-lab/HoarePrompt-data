### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit (0 and 1) is even.
   - Therefore, Bob wins if and only if the total count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s (considering 4s as 0s in XOR terms) results in an even count of 1s.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program calculates the sum of `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`.
   - `a // 2` gives the number of pairs of 1s.
   - `b // 2` gives the number of pairs of 2s.
   - `c // 2` gives the number of pairs of 3s.
   - `d // 2` gives the number of pairs of 4s (which do not affect the XOR result).
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of 1s, 2s, and 3s is exactly 3, which means the total count of 1s, 2s, and 3s is odd.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs of numbers that contribute to an even count of 1s and also checks for the exact condition where the total count of 1s, 2s, and 3s is odd.
   - This ensures that the output is the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

**Correctness: True**
