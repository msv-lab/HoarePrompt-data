Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
2. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
3. **Sequence Composition**: Each test case provides the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
4. **Strategy**: Eve removes numbers to maximize Bob's wins. Bob wins if the final XOR is zero.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 for each test case.
2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This part calculates the maximum number of pairs (i.e., even counts) of numbers that can be removed without affecting the final XOR result.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This checks if the sum of the odd counts of numbers 1, 2, and 3 is exactly 3. If so, it adds 1 to the count because removing these specific numbers can make the final XOR zero.

### Detailed Reasoning
- **Even Counts**: Removing pairs of numbers (even counts) does not change the overall XOR value.
- **Odd Counts**: If the sum of the odd counts of numbers 1, 2, and 3 is exactly 3, removing these specific numbers can make the final XOR zero.

### Correctness Check
- The logic correctly handles the even counts and the special condition for odd counts.
- The formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` accurately calculates the maximum number of Bob's wins.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize Bob's wins.

### Conclusion
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
