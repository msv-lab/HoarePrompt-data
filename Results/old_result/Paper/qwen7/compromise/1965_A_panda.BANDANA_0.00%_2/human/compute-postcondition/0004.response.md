Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t indicating the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of integers n and lists of n integers. For each list, it checks if the number 1 is present. If 1 is found in any list, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice' for that test case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
