Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each unique stick length in the list, the function calculates the integer division of its frequency by 3 and returns the sum of these results.**
