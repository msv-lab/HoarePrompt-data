Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `x` and `y`. It does not affect the values of `i`, `coord`, `p2`, `res`, and `n`. The list `coord` is updated to contain the new tuple `(x, y)` since `map(int, input().split())` returns a map object which is then unpacked into `x` and `y`. All other variables retain their initial values.
