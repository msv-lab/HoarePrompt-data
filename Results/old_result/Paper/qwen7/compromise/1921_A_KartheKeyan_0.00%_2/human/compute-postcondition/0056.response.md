Output State: `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing tuples of four pairs of integers entered as inputs, `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs 4 times as defined by `range(4)`. After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to 3 since it increments by 1 at the start of each iteration. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered as inputs during the fourth iteration of the loop. The list `coord` will contain tuples of all pairs of integers entered as inputs over the four iterations. The variable `p2` is updated with the difference `x - y` for each iteration, and `res` remains 0 as no operation updates it within the loop.
