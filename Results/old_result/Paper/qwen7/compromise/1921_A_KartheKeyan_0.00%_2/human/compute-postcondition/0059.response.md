Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing tuples of 4 input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2**.

The code calculates the Euclidean distance squared between the first two points in the sorted list `coord`. This value is assigned to `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
