Output State: **`coord` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `s` is the sum calculated from the loop, `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `coord`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
