Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('4', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('x', 'y'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is (input integer - y), `res` is abs(sqrt(input integer - y) * sqrt(abs((x - 4)))**.

Explanation:
- `p1` is not defined in the code, so it's assumed to be a placeholder. However, since `p1` is not used in the calculation of `res`, it doesn't affect the output state.
- `p2` is calculated as `coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]`, which simplifies to `input integer - y`.
- `res` is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`. Since `p1` is not defined, it is treated as `math.sqrt(input integer - y) * math.sqrt(abs(x - 4))`, and the result is taken as the absolute value.
- The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `coord`, and `p2` are updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.
