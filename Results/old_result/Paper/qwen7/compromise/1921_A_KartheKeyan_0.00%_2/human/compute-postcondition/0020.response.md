Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers from the third split (though their specific values are not provided, we'll refer to them as `x` and `y`).
   - `coord` is a list containing four tuples: 
     - The first tuple is `(1, an input integer)`.
     - The second tuple is `(an input integer, an input integer)`.
     - The third tuple is `(an input integer, an input integer)`.
     - The fourth tuple is `(3, 3)`.
   - `coord` is sorted by their tuple values, so the fourth tuple `(3, 3)` will be the last one in the list after sorting.

2. **Calculating `p2`:**
   - `coord[3]` refers to the last tuple in the sorted `coord` list, which is `(3, 3)`.
   - `coord[2]` refers to the third tuple in the sorted `coord` list.
   - `p2` is calculated as `coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]`, which simplifies to `3 - coord[2][0]`.

3. **Calculating `res`:**
   - `p1` is not defined in the initial state, but it is used in the formula for `res`. Since `p1` is not provided, let's assume it was previously defined and is available.
   - `res` is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) * math.sqrt(p1))`, which simplifies to `abs(math.sqrt(3 - coord[2][0]) * math.sqrt(p1))`.

Given the above, the print statement will output the value of `res`, which is `abs(math.sqrt(3 - coord[2][0]) * math.sqrt(p1))`.

Output: **abs(math.sqrt(3 - coord[2][0]) * math.sqrt(p1))**
