Output State: **`results` is now ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `j` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending 'NO', it becomes `['NO']`. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, and `j` remain unchanged.
