Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the new second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the new second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`, `reachable_second_row` is determined based on whether `row2[j]` is `'> '`: if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>',` then `reachable_second_row` is `True`; otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.
