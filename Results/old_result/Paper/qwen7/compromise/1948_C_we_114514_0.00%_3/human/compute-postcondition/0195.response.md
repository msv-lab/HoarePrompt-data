Postcondition: **`reachable_second_row` is determined based on `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`. If `row1[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`, `j` is incremented by 1, and other variables (`n`, `test_case`, `row1`, `row2`) are updated as per the else part. If `row1[j] != '>'`, then `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `reachable_second_row` is updated based on whether `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`; otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**
