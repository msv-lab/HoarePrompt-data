Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` and `(row1, row2)` are assigned from `test_case`, `j` is less than `n`, and `row1[j]` is not '>'.**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_first_row` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
