Postcondition: **`j` is incremented by 1, `reachable_second_row` is updated based on the following conditions: if `row1[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. If `row1[j] != '>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `False` if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>',` otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. Other variables (`n`, `test_case`, `row1`, `row2`) are updated accordingly.**
