Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for test_case in test_cases:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `test_case` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO']
   - `reachable_second_row` is True
   - `reachable_first_row` is False
   - `j` is equal to `n`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `test_cases` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, the variable `test_case` will change with each iteration.
   - The variable `test_cases` itself does not change within the loop; it remains the same list throughout the loop execution.
   - The variables `results`, `reachable_second_row`, `reachable_first_row`, and `j` (which is equal to `n`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop condition.

5. **Formulate the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `test_case` needs to be set to the next element in `test_cases`. However, since we don't know the exact content of `test_cases`, we can only say that `test_case` will be the next element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, `j` is equal to `n`, `test_case` is the next element in `test_cases`**.
