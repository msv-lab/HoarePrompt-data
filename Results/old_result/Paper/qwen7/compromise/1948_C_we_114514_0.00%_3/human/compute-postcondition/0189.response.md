Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is `True`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the new second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the new second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` sets the variable `reachable_second_row` to `True`. None of the other variables (`j`, `n`, `test_case`, `row1`, `row2`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state, except that `reachable_second_row` is now explicitly set to `True`.
