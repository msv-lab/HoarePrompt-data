Output State: `results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `j` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `reachable_first_row` will be set to False because there are no more elements to check in the range `n`. The condition to set `reachable_second_row` to True has been met multiple times throughout the loop's execution, ensuring it remains True. The variable `j` will be equal to `n` since the loop increments `j` until it reaches `n-1` and then stops. The value of `results` remains unchanged as it was initially an empty list and no operations were performed on it within the loop.
