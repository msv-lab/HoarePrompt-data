Output State: **reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is True, j is j + 1**

Explanation: The variable `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`. The initial values of `reachable_first_row` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, `reachable_first_row` is still `False`, and `j` is updated to `j + 1`.
