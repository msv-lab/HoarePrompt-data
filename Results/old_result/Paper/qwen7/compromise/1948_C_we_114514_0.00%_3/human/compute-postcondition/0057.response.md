Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `j` is `n`.**

The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`, which updates its value from `True` (already set) to `True`. The other variables (`results`, `reachable_first_row`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
