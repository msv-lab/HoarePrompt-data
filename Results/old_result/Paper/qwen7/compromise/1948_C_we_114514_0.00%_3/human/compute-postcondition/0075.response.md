Output State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` and `(row1, row2)` are assigned from `test_case`.**

The code unpacks the tuple `test_case` into two variables: `n` and a tuple `(row1, row2)`. The values of `results`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
