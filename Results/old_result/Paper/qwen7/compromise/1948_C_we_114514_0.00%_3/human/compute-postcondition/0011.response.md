Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n` minus 1, and the current value of `row1[j]` is '>'.

This postcondition summarizes that if `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is set to True, making both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` True. Additionally, `j` is updated to `n - 1`, and the value at `row1[j]` remains '>' since there is no else part to alter these conditions.
