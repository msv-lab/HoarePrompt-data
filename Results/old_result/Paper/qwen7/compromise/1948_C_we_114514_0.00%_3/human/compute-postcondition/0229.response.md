Output State: `results` is a list containing either all 'YES' or a mix of 'YES' and 'NO', depending on the contents of `test_cases`. For each `test_case` in `test_cases`, if `reachable_second_row` is True at the end of the loop execution for that `test_case`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'. Otherwise, it is 'NO'. The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are reset to their initial states (False and False, respectively) before each new `test_case` is processed. The variable `j` is set to `n` at the end of each iteration through `test_cases`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain one 'YES' for every `test_case` where `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing that `test_case`, and 'NO' otherwise.
