Output State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, `j` is equal to `n`, `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of `test_case`.**

Explanation: The tuple `(row1, row2)` is unpacked from `test_case`, assigning the first element of `test_case` to `n` and the second element to both `row1` and `row2`. The variable `test_case` itself is updated to point to the next element in `test_cases`. All other variables remain unchanged.
