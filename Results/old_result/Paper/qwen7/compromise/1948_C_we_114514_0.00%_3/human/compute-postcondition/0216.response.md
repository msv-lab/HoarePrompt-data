Postcondition: `reachable_second_row` is True if `row1[j]` is '>', and `j` is either equal to `n - 1` or has been incremented by 1 if `row1[j]` is not '>'. If `row1[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains True and `j` remains unchanged. If `row1[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` remains False, `reachable_second_row` becomes True, and `j` is incremented by 1.
