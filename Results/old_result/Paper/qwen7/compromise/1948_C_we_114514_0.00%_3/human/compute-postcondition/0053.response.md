Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is either False or remains unchanged, and `j` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. This does not affect the values of `results`, `reachable_first_row`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the updated value of `reachable_second_row`.
