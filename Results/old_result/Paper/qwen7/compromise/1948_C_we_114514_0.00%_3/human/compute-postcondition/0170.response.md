Output State: **reachable_first_row is False, j is less than n-1, reachable_second_row is True, n is the first element of test_case, test_case is updated to contain the next element in test_cases, row1 is the second element of test_case, row2 is the second element of test_case, and the current value of row2[j] is '>'**.

This output state reflects that the variable `reachable_second_row` has been explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
