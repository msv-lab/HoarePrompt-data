Output State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is False, `reachable_first_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n`, `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of `test_case`.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = False` changes the value of `reachable_second_row` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
