Postcondition: `j` is incremented by 1, `reachable_second_row` is updated based on the following conditions: if `row1[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. If `row1[j] != '>'` and `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>', then `reachable_second_row` is `False`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged based on the original conditions provided. Other variables (`n`, `test_case`, `row1`, `row2`) are updated accordingly.
