Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(n)`.
   - The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
     - `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'].
     - `reachable_second_row` is True.
     - `j` is equal to `n - 1`.
     - The current value of `row2[j]` is '>'.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = n - 1` (at the end of the previous iteration).
   - The loop will increment `j` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `n - 1 + 1 = n`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `for j in range(n)`, which means `j` should be less than `n` for the loop to continue.
   - Since `j` is incremented from `n - 1` to `n`, it will no longer satisfy the condition `j < n` because `n` is not less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop will not execute again due to the condition `j < n` being false, we do not need to change the values of `j` or `n`.
   - However, we need to ensure that the other states remain consistent with the postconditions provided.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time (which it won't in this case) would be:

- `results` remains a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'].
- `reachable_second_row` remains True.
- `j` remains `n - 1` (since the loop will not execute again).
- `row2[j]` remains '>' (since the loop will not execute again).

Since the loop will not execute again, we do not need to update `j` to `n`. The final state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'**.
