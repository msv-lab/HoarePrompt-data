Postcondition: `j` is less than `n`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the updated second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`. If `row1[j]` is '>', and either `j` equals `n - 1` or the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False.
