Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is less than `n` minus 1, and `row1[j]` is not '>', unless `j` equals `n` minus 1, in which case `reachable_first_row` is True and `j` is equal to `n` minus 1, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'.
