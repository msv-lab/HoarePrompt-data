Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case, extracting the dimensions and the directions of the arrows for both rows.

2. **Logic Implementation**: 
   - It initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
   - It iterates through each column of the grid.
   - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it checks if it has reached the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. Otherwise, it transitions to the second row.
   - If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it checks if it has reached the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Result Collection**: After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the constraints and the problem description, this implementation correctly determines whether the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the given grid configuration.
