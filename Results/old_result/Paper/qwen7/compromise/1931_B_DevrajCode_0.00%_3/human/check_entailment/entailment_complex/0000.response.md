Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is done efficiently using `sys.stdin.read()` and `split()`.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `n` and `a` from the input data.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Total Water Calculation**: It calculates the total amount of water using `sum(a)`.
   - **Initial Check**: It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - **Target Water Calculation**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - **Cumulative Difference Calculation**: It iterates through the list `a` and calculates the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target. If at any point this difference causes the cumulative value to become negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water evenly, so it returns 'No'.
   - **Final Check**: If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the water can be evenly distributed, so it returns 'Yes'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
