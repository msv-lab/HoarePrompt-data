### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to check if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container's index is always less than the destination container's index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), it is theoretically possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers. This means each container should end up with `total_water / n` units of water.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it returns 'No'.
   - If it is divisible, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount accumulates to a negative value. If it does, it means it's impossible to balance the water, and it returns 'No'.
   - If no such accumulation occurs, it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` correctly.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the algorithm. The code only checks if the cumulative difference (`container`) ever becomes negative, but it does not ensure that the water can actually be poured from one container to another in the required manner (i.e., from lower-indexed to higher-indexed containers).

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`.
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the target amount of water each container should have.
   - The algorithm correctly checks if the cumulative difference ever becomes negative, which is a necessary condition for the water to be unbalanced.
   - However, the algorithm does not verify that the water can be poured in the required manner (from lower-indexed to higher-indexed containers). This is a crucial part of the problem that the current implementation does not address.

6. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The code reads input from standard input, which is fine for the given problem constraints.
   - The output format matches the required format.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n` and ensures that the cumulative difference does not become negative. However, it does not verify that the water can be poured from lower-indexed to higher-indexed containers, which is a critical requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Correctness:

**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
