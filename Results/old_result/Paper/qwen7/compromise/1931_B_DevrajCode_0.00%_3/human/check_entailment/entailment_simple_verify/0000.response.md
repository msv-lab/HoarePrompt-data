### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program works as intended. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n` using `total_water % n != 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it immediately returns 'No'. This check is correct because if the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. **Target Calculation**:
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - This calculation is straightforward and correct.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount accumulates to zero.
   - It maintains a running sum `container` that tracks the net difference between the current water amount and the target amount.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water, and the program returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means the water can be balanced, and the program returns 'Yes'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The annotations also correctly reflect the states and transitions of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
