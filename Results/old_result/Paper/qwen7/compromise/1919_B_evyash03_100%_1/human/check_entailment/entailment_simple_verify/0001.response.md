### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`length`) and the string itself (`expression`).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(expression, length)` to compute the minimum penalty.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length`.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in the string, which corresponds to the number of 1's in the array `a`.
   - `sub` is calculated as the difference between the length of the string and the count of '+' characters, which corresponds to the number of -1's in the array `a`.
   - The function returns the absolute difference between `count` and `sub`, which is `abs(length - 2 * count)`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of 1's and -1's, which does not necessarily give the minimum penalty.
   - To minimize the penalty, we need to consider how to split the array optimally. The optimal strategy is to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero whenever possible, which would result in a penalty of 0 for those segments.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example test case `+-+-+`, the function incorrectly returns 4, but the correct minimum penalty should be 0 by splitting into `([1], [-1], [1], [-1], [1])`.
   - For the test case `--+++++++-`, the function incorrectly returns 4, but the correct minimum penalty should be 0 by splitting into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`.

Given the analysis, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem. The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the function does not correctly minimize the penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
