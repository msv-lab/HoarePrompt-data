Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. The conditions and the corresponding outputs ('STAIRS', 'PEAK', 'NONE') are correctly implemented.
5. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the implementation.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

Correctness: **True**
