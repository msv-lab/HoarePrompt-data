### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a critical issue with the condition checking for 'PEAK'. The condition `a < b > c` should be `a < b and b > c` to correctly identify a peak. The current condition `a < b > c` is not syntactically correct in Python and does not achieve the intended comparison.

To illustrate, consider the test case `3 2 1`:
- The condition `a < b > c` evaluates to `3 < 2 > 1`, which simplifies to `3 < True`, which is always `False`. Therefore, the program incorrectly prints 'NONE' instead of 'PEAK'.

Similarly, for the test case `4 1 7`:
- The condition `a < b > c` evaluates to `4 < 1 > 7`, which simplifies to `4 < False`, which is also `False`. Therefore, the program incorrectly prints 'NONE' instead of 'STAIRS'.

The correct condition should be `a < b and b > c` to ensure that both conditions are met simultaneously.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the identified issue with the condition checking for 'PEAK', the original program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
