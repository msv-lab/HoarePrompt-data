Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program correctly reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The program checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If the conditions for a stair or a peak are met, the program prints the corresponding string ("STAIRS" or "PEAK"). Otherwise, it prints "NONE".
5. The logic for checking the conditions is correct and matches the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
