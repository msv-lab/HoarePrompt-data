Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is `lex` - 26, `arr` contains the elements [1, 26] if `lex` is less than 1, [26] if `lex` is between 1 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), and remains unchanged if `lex` is 26 or greater.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Depending on the new value of `lex`, the contents of `arr` will change accordingly. If `lex` was originally less than 27, the new value of `lex` will determine the state of `arr`. If `lex` was originally between 27 and 52, the state of `arr` will remain unchanged because the decrement brings it below 27. If `lex` was 52 or greater, `arr` remains unchanged.
