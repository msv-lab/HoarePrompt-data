Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is [1, 26], `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than or equal to 52, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is either [1] or [26] depending on the value of `lex`. After appending 26, `arr` becomes [1, 26] if it was initially [1], or [26, 26] if it was initially [26]. However, since `lex` is less than or equal to 52, `arr` cannot be [26, 26], so it must be [1, 26]. The values of `i`, `cases`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.
