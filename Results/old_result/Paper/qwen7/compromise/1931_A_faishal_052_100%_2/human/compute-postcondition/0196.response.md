Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each containing an integer `lex` ranging from 28 to 78. For each test case, it processes `lex` by subtracting 2, 26, or 52 based on certain conditions, sorts the resulting values, and appends the final value of `lex` to the list. It then constructs a string from the first three elements of each processed list and prints these strings. The function does not return any value but prints the constructed strings for each test case.**
