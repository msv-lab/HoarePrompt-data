Output State: **`arr` contains [26, 26, 'lex'], `lex` is an integer, `j` is 2, and `i` is 100**

The code appends the list `arr` to the `info` list. Since the initial value of `arr` is [26, 26, 'lex'], after appending, `arr` remains unchanged as the operation modifies `info`. The values of `lex`, `j`, and `i` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
