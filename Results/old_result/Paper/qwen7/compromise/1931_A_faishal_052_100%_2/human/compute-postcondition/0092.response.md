Output State: **`lex` is an integer, `arr` contains 27, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the element 26. After appending 1, `arr` will contain 26 and 1, making it a list with two elements: 26 and 1, which can be described as `arr` contains 27 (if considering the count of elements). The variable `lex` remains unchanged as an integer, and `j` remains 2.
