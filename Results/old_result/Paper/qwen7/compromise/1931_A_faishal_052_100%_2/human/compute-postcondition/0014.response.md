Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is a list containing 26, `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than 26, and `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was originally less than 52, subtracting 26 from it ensures that `lex` is now less than 26. The other variables remain unchanged.
