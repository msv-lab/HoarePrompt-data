Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 2`, `lex - 26`, or `lex - 52` depending on the initial value of `lex`, and `arr` is updated to contain the element `lex`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, `arr` will contain the elements as described in the initial state, with the new element `lex` added to the list.
