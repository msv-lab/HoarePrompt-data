Output State: **`lex` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Since `lex` was unaffected by this operation, its value range remains the same. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list `arr`.
