Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will range from 0 to `cases-1` (since the loop runs `cases` times), `cases` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `info` is a list containing `cases` elements, each of which is a list `arr`. Each `arr` is a sorted list that starts with one or more occurrences of 1 or 26, followed by the final value of `lex` after processing. The value of `lex` in each `arr` is the result of subtracting either 1, 26, or 52 from the initial value of `lex` based on the conditions in the loop. `j` will always be 2 since it increments once per iteration and the loop runs `cases` times.
