Output State: **`j` must take on the values 0 and 1, and the value of `lex` is less than 27; `arr` contains the element 1**

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 1` decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Since the initial condition was that `lex` is less than 28, after decrementing, `lex` will now be less than 27. All other variables remain unchanged, so `j` still must take on the values 0 and 1, and `arr` still contains the element 1.
