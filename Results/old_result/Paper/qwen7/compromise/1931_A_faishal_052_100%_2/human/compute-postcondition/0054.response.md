Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]`, `lex` is reduced by either 2 or 52, `j` is 1.**

This output state reflects that the loop has completed its iterations, and the values of the variables are updated accordingly. The list `arr` contains the values determined by the conditions met during the loop, `lex` has been reduced by either 2 or 52, and `j` is set to 1 after the last iteration.
