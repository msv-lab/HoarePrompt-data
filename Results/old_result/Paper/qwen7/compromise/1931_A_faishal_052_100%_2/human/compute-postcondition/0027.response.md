Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in range(2)` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: At the start of the loop, `j` is set to 0 (as per the given postcondition).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < 2`. After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\).
   - `arr` is either [1] or a list containing 26, depending on whether `lex` is less than 28 or not.
   - `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than or equal to 52.
   - `j` is 0.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `j < 2`, after the first iteration, `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `cases` remains unchanged.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `lex` remains unchanged.
   - `j` changes from 0 to 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either [1] or a list containing 26, depending on whether `lex` is less than 28 or not, `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than or equal to 52, and `j` is 1.**
