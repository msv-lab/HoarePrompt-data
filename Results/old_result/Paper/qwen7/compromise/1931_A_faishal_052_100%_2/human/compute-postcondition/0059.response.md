Output State: **`i` is 1, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `j` is 1, `info` now contains the list `arr`**.

This means that the value of `lex` is updated to the integer input from the user, while the other variables remain unchanged.
