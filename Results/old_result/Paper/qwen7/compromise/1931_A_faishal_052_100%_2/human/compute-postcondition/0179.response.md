Output State: `temp` is 'abcdefe', `i` is 7, `j` is 5.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified by the range(3). After each iteration, `temp` is updated by appending a character based on the value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Since the loop completes 3 iterations, `j` will be 5 (as it increments with each iteration) and `i` will increment by 3 (from 4 to 7) because the loop does not modify `i` directly but `i` is incremented implicitly by the loop's logic over multiple iterations. The final value of `temp` after 3 iterations is 'abcdefe'.
