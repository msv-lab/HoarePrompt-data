Output State: `temp` is 'abcdefe', `i` is 7, `j` is 5.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified by the range(3). After each iteration, `temp` is updated by appending a character based on the value of `info[i][j] + 96`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4 throughout the loop, but `j` starts from 0 and reaches 5 after 3 iterations. Since the loop condition is met exactly 3 times, `temp` will end up as 'abcdefe' after all iterations. The variable `i` increments by 3 (since it was initially 4 and no increment is shown in the loop body) to become 7.
