Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `j` is 1, `info` now contains the list `arr`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains 1. If `lex` is between 2 and 26 (excluding 27 and including 26), `arr` contains 26. If `lex` is 27 or greater, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` contains 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `lex` is an integer, `arr` contains 26, and `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is equal to its original value minus 1 and `arr` contains 1 and 26. If `lex` is 28 or greater, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `lex` is an integer, `arr` contains 26 and 26, `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is set to 27. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is set to 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `lex` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
