Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer, `j` is 2, `i` is 101, `cases` must be greater than 100**

The code `arr = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `arr`, making its previous contents `[26, 26, 'lex']` invalid. The other variables (`lex`, `j`, `i`, and `cases`) remain unchanged.
