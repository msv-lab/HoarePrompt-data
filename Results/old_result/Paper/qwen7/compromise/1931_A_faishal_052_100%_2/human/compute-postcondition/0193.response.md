Output State: `temp` is 'aamo', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `cases` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` remains at 4 because it is not incremented within the loop body. The variable `j` reaches 3 after the last iteration. The final value of `temp` is 'aamo' as it was constructed over the course of the three iterations. The `cases` variable, which determines the number of loop iterations, is 3, confirming that the loop has completed all its intended executions.
