Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 2, `i` is 101, `cases` must be greater than 100**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `lex`. The values of `arr`, `j`, `i`, and `cases` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input integer is stored in `lex`.
