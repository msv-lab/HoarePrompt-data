Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26` depending on the initial value of `lex`. If `lex` was less than 27, `arr` contains the elements [1, 1] or [1, 26]. If `lex` was between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26, 1] or [26]. If `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element 1.
