Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in range(3):` statement. The variables involved in this loop are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `temp` is 'aam'
   - `i` is 5
   - `j` is 2
   - `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `range(3)`, meaning `j` will take values from 0 to 2 inclusive.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be 3 (if the loop continues).

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we need to update its value. The other variables (`temp`, `i`, and `cases`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

6. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be within the range specified by `range(3)`. Since `j` will be 3, it will no longer be within the range, but the loop will still execute once more before exiting.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`temp` is 'aam', `i` is 5, `j` is 3, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3**
