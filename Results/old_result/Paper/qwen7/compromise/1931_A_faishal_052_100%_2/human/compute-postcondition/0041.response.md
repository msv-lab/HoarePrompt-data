Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either [1, 1, 1] or [1, 26, 1] or [26, 1], `lex` is reduced by 1 or 26, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. Depending on the initial value of `arr`, it changes as follows:
- If `arr` was `[1, 1]`, it becomes `[1, 1, 1]`.
- If `arr` was `[1, 26]`, it becomes `[1, 26, 1]`.
- If `arr` was `[26]`, it becomes `[26, 1]`.

All other variables (`i`, `cases`, `lex`, `j`) remain unchanged.
