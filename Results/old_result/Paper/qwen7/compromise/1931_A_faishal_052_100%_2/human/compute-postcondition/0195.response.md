Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, but these integers are not passed directly to the function. Instead, the function returns based on the conditions provided for `t` and `n`.**
