Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will range from 0 to `cases-1`, meaning it will take on every integer value within that range exactly once. `cases` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\). The variable `arr` will contain a list of integers where each list represents the processed values of `lex` for a particular test case, with `lex` being reduced by either 2, 26, or 52 based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each `arr` list will be sorted. The variable `lex` will hold the final value after processing for each test case, which is appended to `arr`. The `info` list will contain all the `arr` lists generated for each test case, sorted as per the loop's operation.
    #
    #In summary, `info` will be a list of lists, where each inner list represents the processed values of `lex` for a specific test case, sorted according to the operations performed in the loop.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: Output State: `temp` is 'aamo', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `cases` is 3.
    #
    #Explanation: After analyzing the loop and the given states, we can conclude that the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `i` remains at 4 because it is not incremented within the loop body. The variable `j` reaches 3 after 3 iterations. The variable `temp` concatenates characters derived from `info[i][j] + 96`, resulting in the string 'aamo'. Since the loop runs exactly 3 times, `cases` must be 3, and there are no further iterations to consider. Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `temp` being 'aamo', `i` remaining 4, `j` at 3, and `cases` being 3.
