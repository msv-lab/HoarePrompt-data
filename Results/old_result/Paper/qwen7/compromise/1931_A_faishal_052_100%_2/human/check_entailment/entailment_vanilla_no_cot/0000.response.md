Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Logic for Calculating Character Positions**: 
   - The logic for determining the character positions in the word is flawed. It incorrectly handles the calculation of the remaining character after the first two characters are determined.
   
2. **Sorting and Appending**:
   - The program sorts the list `arr` which can lead to incorrect results. Sorting is unnecessary and can disrupt the correct order of character positions.
   
3. **Handling Lexicographically Smallest Word**:
   - The program does not ensure that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest. It incorrectly appends the remaining value to the list without considering the correct order of characters.

### Correct Solution:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the first character
        first_char = min(lex // 26, 26)
        lex -= first_char * 26
        # Determine the second character
        second_char = min(lex // 26, 26)
        lex -= second_char * 26
        # Determine the third character
        third_char = lex
        # Convert to characters
        word = chr(first_char + 96) + chr(second_char + 96) + chr(third_char + 96)
        print(word)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **First Character Calculation**: 
  - Calculate the first character by dividing the total sum by 26 and taking the minimum with 26.
  - Subtract the contribution of the first character from the total sum.
  
- **Second Character Calculation**: 
  - Similarly, calculate the second character by dividing the remaining sum by 26 and taking the minimum with 26.
  - Subtract the contribution of the second character from the remaining sum.
  
- **Third Character Calculation**: 
  - The remaining sum will be the third character.
  
- **Convert to Characters**: 
  - Convert the calculated values back to characters using `chr(i + 96)`.

This approach ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is generated for each test case.
