The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\):

- If \(2b < c\), it prints \(a \times b\).
- If \(a\) is even and \(2b \geq c\), it prints \(\frac{a \times c}{2}\).
- Otherwise, it first prints \(X = \frac{a}{2}\) and then prints \(X \times c + b\).

After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value, only printing the results to the console.
