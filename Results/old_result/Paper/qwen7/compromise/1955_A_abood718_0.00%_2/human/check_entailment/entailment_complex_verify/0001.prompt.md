You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each line containing the result of one of the conditions in the loop. Specifically, for each iteration \(i\):
    #
    #- If \(B \times 2 < C\), the output will be \(A \times B\).
    #- If \(A\) is even and \(B \times 2 \geq C\), the output will be \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
    #- Otherwise, the output will be two lines: \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) and \(X \times C + B\).
    #
    #The total number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases specified by `int(input())`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\):

- If \(2b < c\), it prints \(a \times b\).
- If \(a\) is even and \(2b \geq c\), it prints \(\frac{a \times c}{2}\).
- Otherwise, it first prints \(X = \frac{a}{2}\) and then prints \(X \times c + b\).

After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value, only printing the results to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the regular price of two yogurts (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so the total cost is `A * B`.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A % 2 == 0`, it means the number of yogurts `A` is even.
     - In this case, the program calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)` which is the cost of buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A % 2 != 0`, it means the number of yogurts `A` is odd.
     - The program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then adds `B` without calculating the actual cost.
     - It should calculate the cost as `X * C + B` to account for the remaining single yogurt bought at the regular price.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that when the number of yogurts is odd, the program correctly calculates the cost as `X * C + B`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in handling the case when the number of yogurts is odd. It should correctly calculate the cost as `X * C + B` instead of just printing `X`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
