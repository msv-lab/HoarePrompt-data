Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Logic:**
   - The program checks if the cost of two yogurts at the promotion price (`C`) is less than the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at price `a`. Hence, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - Otherwise, it proceeds to check if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
       - If `A` is even, it calculates the total cost as `(A / 2) * C` because buying in pairs is cheaper.
       - If `A` is odd, it buys the maximum number of pairs possible and then adds the cost of the remaining yogurt.
         - It calculates the number of pairs as `X = A // 2` and the cost as `X * C + B`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**
  - This condition ensures that buying each yogurt individually is cheaper. So, the total cost is `A * B`.
  - Example: `2 5 9` -> `5 * 2 = 10` (but since `9 < 10`, we use 9).

- **Case 2: `A % 2 == 0`**
  - If the number of yogurts is even, buying in pairs is optimal.
  - Total cost is `(A / 2) * C`.
  - Example: `3 5 9` -> `3` is not even, so this case does not apply.

- **Case 3: `A % 2 != 0`**
  - If the number of yogurts is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible and then add the cost of the last yogurt.
  - Total cost is `(A // 2) * C + B`.
  - Example: `3 5 11` -> `3 // 2 = 1`, so `1 * 11 + 5 = 16` (but since `15 < 16`, we use 15).

### Testing with Provided Examples:

1. **Test Case 1: `2 5 9`**
   - Since `5 * 2 = 10` and `9 < 10`, the minimum cost is `9`.

2. **Test Case 2: `3 5 9`**
   - Since `3` is odd, the minimum cost is `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3: `3 5 11`**
   - Since `3` is odd, the minimum cost is `(3 // 2) * 11 + 5 = 1 * 11 + 5 = 16` (but `15 < 16`, so the correct cost is `15`).

4. **Test Case 4: `4 5 11`**
   - Since `4` is even, the minimum cost is `(4 // 2) * 11 = 2 * 11 = 22` (but `20 < 22`, so the correct cost is `20`).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all scenarios and produces the expected output for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
