Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. A key aspect is understanding that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation in `func_1` simply counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand (`a`). This is incorrect because:
   - The count of numbers appearing exactly twice does not directly translate to your potential score.
   - Nene's strategy involves selecting cards to maximize her score while minimizing yours. This means she would avoid picking up cards that would allow you to score points.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize your score, you should try to force Nene to pick up cards that do not allow her to score points.
   - If a number appears only once in your hand, Nene will pick it up to avoid giving you a point.
   - If a number appears twice in your hand, you can strategically pick one card to ensure Nene picks the other, thus scoring a point.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Count the frequency of each number in your hand.
   - For each number that appears exactly once, you cannot score any points since Nene will pick it up.
   - For each number that appears twice, you can score one point by ensuring Nene picks one of the two cards.

Given this, the correct implementation should:
- Count the frequency of each number.
- Subtract the count of numbers that appear exactly once from the total count of numbers (since those are the ones you cannot score points on).
- The remaining count will be the maximum number of points you can get.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
    
    max_score = 0
    for num in count_a.values():
        if num == 1:
            continue
        elif num == 2:
            max_score += 1
    
    return max_score
```

This code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

Correctness: **False**
