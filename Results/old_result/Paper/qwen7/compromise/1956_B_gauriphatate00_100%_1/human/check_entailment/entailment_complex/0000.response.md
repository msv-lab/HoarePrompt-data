Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by optimally selecting cards to place on the table. A point is earned if the card you place matches a card already on the table. Nene, being smart, will always try to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation of `func_1` simply counts how many numbers in the list `a` appear exactly twice. This is incorrect because:
   - It does not account for the strategy Nene uses to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - It does not simulate the game turns where both players make optimal moves.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - You need to simulate the game turns where both you and Nene make optimal moves.
   - For each of your moves, consider the best possible move for Nene and adjust your strategy accordingly.
   - Track the state of the table and the remaining cards in your hand to make informed decisions.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the first example, the output should be 1, but the current implementation would incorrectly output 2 because it only counts the numbers appearing exactly twice without considering the optimal play of Nene.

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
