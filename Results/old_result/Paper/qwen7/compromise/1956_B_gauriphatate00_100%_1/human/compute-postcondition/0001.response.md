Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num`, which iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive.
   - Each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list.
   - `count_a` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`.
   - Therefore, the state of `a` must be such that it contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `a` is a list and the loop will iterate over its elements, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty.
   - Additionally, since each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice, the list `a` can contain up to `2n` elements, but it must contain at least one element for the loop to start.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `a` must contain at least one element.
   - The contents of `a` do not need to be specified further because the loop will handle each element individually.
   - `count_a` remains an empty dictionary as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `count_a` is an empty dictionary**.
