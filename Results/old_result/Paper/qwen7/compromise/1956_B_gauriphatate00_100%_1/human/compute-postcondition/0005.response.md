Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `num` using `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `max_score` is given as 0.
   - `count_a` is a dictionary where the keys are unique integers from the list `a` and the values are their counts.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range, but its value is not specified in the initial state.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the range function starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `max_score` is not directly related to the loop condition, it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `num`.

State: **`max_score` is 0, `num` is 1 (initial value of the loop), `n` must be at least 1**
