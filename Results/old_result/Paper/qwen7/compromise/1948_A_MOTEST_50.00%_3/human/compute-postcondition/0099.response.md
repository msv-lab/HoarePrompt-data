Output State: **`ans` is 'AAABBBCC', `x` is 2, `i` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 2, the character at index 2 in the string `'AAABBB'` is 'B'. Therefore, `ans` becomes `'AAABBBCC'` (appending 'B' twice). The values of `x`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
