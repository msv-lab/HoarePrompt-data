Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `s` is a string containing all uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z'
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans = ''
        x = 0
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        else:
            ans, x = 'AAA', 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer. If `n` equals 1, then `t` remains greater than 0 and `n` is 1. Otherwise, `n` must be at least 2, and `t` remains greater than 0. Additionally, `ans` is a string that either contains the concatenated result of doubling the character at index `n // 2 - 1` of `s` for each iteration where `j` equals `n // 2`, or it consists of a string of 'A' repeated `n // 2 - 1` times followed by `n // 2 - 1` times the character at index `n // 2` or `n // 2 + 1` of `s`, depending on whether `n % 2 == 0` is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 more than its initial value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` will either hold the accumulated sum of twice each element starting from `s[0]` up to `s[n//2 - 1]` or be 'AAAAAAAAA', `x` will be `n // 2` or 5, and `j` will be `n // 2` or 6, depending on whether `n` is even or odd and its specific value, and if `n == 1`, `ans` will be the concatenated result of doubling the character at index `n // 2 - 1` of `s` for each iteration where `j` equals `n // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is either 2 more than its initial value or 3, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ans` will either hold the accumulated sum of twice each element starting from `s[0]` up to `s[n//2 - 1]` or be 'AAAAAAAAA' or 'AAABBBCCCCC', `x` will be `n // 2` or 5, and `j` will be `n // 2` or 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
