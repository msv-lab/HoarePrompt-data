Output State: **`max_index` is the largest value of i for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', or 0 if no such i exists; `min_indices` is a list containing the indices of all i such that `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' for each i in `min_indices`; `min_index` is `max_index`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `min_indices` to the variable `min_index`. Since initially `min_indices` contains only `max_index`, `min_index` will be set to `max_index`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
