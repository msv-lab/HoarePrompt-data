Output State: **`max_index` is the largest value of i for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', or 0 if no such i exists; `min_indices` is a list containing the indices of all i such that `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' for each i in `min_indices`; `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices` that satisfies the condition `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i) == '='` for all i in `min_indices`. If no such index exists, then `min_index` is equal to `max_index`; `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code simply calls the function `func_2` with arguments `max_index` and `min_index`. No new variables are defined or modified within the given code snippet. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the fact that `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been executed.
