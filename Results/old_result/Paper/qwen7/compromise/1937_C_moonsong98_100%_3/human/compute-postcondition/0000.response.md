Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, 2 <= n <= 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specified that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^4`, after executing the code, `n` will now hold the specific integer input within this range. All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition on `n` is updated to reflect its new value.
