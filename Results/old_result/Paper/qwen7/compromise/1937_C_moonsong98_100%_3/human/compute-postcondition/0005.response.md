Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `max_index` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `max_index` to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an integer between 2 and \(10^4\) (inclusive) and not equal to 2.
