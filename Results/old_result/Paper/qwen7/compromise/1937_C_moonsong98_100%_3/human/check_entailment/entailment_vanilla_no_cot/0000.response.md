Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has several issues:

1. **Query Handling**: The program uses `input().strip()` to read the response from the judge, which is fine. However, it doesn't handle the responses correctly to identify the maximum XOR pair.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum XOR Pair**: The logic in `func_3` is flawed. It tries to find the maximum index (`max_index`) and then finds the minimum index (`min_index`) among those that give a smaller OR value. This approach is not guaranteed to find the maximum XOR pair efficiently.

3. **Efficiency**: The program makes more than 3n queries in some cases, which violates the problem constraints. For example, when finding the minimum indices, it iterates through all indices, leading to a high number of queries.

4. **Incorrect Query Strategy**: The strategy used to find the minimum indices and then the minimum index among them is not optimal. It doesn't ensure that the final pair `(max_index, min_index)` will have the maximum XOR value.

5. **Missing XOR Calculation**: The program does not actually calculate the XOR values and compare them to find the maximum. Instead, it relies on the OR comparisons, which is not sufficient to guarantee finding the maximum XOR pair.

### Suggested Approach:
A more efficient approach involves using the properties of XOR and OR operations to reduce the number of queries. Hereâ€™s a revised plan:

1. **Binary Search for Maximum XOR**: Use binary search to find the maximum XOR value.
2. **Query Optimization**: Use the results of previous queries to optimize future queries.

Here's a more effective implementation:

```python
import sys

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print(f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    return input().strip()

def func_2(a, b):
    print(f'! {a} {b}')
    sys.stdout.flush()

def find_max_xor(n):
    low, high = 0, n-1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        res = func_1(low, mid, high, mid+1)
        if res == '=':
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    max_index = low
    min_index = low
    for i in range(n):
        res = func_1(max_index, i, min_index, i)
        if res == '<':
            min_index = i
    func_2(max_index, min_index)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    find_max_xor(n)
```

This approach uses binary search to narrow down the indices with the highest potential for maximum XOR and then optimizes further by comparing with other indices. This should meet the problem constraints and requirements.
