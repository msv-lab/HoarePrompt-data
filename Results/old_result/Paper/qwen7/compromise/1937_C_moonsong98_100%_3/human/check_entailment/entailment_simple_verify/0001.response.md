### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Initialization and Input Reading
- The program correctly reads `n` (the size of the permutation).
- For `n == 2`, it directly outputs the indices `[0, 1]` without further querying. This part is correct for `n == 2`.

#### Finding the Maximum Index
- The program initializes `max_index` to `0`.
- It iterates through all indices from `0` to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_0 | p_max_index)` with `(p_0 | p_i)`.
- If `(p_0 | p_i)` is less than `(p_0 | p_max_index)`, it updates `max_index` to `i`.
- This step aims to find an index `max_index` such that `(p_0 | p_max_index)` is maximized. This is a good approach to start finding the maximum potential candidate.

#### Finding the Minimum Indices
- The program initializes `min_indices` with `max_index`.
- It iterates through all indices again and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])` with `(p_max_index | p_i)`.
- If `(p_max_index | p_i)` is less than `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`.
- If `(p_max_index | p_i)` is equal to `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])`, it appends `i` to `min_indices`.
- This step aims to find the minimum indices that have the same bitwise OR with `p_max_index`. This helps in narrowing down the search space.

#### Final Selection
- The program selects `min_index` from `min_indices` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_min_index | p_min_index)` with `(p_min_index | p_i)` for each `i` in `min_indices`.
- If `(p_min_index | p_i)` is equal to `(p_min_index | p_min_index)`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.
- This step ensures that `min_index` is the one that maintains the maximum bitwise OR with `p_max_index`.

#### Output
- The program outputs the indices `max_index` and `min_index` using `func_2`.

### Verification

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The approach of finding `max_index` and then `min_indices` is sound. It leverages the properties of bitwise OR and XOR operations.
  - The final selection of `min_index` ensures that the pair `(max_index, min_index)` has the maximum possible XOR value.

- **Query Count:**
  - The program makes a total of `4n - 4` queries (3n for the main loop and 1n for the final selection), which is within the limit of `3n`.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - State: `n` is read and stored.
   - If `n == 2`, the program directly outputs `[0, 1]` and returns. This is correct.

2. **Finding the Maximum Index:**
   - State: `max_index` is initialized to `0`.
   - Iteration through indices from `0` to `n-1`:
     - Query: `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` is made.
     - If `(p_0 | p_i) < (p_0 | p_max_index)`, `max_index` is updated to `i`.
   - After the loop, `max_index` is the index such that `(p_0 | p_max_index)` is maximized.

3. **Finding the Minimum Indices:**
   - State: `min_indices` is initialized with `max_index`.
   - Iteration through indices from `0` to `n-1`:
     - Query: `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` is made.
     - If `(p_max_index | p_i) < (p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])`, `min_indices` is updated to `[i]`.
     - If `(p_max_index | p_i) == (p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])`, `i` is appended to `min_indices`.
   - After the loop, `min_indices` contains indices that have the same bitwise OR with `p_max_index`.

4. **Final Selection:**
   - State: `min_index` is selected from `min_indices`.
   - Iteration through `min_indices`:
     - Query: `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` is made.
     - If `(p_min_index | p_i) == (p_min_index | p_min_index)`, `min_index` is updated to `i`.
   - After the loop, `min_index` is the index that maintains the maximum bitwise OR with `p_max_index`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the indices `max_index` and `min_index` using `func_2`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the indices with the maximum XOR value using the allowed number of queries.
