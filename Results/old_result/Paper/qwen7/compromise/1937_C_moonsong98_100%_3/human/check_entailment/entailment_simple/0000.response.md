### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly initializes the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_3()` to handle the logic for finding the indices \( i \) and \( j \) that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

2. **Function Definitions:**
   - `func_1(a, b, c, d)` correctly prints the query and reads the response, ensuring proper flushing of the output.
   - `func_2(a, b)` correctly prints the result and flushes the output.

3. **Main Logic in `func_3`:**
   - The program handles the special case when \( n = 2 \) by directly returning the indices \( 0 \) and \( 1 \).
   - For \( n > 2 \):
     - It initializes `max_index` to \( 0 \).
     - It iterates through all indices from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) and uses `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` to compare the bitwise OR results. If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to \( i \).
     - After identifying the potential `max_index`, it collects all indices \( i \) for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns `=` and stores them in `min_indices`.
     - It then finds the smallest index in `min_indices` that satisfies the condition `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i) == '='` for all \( i \) in `min_indices`.
     - Finally, it prints the result using `func_2(max_index, min_index)`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that it does not exceed the allowed number of queries (3n) and handles the constraints properly.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the required format for both queries and answers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \) within the given constraints. The steps are logically sound, and the code adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
