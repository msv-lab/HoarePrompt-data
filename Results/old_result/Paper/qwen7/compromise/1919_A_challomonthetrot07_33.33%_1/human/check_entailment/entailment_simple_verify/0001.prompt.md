You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5
    
    11 9
    
    83 91
    
    1032 9307
    
    839204 7281
    
    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on the input values of `a` and `b` for each iteration of the loop. The exact sequence of 'Alice' and 'Bob' will vary based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `T` times and `T` is an input from the user, the final output state cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b` for each of the `T` iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Handling Equal Coins:**
   - If `a == b`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because if both players have the same number of coins, Bob can always force a win by mirroring Alice's moves until Alice runs out of coins.

3. **Handling Single Coin:**
   - If `a == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can remove the last coin from her wallet and force Bob to lose.
   - If `b == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because Bob can remove the last coin from his wallet and force Alice to lose.

4. **Handling Odd Number of Coins:**
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because Alice can never win if she starts with an odd number of coins. She will always be left with an even number of coins after her move, and Bob can mirror her moves to ensure he wins.

5. **Handling Even Number of Coins:**
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can force a win by removing one coin and then mirroring Bob's moves.
   - If `a > b` and both are even, the program prints 'Bob'. This is incorrect because it does not account for all possible scenarios where Alice might win. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 2`, Alice can remove one coin and then Bob will be forced into a losing position.

6. **Default Case:**
   - The default case (`else`) prints 'Alice'. This is incorrect because it does not cover all scenarios. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 4`, Alice should lose, but the program incorrectly prints 'Alice'.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the default case and the handling of even numbers of coins need to be more precise.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and a <= b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
