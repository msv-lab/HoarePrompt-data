Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Handling Equal Coins:**
   - If `a == b`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because if both players have the same number of coins, Bob can always force a win by mirroring Alice's moves until Alice runs out of coins.

3. **Handling Single Coin:**
   - If `a == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can remove the last coin from her wallet and force Bob to lose.
   - If `b == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because Bob can remove the last coin from his wallet and force Alice to lose.

4. **Handling Odd Number of Coins:**
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because Alice can never win if she starts with an odd number of coins. She will always be left with an even number of coins after her move, and Bob can mirror her moves to ensure he wins.

5. **Handling Even Number of Coins:**
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can force a win by removing one coin and then mirroring Bob's moves.
   - If `a > b` and both are even, the program prints 'Bob'. This is incorrect because it does not account for all possible scenarios where Alice might win. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 2`, Alice can remove one coin and then Bob will be forced into a losing position.

6. **Default Case:**
   - The default case (`else`) prints 'Alice'. This is incorrect because it does not cover all scenarios. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 4`, Alice should lose, but the program incorrectly prints 'Alice'.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the default case and the handling of even numbers of coins need to be more precise.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and a <= b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
