### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Handling Equal Coins:**
   - If `a == b`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because if both players have the same number of coins, Bob can always force a win by mirroring Alice's moves until Alice runs out of coins.

3. **Handling Single Coin:**
   - If `a == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can remove the last coin from her wallet and force Bob to lose.
   - If `b == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because Bob can remove the last coin from his wallet and force Alice to lose.

4. **Handling Odd Number of Coins:**
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because Alice can never win if she starts with an odd number of coins. She will always be left with an even number of coins after her move, and Bob can mirror her moves to ensure he wins.

5. **Handling Even Number of Coins:**
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can force a win by removing one coin and then mirroring Bob's moves.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0` and `a <= b`, the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because if both players have an even number of coins and `a <= b`, Bob can mirror Alice's moves to ensure he wins.

6. **Default Case:**
   - The default case (`else`) prints 'Alice'. This is incorrect because it does not cover all scenarios where Alice might lose. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 4`, Alice should lose, but the program incorrectly prints 'Alice'.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and a <= b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the default case does not cover all scenarios where Alice might lose. The corrected program addresses these issues.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
