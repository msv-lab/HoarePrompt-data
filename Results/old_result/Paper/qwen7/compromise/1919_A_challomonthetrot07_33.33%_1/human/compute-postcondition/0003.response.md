Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on the input values of `a` and `b` for each iteration of the loop. The exact sequence of 'Alice' and 'Bob' will vary based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `T` times and `T` is an input from the user, the final output state cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b` for each of the `T` iterations.
