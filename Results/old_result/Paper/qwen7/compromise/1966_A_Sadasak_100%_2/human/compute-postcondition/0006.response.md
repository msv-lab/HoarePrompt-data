Functionality: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It processes the list to create a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from `arr` and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` is capped at `k`. The function then returns this dictionary.
