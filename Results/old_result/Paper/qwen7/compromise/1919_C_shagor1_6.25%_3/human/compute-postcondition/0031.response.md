Output State: **`a` is the next element from `inp`, `x` retains its value, `y` is now equal to `a`, and `ans` retains its value.**

In this case, the code `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to `y`. The other variables (`x` and `ans`) retain their previous values. The statement `a` is the next element from `inp` is also kept as part of the output state since it was mentioned in the initial state and no changes were made to it.
