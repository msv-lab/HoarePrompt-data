Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer decremented by 1, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `x`, `inp` is a non-empty list, `a` is the first element of `inp`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a` (which is equal to `x`) to `y`. Since `x` is defined as `n + 1`, `y` is now also `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
