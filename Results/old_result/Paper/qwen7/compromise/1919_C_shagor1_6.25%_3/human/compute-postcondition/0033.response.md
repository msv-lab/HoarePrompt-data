Output State: **`a` is the next element from `inp`, `x` retains its value, `y` is `a`, and `ans` retains its value unless `x` is equal to `y`.**

In this case, the variable `y` is assigned the value of `a`. All other variables (`a`, `x`, `y`, and `ans`) retain their previous values unless `x` is equal to `y`, in which case `ans` would be updated.
