Output State: **`n` is an input integer decremented by 1; `x` is `y` which is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`; `ans` is the count of distinct minimum values in `inp` greater than `y`.**

Explanation: The code sets both `x` and `y` to the value of `n + 1`. The initial values of `x` and `y` were defined as the minimum value (`x`) and the second minimum value (`y`) encountered in `inp`, or `y` remained unchanged if no second unique minimum was found. After executing the code, `x` and `y` are both set to `n + 1`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
