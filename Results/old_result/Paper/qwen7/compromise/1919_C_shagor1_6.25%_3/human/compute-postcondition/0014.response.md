Output State: **`a` is greater than `x`, `a` is greater than `y`, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is equal to `a`**

Explanation: The code `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, and initially `x` is equal to `y`, after the assignment, `y` will now hold the value of `a`. Therefore, `a` remains greater than `x` and `y`, and `x` remains equal to `y`.
