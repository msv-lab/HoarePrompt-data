Postcondition: `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the relationship between the first element `a` of the non-empty list `inp` and `y`. If `a <= y`, then `ans` is 0 or 1, where `ans` is 0 if the original condition was not met and 1 if it was. If `a > y`, then `ans` is 2. Additionally, `n` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n - 1`, and `y` is now equal to `a`, with `a` being the next element in the list `inp`.
