Output State: **`a` is greater than `x`, `a` is greater than `y`, `x` is equal to `y`.**

The code `x == y` checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `x` and `y`, the only thing we can determine is that `x` is now equal to `y`. The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` relationships remain as per the initial state.
