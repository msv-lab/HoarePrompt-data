Output State: **`ans` is 1, `n` is an input integer decremented by 1, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `x`, `inp` is a non-empty list, `a` is the first element of `inp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 0, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `inp`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
