Let's reason through the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - This part is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program uses a predefined list `string.ascii_lowercase` which contains all lowercase Latin letters.
   - It calculates the lexicographically smallest word based on the given encoded value `n`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: `n > 52`
     - If `n` is greater than 52, it means the third character must be 'z' (since the maximum sum for two characters 'a' is 26, and adding another 'z' makes it 52).
     - The first character is calculated as `n - 53` (since the sum of 'a' and 'z' is 52, so subtracting 53 gives the position of the first character).
     - The second character is set to 'z'.
   - **Case 2**: `n > 26`
     - If `n` is between 27 and 52, it means the third character can vary from 'a' to 'z'.
     - The first character is always 'a'.
     - The second character is calculated as `n - 27` (since the sum of 'a' and 'a' is 26, so subtracting 27 gives the position of the second character).
     - The third character is set to 'z'.
   - **Case 3**: `n <= 26`
     - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it means the third character can vary from 'a' to 'z'.
     - The first two characters are both 'a'.
     - The third character is calculated as `n - 2` (since the sum of 'a' and 'a' is 2, so subtracting 2 gives the position of the third character).

4. **Output**:
   - The program constructs the word based on the above logic and prints it.
   - The logic seems to handle the different ranges correctly and should produce the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

### Testing with Provided Examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 24`
  - `24 - 53 = -29` (invalid, so use `24 - 27 = -3`, invalid again, so use `24 - 2 = 22`)
  - Result: `aav` (correct)
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 70`
  - `70 - 53 = 17` (valid)
  - Result: `rzz` (correct)
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`
  - `3 - 2 = 1` (valid)
  - Result: `aaa` (correct)
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 55`
  - `55 - 27 = 28` (valid)
  - Result: `czz` (correct)
- **Test Case 5**: `n = 48`
  - `48 - 53 = -5` (invalid, so use `48 - 27 = 21`, invalid again, so use `48 - 2 = 46`)
  - Result: `auz` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all test cases and produces the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded value.

**Correctness: True**
