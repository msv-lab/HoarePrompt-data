Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and printing their difference. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `l` is the length of the array.
   - `nums` is the list of array elements.

2. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - `x` is initialized to 0 and `y` is initialized to 100000000 (a large value).
   - The program iterates through the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values.

3. **Printing Result:**
   - The result is printed as `x - y`.

### Reasoning
- The logic of finding the maximum and minimum values and calculating their difference does not directly address the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
- The program assumes that the maximum difference between any two elements in the array will be the maximum possible beauty, which is not necessarily true. The beauty depends on the arrangement of elements such that the positive differences outweigh the negative ones.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:** 
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `3` and `1` respectively
  - Output: `3 - 1 = 2`
  - Correct Output: By rearranging to `[1, 2, 3]`, the beauty is `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `69` and `69` respectively
  - Output: `69 - 69 = 0`
  - Correct Output: The beauty remains `0` since all elements are the same.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `100` and `43` respectively
  - Output: `100 - 43 = 57`
  - Correct Output: By rearranging to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, the beauty is `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `4` and `3` respectively
  - Output: `4 - 3 = 1`
  - Correct Output: By rearranging to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, the beauty is `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `2` and `1` respectively
  - Output: `2 - 1 = 1`
  - Correct Output: By rearranging to `[1, 2]`, the beauty is `(2-1) = 1`.

### Conclusion
While the program correctly outputs the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values, it does not ensure that the beauty is maximized by rearranging the array. Therefore, the program does not fully solve the problem as required.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
