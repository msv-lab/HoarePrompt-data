Postcondition: `i` is `l`, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` remains the maximum value between the original `x` and `nums[i]`, and `y` is `nums[i]` since `nums[i]` is less than `y`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains as `l`, `e` stays at 2, and `l` is still greater than or equal to 1. The value of `x` does not change from being the maximum value between the original `x` and `nums[i]`, and `y` remains as `nums[i]` because `nums[i]` is less than `y`.
