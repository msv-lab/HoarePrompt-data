Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers split from the input.**

The code creates a list `nums` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `t` and `e` remain unchanged, and `l` retains its original value as an input integer.
