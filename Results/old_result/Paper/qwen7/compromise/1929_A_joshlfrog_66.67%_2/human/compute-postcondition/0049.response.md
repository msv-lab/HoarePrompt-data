Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is less than `l`.
   - `e` is 1.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `x` is the maximum value encountered in `nums` from index 0 to `i` (inclusive).
   - `y` is equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `l-1`.

3. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `l`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `l`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i < l` must still hold true for the next iteration.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `e` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `x` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the current value of `nums[i]`.
   - `y` will be updated based on the new value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`.

6. **New State**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `x` will be the maximum value encountered in `nums` from index 0 to `i` (inclusive).
   - `y` will be equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value encountered in `nums` from index 0 to `i` (inclusive), `y` is equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, and `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string.**
