Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `l`, `e` is `t-1`, `l` is the input integer, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `e` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The variables `i` and `l` will be as they are just after processing the last list `nums`. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the maximum and minimum values found across all the lists processed during the loop iterations.
