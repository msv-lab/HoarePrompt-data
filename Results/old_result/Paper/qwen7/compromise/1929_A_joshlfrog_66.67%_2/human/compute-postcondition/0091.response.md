Output State: **`i` is `l`, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the maximum value between the original `x` and `nums[i]`, and `y` is `nums[i]` because `nums[i]` is less than `y`**.

Explanation: The code `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Since `y` was previously set to be `nums[i]` when `nums[i]` was less than `y`, and now `y` is being reassigned to `nums[i]`, the condition that `y` remains as `nums[i]` because `nums[i]` is less than `y` still holds. The value of `x` remains the maximum value between the original `x` and `nums[i]` because no changes were made to `x` in this line of code. The values of `i` and `e` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The value of `l` remains greater than or equal to 1 as no changes were made to it.
