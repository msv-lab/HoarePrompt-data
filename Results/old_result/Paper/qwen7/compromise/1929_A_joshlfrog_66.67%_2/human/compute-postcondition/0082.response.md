Postcondition: `i` is `l`, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` remains the maximum value between the original `x` and `nums[i]`, and `y` is `nums[i]` since `nums[i]` is less than `y`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `nums[i] > x` is true or false, the values of `i`, `e`, and `l` remain unchanged, `x` stays as the maximum value between the original `x` and `nums[i]`, and `y` remains `nums[i]` because `nums[i]` is always less than `y`.
