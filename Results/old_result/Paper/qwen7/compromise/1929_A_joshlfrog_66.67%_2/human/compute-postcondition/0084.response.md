Output State: **`i` is `l`, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` remains the maximum value between the original `x` and `nums[i]`, and `y` is `nums[i]` since `nums[i]` is less than `y`.**

The code `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Since `nums[i]` is less than `y` (as per the initial condition), the value of `y` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `e`, `l`, and `x` remain the same as their initial conditions.
