Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list nums and y is the minimum value in the list nums)**

Explanation:
- `x` is defined as the maximum value in the list `nums`.
- `y` is defined as the minimum value in the list `nums`.
- The expression `x - y` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, the output will be the result of subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in the list `nums`.
