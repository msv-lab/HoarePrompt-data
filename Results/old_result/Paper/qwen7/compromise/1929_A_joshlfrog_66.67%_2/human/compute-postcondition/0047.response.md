Postcondition: `i` is less than `l`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value encountered in `nums` from index 0 to `i` (inclusive), `y` is either equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, or remains unchanged otherwise, and `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string.
