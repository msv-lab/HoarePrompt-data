Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `i`, `x`, and `y` are updated based on the new list `nums`. The initial values of `t`, `e`, and `l` remain unchanged, and `i` is set to `l-1`. The values of `x` and `y` are determined as the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`, respectively. The list `nums` itself is created but not explicitly shown in the output state.
