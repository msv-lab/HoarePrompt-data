Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is 100000000.**

The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `nums[i]` is greater than 0, `x` now holds that specific value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
