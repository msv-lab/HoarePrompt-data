Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, the input must also be within this range. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
