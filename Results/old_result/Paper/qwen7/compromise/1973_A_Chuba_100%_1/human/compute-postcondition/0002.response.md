Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either '-1' or a non-negative integer. The exact numbers depend on the input provided for each iteration of the loop. Each line corresponds to the output of one iteration of the loop, where the value printed is either '-1' if the sum of the three integers provided modulo 2 is 1, or half of the sum of the three integers minus the maximum of 0 and the third integer minus the first two integers, otherwise.
