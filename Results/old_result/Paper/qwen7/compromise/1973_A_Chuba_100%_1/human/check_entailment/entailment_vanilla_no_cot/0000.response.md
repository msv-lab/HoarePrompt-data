Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. Here’s why:

1. **Checking for Validity**: The condition `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1` is used to check if the sum of the scores is odd. This is not sufficient to determine if the scores are consistent. For instance, the scores `1, 1, 2` should be valid, but the current check would incorrectly return `-1`.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` is incorrect. It doesn't properly account for the number of games and the distribution of points among the players.

To solve this correctly, we need to ensure the following:
- The total points must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (in case of a draw).
- We need to distribute the points such that the differences between the scores can be explained by the number of games and draws.

Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of games needed
        min_games = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        max_draws = 0
        for i in range(min_games + 1):
            j = (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * i) // 2
            if i + j <= min_games and i + j >= 0 and 2 * i + j == p1 + p2 + p3:
                max_draws = max(max_draws, i)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This solution correctly checks if the total points are even and then tries to find the maximum number of draws that can explain the given scores.
