### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Score Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores (`v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is even. This is necessary because the total score must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (1 point to each in case of a draw).
3. **Invalid Score Configuration**: If the sum of the scores is odd, the program prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd total score cannot be achieved through the described scoring system.
4. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: This term ensures that the calculation does not go negative. If `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` is negative, it means the third player has more points than what can be explained by the first two players' scores alone, which is not possible without invalidating the scores.
     - Subtracting this term from the total points gives the minimum points that must have come from draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws because each draw adds 2 points (1 to each player).

Given the above steps, the program logic appears to be correct for the described problem.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles the constraints and logic for determining the maximum number of draws or identifying invalid score configurations.
