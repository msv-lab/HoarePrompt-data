Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and checks if their sum is even. This is a necessary condition because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, or 1 point to each player in case of a draw.
3. If the sum is odd, the program correctly prints `-1` indicating that the scores are inconsistent.
4. If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores should be covered by the draws and the remaining points should be distributed as wins and losses.
5. The program logic and the provided examples match, and the formula seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of draws.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
