Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is even. This check is necessary because the total score must be even since each game contributes either 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, or 1 point to each player. However, the current implementation only checks if the sum is odd, which means it will incorrectly print `-1` for sums that are actually even but cannot be achieved through the described scoring system.

2. **Calculation of Draws**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is incorrect. The program attempts to calculate the number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula does not correctly account for the constraints and possibilities of the scoring system. Specifically, it does not ensure that the calculated number of draws is feasible given the constraints of the problem.

3. **Handling of Constraints**: The program does not properly handle the constraints and edge cases, such as when no games were played (resulting in all zeros) or when the scores are inconsistent with the rules of the game.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
