Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the condition when `b <= a`. In this case, it sets `k` to 0, which means all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The formula used is `a * n`, which is correct because no buns are sold at the modified price.
2. When `b > a`, the program calculates the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the difference between `b` and `a`.
3. The profit calculation for `k > 0` uses the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This formula accounts for the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns sold at the modified prices and the remaining buns sold at the usual price `a`.

Given the logic and the formulas used in the program, it correctly implements the solution to maximize Bob's profit based on the conditions provided.

Correctness: **True**
