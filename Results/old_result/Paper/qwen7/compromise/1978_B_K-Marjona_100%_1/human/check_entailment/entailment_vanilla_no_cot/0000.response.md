Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input and calculates the value of `k` as the minimum between `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price while still being beneficial compared to the usual price.
3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means there is no benefit in changing the price, so all buns should be sold at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, the function calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

The formula used for the modified price is:
\[ \text{Profit} = b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

This formula accounts for the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` terms (which is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers starting from `b`).

Given the example inputs and outputs, the function correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
