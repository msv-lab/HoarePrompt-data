Output State: **`total` is 0, `cases` must be greater than 0, `na_frente` is the original value minus 2, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables (`cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
