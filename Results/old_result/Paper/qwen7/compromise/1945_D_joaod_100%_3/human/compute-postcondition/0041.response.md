Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v` is the original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to -1, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. In either case (whether we switch to `a` at position `v - 1` or pass through `b` at position `na_frente - 2`), `total` is incremented by the respective cost (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).
