Output State: **`total` is the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` for the current value of `v - 1`; `v` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `total` by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `v` is the original value minus 1, and it is greater than or equal to -1. After executing `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, the value of `v` is decremented by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `total` is now the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` for the current value of `v - 1`, and `v` is decremented by 1.
