Output State: **`total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v` is the original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to -1, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1; `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other conditions and comparisons mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, `total` now includes the cost of passing through `b` at position `v - 1`, while the rest of the conditions and variables retain their original relationships and constraints.
