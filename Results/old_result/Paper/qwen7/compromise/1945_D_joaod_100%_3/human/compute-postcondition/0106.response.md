Output State: **`v` is `v_prev - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Given the initial state, `v` is `v_prev - 1`, and `total` was previously increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 1]` depending on which one is smaller. Since the current code only adds `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to `total`, the updated value of `total` will be the previous value of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
