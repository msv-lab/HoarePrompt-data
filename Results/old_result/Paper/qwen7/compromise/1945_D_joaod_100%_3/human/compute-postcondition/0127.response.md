Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `v` will be -1, `pos_final` will be an integer, and `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration where `v` is within the range defined by `na_frente` to 0, inclusive. The variable `best` will hold the maximum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev]` whenever `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `v` will have reached -1, meaning it has iterated through all values from `na_frente` down to 0. The variable `total` will contain the accumulated cost based on the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration. The variable `best` will store the highest value calculated during the loop, which is the maximum of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev]` when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
