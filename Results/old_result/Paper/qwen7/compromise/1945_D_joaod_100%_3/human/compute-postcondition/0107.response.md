Output State: **`v` is `v_prev - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 1]`, `total` is further increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `v` is set to `v_prev - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer, and `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 1]` depending on which one is smaller. The code snippet updates `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Since `v` is already defined as `v_prev - 1`, the first part of the increase to `total` remains unchanged, and now `total` is also increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
