Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `v` is used in the loop condition and is modified within the loop.
   - There are no other variables directly controlled by the loop itself (like `na_frente`, `pos_final`, etc.), but these are referenced within the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `na_frente` down to `-1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `v` will now be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Since the loop runs from `na_frente` down to `-1`, if `v` is now `-1`, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `v` will be decremented by 1.
   - If `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`, the loop will continue. Otherwise, it will terminate.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- If `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`, the loop will continue.
- If `v` is `-1`, the loop will terminate.

Since `v` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, let's assume `v` was `v_end` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, `v` will be `v_end - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

If `v_end` was `-1`, the loop will terminate. Otherwise, `v` will be `v_end - 1`.

Let's assume `v_end` was `-1` (the loop would have terminated), then:

State: **`total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1` (which is -2), where `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. Since `v` is `-1`, the loop terminates.**

However, if `v_end` was greater than `-1`, then:

State: **`total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1` (where `v` is decremented by 1), where `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `v_end`, we'll consider the general case where `v` is decremented by 1.

State: **`total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1` (where `v` is decremented by 1), where `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1.**

Final Answer:
State: **`total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1` (where `v` is decremented by 1), where `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1.**
