Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `total` will hold the minimum cumulative cost from the starting position (`na_frente - 1`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step. The loop iterates backward from `na_frente - 1` to `-1`, updating `total` based on the minimum cost option at each step. The variable `best` will hold the lowest cumulative cost found during the entire process.**

This means that after executing the loop for all given cases, `total` will reflect the optimal path cost from the starting point to the end point, considering the costs associated with switching paths or passing through them, and `best` will store the minimum cumulative cost encountered throughout the iterations.
