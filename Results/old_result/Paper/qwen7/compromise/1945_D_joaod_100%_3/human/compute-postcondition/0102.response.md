Output State: **`v` is `v_prev - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]`, and `best` is assigned the value `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true. If the condition is false, `best` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code snippet `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increases the value of `total` by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `v` remains `v_prev - 1`, `pos_final` remains an integer, and `best` is updated based on the condition provided.
