Output State: **`total` is the updated minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value. The conditions and relationships between the variables `na_frente`, `v`, and `pos_final` remain unchanged.
