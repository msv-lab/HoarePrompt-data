Output State: **`total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v` is the original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to -1, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1; `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code increments `total` by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Since `v` is the original value minus 1 and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2, these conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `total` is the sum of its previous value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
