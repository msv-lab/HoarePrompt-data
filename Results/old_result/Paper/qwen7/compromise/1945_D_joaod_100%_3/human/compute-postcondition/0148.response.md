Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is an input integer that can take values from `na_frente` down to 0, `c` is 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is either 0 or updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is either the maximum floating-point value or updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and the current value of `v` is greater than `pos_final`.
