Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
