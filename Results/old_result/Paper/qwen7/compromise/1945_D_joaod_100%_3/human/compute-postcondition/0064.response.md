Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `c` in the range `range(cases)`. This means the loop iterates over the variable `c`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates backward from `na_frente - 2` to `-1`, updating `total` based on the minimum cost option at each step. However, the loop itself is controlled by the variable `c`, which is iterating over a range of `cases`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: Since the loop is controlled by `c`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `c`. At the end of the previous iteration, `c` would have been incremented by 1 (assuming it starts from 0).

4. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `c` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` should be set to the next value in the range.

Since the loop is iterating over `range(cases)`, the next value of `c` would be `previous_c + 1`.

Given that the problem does not specify the exact value of `c` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the previous value of `c` as `previous_c`. Therefore, the new value of `c` will be `previous_c + 1`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `previous_c`, we can generalize it as follows:

- `total` remains unchanged because the loop body updates `total` based on the current value of `c`, but `total` itself is not directly part of the loop head.
- `cases` remains unchanged because it defines the range of the loop.
- `c` is incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`total` holds the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 2`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step, `c` is incremented by 1, and `cases` remains the same.**
