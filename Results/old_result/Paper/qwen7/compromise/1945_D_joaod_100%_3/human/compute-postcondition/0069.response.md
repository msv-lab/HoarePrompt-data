Output State: **`na_frente` is `na_frente - 2`, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `c` is incremented by 1, `total` holds the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 3`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step, `cases` remains the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `na_frente` is updated to `na_frente - 2` (since it was already `na_frente - 1`), `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `c` is incremented by 1, and `total` continues to hold the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 3`) to the end position (`-1`).
