Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `c` is incremented by 1, and `total` holds the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 2`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step, and `cases` remains the same.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. It does not affect the values of `total`, `c`, or `cases`. Therefore, `total` still holds the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 2`) to the end position (`-1`), `c` is incremented by 1, and `cases` remains the same.
