Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions checked in the program are accurate:

1. `n >= m`: This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially add up to `m` cubes.
2. `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the difference between the initial and final number of cubes.

Given these conditions, the program will output "YES" if both conditions are met, and "NO" otherwise, which aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.
