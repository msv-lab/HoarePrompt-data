The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, which is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5 and the length of `s1` equals `n`. The function returns a value based on the relationship between the characters in `s1` and the integer `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` containing only '<' and '>', and an integer `n`. It returns a value determined by the balance of '<' and '>' in `s1` relative to `n`.**
