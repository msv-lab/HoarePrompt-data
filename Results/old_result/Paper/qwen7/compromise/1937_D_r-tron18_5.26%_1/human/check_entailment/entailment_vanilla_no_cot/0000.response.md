Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution seems to have several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to handle the logic required for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. The function `func_1` is trying to compute something related to accumulated values but does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Logic for Calculating Time**: The logic inside `func_2` is overly complex and does not correctly simulate the pinball movement and the inversion of directions. The logic for handling the pinball movement and direction inversion needs to be more straightforward and aligned with the problem statement.

3. **Accumulation and Preprocessing**: While accumulation (`accumulate`) is a useful tool, its usage here is not appropriate for the problem at hand. The problem requires simulating the movement of the pinball step-by-step, which is better handled through a simpler approach rather than complex accumulation operations.

4. **Edge Cases and Simplification**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the pinball starts from the boundary cells (leftmost or rightmost), where it would immediately leave the grid without any movement.

### Correct Approach:
A more straightforward approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position. For each cell, you can simulate the movement until the pinball leaves the grid, keeping track of the time taken. This can be done using a simple loop and conditional checks.

Here's a simplified version of the solution:

```python
def solve(s, n):
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        time = 0
        pos = i
        while 0 <= pos < n:
            time += 1
            if s[pos] == '<':
                pos -= 1
            else:
                pos += 1
            s = s.replace(s[pos], '>' if s[pos] == '<' else '<')
        ans.append(time)
    return ans

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = solve(s, n)
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This approach directly simulates the movement of the pinball for each starting position and calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. This should be more accurate and easier to understand compared to the provided solution.
