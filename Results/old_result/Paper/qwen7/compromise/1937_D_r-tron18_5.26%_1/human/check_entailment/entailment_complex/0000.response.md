### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell has a direction ('<' or '>'), and the direction changes after the pinball moves. The goal is to calculate how long it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list and another element based on the value of `times`. It is used to compute indices and differences within the main function.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. It uses several lists (`pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`) to keep track of positions and counts of '>' and '<' characters.

3. **Key Logic in Function 2**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `pre` with positions of '>' characters, `preOne` with cumulative sums, and `suffZero` with zeros.
   - **Loop**: The loop iterates backward through the string `s1` to calculate the time for each starting position.
     - For each position, it checks the direction ('>' or '<') and updates the indices and counts accordingly.
     - It uses `func_1` to compute necessary differences and indices.
   - **Output**: The result is stored in the `ans` list, which is printed at the end.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the movement and direction changes of the pinball.
   - The use of `func_1` ensures that the calculations are done efficiently.
   - The overall structure of the code matches the requirements of the problem, including handling different directions and updating the grid state correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided implementation appears to correctly simulate the pinball's movement and calculate the required times.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
