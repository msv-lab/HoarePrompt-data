### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. This part is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the total number of tents required.

3. **Handling Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:` checks if it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and some universals together. If this condition is true, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate everyone. This logic is correct because if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, then there won't be enough universals to pair up with the remaining extroverts.
   
4. **Calculating Tents**:
   - `k += a + (b + c) // 3`: This line calculates the number of tents needed for the introverts (`a`) and the groups of three people that can be formed from the extroverts and universals combined (`(b + c) // 3`). This part is correct.
   
5. **Adjusting for Remaining People**:
   - `if (b + c) % 3 != 0: k += 1`: This line ensures that if there are any remaining people after forming complete groups of three, an additional tent is needed. This logic is also correct.

6. **Output**: The program prints the total number of tents required for each test case. This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the logic for determining the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the participants according to their preferences. It also correctly outputs `-1` when it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Correctness:
**True**
