The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `k` based on specific conditions. If certain conditions are not met, it prints `-1` for that test case. The final output for each test case is the calculated value `k`.
