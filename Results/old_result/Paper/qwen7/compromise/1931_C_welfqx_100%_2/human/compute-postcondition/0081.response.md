Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for j in range(n - 1)` will execute as long as `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. This means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `j`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given the initial states:
- `r` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `f` is 1.
- `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.

We only need to adjust the states of `n` because it directly affects the loop execution.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`r` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string**
