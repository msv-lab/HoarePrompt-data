Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 2` (since it starts from `n - 1` and increments with each iteration until it reaches `n - 2`). The variable `cn` will be incremented each time `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`. The final value of `cn` will depend on how many consecutive elements in `num` are equal. The variables `j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, and `symb1`, `symb2` will retain their initial values unless explicitly changed within the loop, which they are not in this case.

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all iterations will be:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements in `num`
- All other variables (`j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
