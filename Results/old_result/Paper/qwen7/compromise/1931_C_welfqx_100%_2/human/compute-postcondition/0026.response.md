Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` must be 0, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, and `j` equals `n-1`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, and `j` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0, `r` must be 0, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, and `j` equals `n-1` remains valid after the execution of the `continue` statement.
