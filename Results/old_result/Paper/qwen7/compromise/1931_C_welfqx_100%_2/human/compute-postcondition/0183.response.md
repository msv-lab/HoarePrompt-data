Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 1, `onum` is a reversed version of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`**

The code assigns the value of `onum[0]` to `symb2`. Since `onum` is a reversed version of `num`, `onum[0]` is the last digit of `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.
