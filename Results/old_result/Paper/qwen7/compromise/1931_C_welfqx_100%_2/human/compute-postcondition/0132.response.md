Postcondition: `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array that allows checking consecutive elements without exiting prematurely, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`, and if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is increased by 1. If `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
