Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `r` must be 0; `n` is an input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `num`. The variables `t`, `r`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
