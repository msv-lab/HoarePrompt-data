Output State: **`r` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, the current value of `num[j]` is not equal to the current value of `num[j + 1]`.**

The code sets `f` to 0, which changes the value of `f` from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
