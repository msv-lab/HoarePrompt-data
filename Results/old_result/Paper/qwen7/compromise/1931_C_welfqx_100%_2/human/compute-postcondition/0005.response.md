Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since `j` starts from 0 (the default starting value for the `range` function), we don't need to change its initial value.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `n - 1` at the start of the loop.
4. **Initial values of other variables**: The variables `t`, `r`, `f`, and `num` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their initial states do not need to be changed.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `n - 1` at the start of the loop. Since `j` starts from 0, the loop will execute as long as `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop can execute.

The final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` must be 0, `n` must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces**
