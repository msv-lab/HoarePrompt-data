Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` will take values from `0` to `n-2`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1 (i.e., `n >= 2`).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 so that `range(n - 1)` produces at least one value for `i`.
   - The initial value of `i` will be `0` when the loop starts.

4. **List the Adjusted States**:
   - `r` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `f` is 1 (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `num` is a list of integers (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `j` is equal to `n - 1`, so initially, `j` should be 1 (since `n` must be at least 2).
   - `onum` is a reversed copy of `num` (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `cn` is 1 (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `ck` is 1 (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `symb1` is the first element of `num`, so it remains unchanged.
   - `symb2` is the last element of `num`, so it remains unchanged.

Given these points, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1**
