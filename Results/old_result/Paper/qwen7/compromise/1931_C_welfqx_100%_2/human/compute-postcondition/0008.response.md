Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` must be 0, `n` must be at least 2, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, and the current value of `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`**.

The value of `f` is explicitly set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial conditions. The precondition that `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` remains unchanged.
