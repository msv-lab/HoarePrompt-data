Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `ii` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - The postcondition states that if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ii` remains 2. Otherwise, we break out of the loop.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for ii in range(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `ii`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.

5. **Current Value of `ii`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 1.

6. **Condition Check**: Since `ii` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `ii` must be incremented to 2 (the next value in the range `range(n - 1)`).

7. **Postcondition Consideration**: The postcondition states that if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ii` remains 2. Otherwise, we break out of the loop. Given `ii` is 1, `ii + 1` is 2. Therefore, the condition `onum[1] == onum[2]` needs to be checked.

8. **State Adjustment**: If `onum[1] == onum[2]` is true, then `ii` remains 2. Otherwise, the loop breaks. However, since we are asked to consider the state before breaking, we assume the condition is not met and `ii` remains 2.

9. **New State**: After the loop increments `ii` to 2, the new state should reflect this change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
