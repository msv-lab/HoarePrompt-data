Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `ii` and the constant `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `ii` must be less than `n - 1` initially.
   - Since `ii` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `ii < n - 1`, the initial value of `ii` should be 0.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `ii` is initialized to 0.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial state because it is used as a boundary condition for the loop.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The variables `j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` are not mentioned in the loop head and are not being modified within the loop body, so they retain their initial values.

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`ii` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
