Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and `n`. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - The postcondition is that if `num[1]` is equal to `num[2]`, then `cn` is 1. Otherwise, the loop breaks.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`, and `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2 (if the loop continues).

4. **Check the Condition for Continuing the Loop**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is 1, the condition `i < n - 1` will hold true as long as `n > 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`.
   - `i` should be set to 2 for the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`num` and `cn`) are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2**.
