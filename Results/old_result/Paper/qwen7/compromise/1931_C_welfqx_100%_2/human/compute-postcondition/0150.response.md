Based on the initial state provided:

- `ii` is `n - 1`, meaning the loop has completed its checks up to the second last element.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `num` is a list or array where all elements from index 0 to `n-2` are checked for consecutive identical elements.
- `cn` is the total count of consecutive identical elements found during the entire loop execution.
- The loop has checked all elements up to the second last one, so `cn` represents the count of such consecutive elements found in the list.
- `ck` is not mentioned in the initial state, but it's used in the print statement. Since `ck` is not defined in the given context, we assume it might be another counter or a similar variable related to counting, but without further information, we treat it as an unknown.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(n - max(cn, ck))
```

Since `n` is at least 2 and `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements, and `ck` is not defined, we need to consider the maximum between `cn` and `ck`. If `ck` is not defined or not relevant, we focus on `cn`.

Assuming `ck` is not defined or irrelevant, the expression simplifies to:
```python
print(n - cn)
```

Since `n` is at least 2 and `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements, the output will be `n - cn`.

Output: **n - cn (where n is at least 2 and cn is the count of consecutive identical elements found in the list)**
