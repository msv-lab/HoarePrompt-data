Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` must be 0, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, and the current value of `num[j + 1]` is not equal to `num[j + 2]` which results in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, `f` is now 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or if statement it is inside. Therefore, the values of `t`, `r`, `f`, and `num` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `num[j + 1]` and `num[j + 2]` also remains valid.
