Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values of These Variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to `n - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` starts at `n - 1` and the loop continues as long as `j < n`, `j` will decrement in each iteration until it reaches 0. Therefore, `j` must start at `n - 1` and the loop will continue as long as `j` is non-negative.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is used as the upper limit for the loop.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `ii`, `f`, `num`, `cn`, `r`, and `t` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution condition. They can remain as they are.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` starting at `n - 1` and `n` being an input integer such that the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `n` must be a positive integer**
