Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `j` equals `n-1`, `onum` is a copy of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum = num.copy()` creates a copy of the list `num` and assigns it to the variable `onum`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
