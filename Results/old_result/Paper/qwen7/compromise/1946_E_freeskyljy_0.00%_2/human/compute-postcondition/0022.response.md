Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, either `L[0]` equals 1 or `R[0]` equals `N`. The condition `(M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]))` is false; `ans` is calculated as `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `L[-1] - 1` to the variable `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
