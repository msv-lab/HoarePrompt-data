Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, either `L[0]` equals 1 or `R[0]` equals `N`. The condition `(M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]))` is false; `ans` is calculated as `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is assigned the value `M1 - 2`. The values of `t`, `R`, `L`, `M1`, `M2`, `N`, `L[-1]`, `ans`, and the condition mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
