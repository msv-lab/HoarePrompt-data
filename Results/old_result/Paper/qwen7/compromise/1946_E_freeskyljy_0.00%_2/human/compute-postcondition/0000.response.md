Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N, M1, M2 are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `N, M1, M2 = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code execution. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are the integers obtained from the input.
