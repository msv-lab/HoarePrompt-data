Postcondition: **`i` is added to `s1` if it is in the alphabet, making `s1` equal to the first character of `s`. `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the length of the alphabet is not 1, then `i` is not in the alphabet and the length of the alphabet is `k-1`; otherwise, `s2` is a string containing the character `i`.**
