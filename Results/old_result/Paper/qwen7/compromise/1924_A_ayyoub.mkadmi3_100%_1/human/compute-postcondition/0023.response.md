Output State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet` plus the character `i`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k-1` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet) != 1`, otherwise `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `s2` is `s2` plus the character `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s2 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions. The value of `i` remains the same, `s1` still contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet` plus the character `i`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k-1` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet) != 1`, otherwise `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
