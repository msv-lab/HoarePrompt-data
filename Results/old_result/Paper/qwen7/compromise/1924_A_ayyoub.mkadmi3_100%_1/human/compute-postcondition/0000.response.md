Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`, and `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 1000`.**

The code initializes `s1` as an empty string, but does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `k`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
