Output State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet` plus the character `i`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `s2` is `s2` plus the character `i`.**

Explanation: The code creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This does not affect the values of `i`, `s1`, `s`, or `s2`. The set `alphabet` is updated to contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, which was already implied by the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state.
