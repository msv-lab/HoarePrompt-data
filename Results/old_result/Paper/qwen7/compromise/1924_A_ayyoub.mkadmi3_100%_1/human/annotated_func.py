#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s1` will contain all characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet`, `s2` will be an empty string, and `alphabet` will be a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet)` was not reduced to 1 during any iteration, otherwise it will be a set containing a single character.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the length of 's1' is greater than or equal to 'n * k', a substring of 's1' starting from index 'r * k' to the end, and 's2' as it is.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It filters `s` to keep only characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, constructs two new strings `s1` and `s2` based on this filter, and calculates a value `r`. Finally, it returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the original string `s2` unchanged.
