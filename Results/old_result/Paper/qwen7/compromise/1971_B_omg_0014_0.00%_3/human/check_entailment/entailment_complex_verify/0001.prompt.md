You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The output will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on whether the length of the set of characters in the input string `s` is 2 or not. If the length is not 2, it prints 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically sorted string or its reverse, depending on which comes first. If the length is 2, it directly prints 'NO'. The exact strings printed depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (number of test cases) and a string `s` (of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). For each test case, it checks if the number of unique characters in `s` is 2. If true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically sorted version or the reverse sorted version of `s`, whichever comes first.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - The program converts the string `s` into a set `a` to get unique characters.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 2, it prints 'NO'. This means if the string has exactly two unique characters, it cannot be rearranged to form a different string.

3. **Generating Different String `r`:**
   - If the string does not have exactly two unique characters, it prints 'YES'.
   - It then sorts the string `s` in both ascending (`b`) and descending (`c`) order.
   - If the sorted string `b` is the same as the original string `s`, it prints the reversed sorted string `c`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

### Testing the Program with Examples:

1. **Test Case: "codeforces"**
   - Unique characters: {'c', 'o', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'r', 's'}
   - Length of unique characters: 7
   - Output: "YES"
   - Possible output: "forcodesec" (as mentioned in the example)

2. **Test Case: "aaaaa"**
   - Unique characters: {'a'}
   - Length of unique characters: 1
   - Output: "NO"

3. **Test Case: "xxxxy"**
   - Unique characters: {'x', 'y'}
   - Length of unique characters: 2
   - Output: "NO"

4. **Test Case: "co"**
   - Unique characters: {'c', 'o'}
   - Length of unique characters: 2
   - Output: "NO"

5. **Test Case: "d"**
   - Unique characters: {'d'}
   - Length of unique characters: 1
   - Output: "NO"

6. **Test Case: "nutdealer"**
   - Unique characters: {'n', 'u', 't', 'd', 'e', 'a', 'l', 'r'}
   - Length of unique characters: 8
   - Output: "YES"
   - Possible output: "undertale"

7. **Test Case: "mwistht"**
   - Unique characters: {'m', 'w', 'i', 's', 't', 'h'}
   - Length of unique characters: 6
   - Output: "YES"
   - Possible output: "thtsiwm"

8. **Test Case: "hhhhhhhhhh"**
   - Unique characters: {'h'}
   - Length of unique characters: 1
   - Output: "NO"

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the cases where the string can be rearranged to form a different string and correctly identifies when it is not possible. The logic to check the length of unique characters and the sorting/reversing operations are implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**
