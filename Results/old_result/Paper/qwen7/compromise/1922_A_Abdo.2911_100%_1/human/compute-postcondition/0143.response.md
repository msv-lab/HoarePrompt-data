Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Understand the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 will make it 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified, so we keep the condition that `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
