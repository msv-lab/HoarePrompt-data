Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `possible`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as in the initial state.
