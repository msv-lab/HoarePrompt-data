Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `possible` remains `False` unless there was a condition inside the loop that made `possible` turn `True` for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. In that case, `possible` would be `True`.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer representing the number of iterations. The variable `possible` will remain `False` unless during any iteration of the loop, the conditions inside the if-elif-else statements caused `possible` to be set to `True`. If such a condition was met at any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, then `possible` will be `True`.
