Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string input by the user without any leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the string input by the user without any leading or trailing spaces, `c` is the string input by the user without any leading or trailing spaces, and the leading or trailing spaces of `c` have been removed.**

In this output state, the variable `c` now holds the value of the string input by the user, but with all leading and trailing spaces removed using the `strip()` method. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
