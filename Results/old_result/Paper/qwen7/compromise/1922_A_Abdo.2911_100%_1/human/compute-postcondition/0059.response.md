Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `possible` remains `False` unless there was a condition inside the loop that made `possible` turn `True` for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is some positive integer.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that:
   - If `possible` becomes `True` during any iteration (for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`), the state remains the same as the precondition.
   - If `possible` remains `False` after all iterations, the state also remains the same as the precondition.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.

5. **Adjusting States**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration.

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant value for the entire loop execution.

7. **Final State**: Given that the loop will execute one more time, the new state should reflect the updated value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `possible` remains `False` unless there was a condition inside the loop that made `possible` turn `True` for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`**.
