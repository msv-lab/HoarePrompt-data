Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and if the elements at index 0 of lists `a` and `b` are equal, `c[0]` remains unchanged and `possible` is False. If they are not equal, `c[0]` is neither equal to `a[0]` nor `b[0]`, and `possible` is True with the most internal loop or if statement broken out of.
