Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.
   - `b` and `c` are the stripped input strings.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`
   - This means `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current State:**
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i` has already completed all iterations from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because `i` is now `n + 1` and the condition `i < n` in the loop will fail.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and since the loop cannot execute again, no changes are needed for `i`.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop itself; it remains the same.
   - The value of `possible` remains unchanged unless there is an internal break or condition that changes it, but since the loop has completed, `possible` retains its current value.

5. **Final State:**
   - Since the loop cannot execute again, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`. `b` and `c` are the stripped input strings.**
