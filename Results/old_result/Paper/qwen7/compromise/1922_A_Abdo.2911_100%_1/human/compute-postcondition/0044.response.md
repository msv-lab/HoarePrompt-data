Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there was no loop specified in the initial state, we assume the context implies a loop where `i` and `n` are involved. After executing `continue`, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the loop continues with the next iteration.
