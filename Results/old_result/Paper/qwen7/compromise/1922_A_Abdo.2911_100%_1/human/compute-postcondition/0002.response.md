Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer before the code execution. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer, and `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user.
