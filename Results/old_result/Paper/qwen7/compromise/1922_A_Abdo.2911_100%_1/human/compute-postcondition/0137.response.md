Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`; `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the conditions related to the lists `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the variable `i` remain unchanged.
