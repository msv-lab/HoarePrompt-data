Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts integers t, n, and strings a, b, and c. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for t and n.**

To break it down further:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- It also accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- Additionally, it accepts three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- Based on the values of `t` and `n`, the function returns different outputs, though the specific outputs are not detailed in the given information.
