Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, and the current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c` within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged. The precondition remains valid as the `continue` statement does not alter the conditions specified.
