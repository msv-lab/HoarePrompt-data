Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - The loop condition is checked based on `i < n`

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer.

5. **New State:**
   - After incrementing `i` by `1`, `i` becomes `2`.
   - `n` remains the same (a positive integer).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer**
