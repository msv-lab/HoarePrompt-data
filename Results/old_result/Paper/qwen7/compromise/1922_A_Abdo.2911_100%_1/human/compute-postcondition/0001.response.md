Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given information, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input from the user.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, we can conclude that the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0)**
