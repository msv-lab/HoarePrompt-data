Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `possible` remains `False` unless there was a condition inside a loop that made `possible` turn `True` for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, it means the loop has completed without making `possible` `True`.

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
