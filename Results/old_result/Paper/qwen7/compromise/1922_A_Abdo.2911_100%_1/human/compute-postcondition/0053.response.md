Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `possible` remains `False` unless there was a condition inside the loop that made `possible` turn `True` for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. In that case, `possible` would be `True`. The condition `possible` is now being checked to be `True`.**
