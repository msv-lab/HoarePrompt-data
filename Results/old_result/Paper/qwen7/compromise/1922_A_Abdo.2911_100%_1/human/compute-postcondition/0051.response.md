Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `possible` remains `False` unless there exists at least one index `j` (where `0 â‰¤ j < n`) such that `c[j]` is neither equal to `a[j]` nor `b[j]` when `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `possible` will be `True` if there is at least one position where `a[j]` equals `b[j]` but `c[j]` does not match either `a[j]` or `b[j]`. Otherwise, `possible` will remain `False`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes, and no other variables outside the loop are affected.
