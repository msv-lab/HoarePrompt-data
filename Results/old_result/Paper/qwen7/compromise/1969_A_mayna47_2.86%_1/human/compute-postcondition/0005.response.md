Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is an integer read from input and the first element is 0, and `n` is greater than 2**
