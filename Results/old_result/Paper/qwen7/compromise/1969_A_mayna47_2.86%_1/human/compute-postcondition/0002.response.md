Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is an integer read from input and the first element is 0.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` integers from input and initializes the list `v` with a 0 followed by these integers. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `p`, and the structure of `v` remain unchanged except that `v` now contains the specified integers read from input as its elements starting from the second position.
