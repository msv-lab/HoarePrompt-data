Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a predefined set of inputs (t, n, p) where t is an integer between 1 and 5000, n is an integer between 2 and 50, and p is a list of n integers. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for t, n, and p.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters explicitly but works with predefined inputs `t`, `n`, and `p` that have specific constraints. It processes these inputs and returns a value according to certain conditions related to `t`, `n`, and the list `p`.
