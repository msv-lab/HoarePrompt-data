Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `p`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a mistake because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The variable `v` is initialized with zeros and then updated with the values from the input.
   - The input parsing logic seems to be incorrect. The line `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` is unnecessary and incorrect. It prepends a zero to the list, which is not needed.

4. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The special case for `n == 2` is handled correctly by printing `2`.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks for pairs where both friends in the pair receive invitations (`v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a pair exists, it prints `2` and returns.
   - If no such pair exists, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program should call `func_1()` inside the loop to handle each test case.

2. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The initialization of `v` should only be done once per test case, not before the loop.

3. **Logic for Pairs:**
   - The logic to check for pairs is correct. However, the input parsing needs to be fixed.

4. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The special case for `n == 2` is correctly handled.

5. **General Case Handling:**
   - The general case handling is almost correct but needs to ensure that the input parsing is done properly.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error due to the unused function `func_1()`. Additionally, the input parsing needs to be corrected. With these corrections, the program should work as intended.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be modified as shown above to be correct.
