Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the given information about the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.
   - `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
   - `k` is `k - s`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, we need to update these values.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `s` will be updated to the minimum value between `m` and `k - s` (from the previous iteration).
   - `k` will be updated to `k - s` (from the previous iteration).

Given the above analysis, here are the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `s` will be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s` (from the previous iteration).
- `k` will be `k - s` (from the previous iteration).

Since the exact values of `m`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we can represent them symbolically.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**
