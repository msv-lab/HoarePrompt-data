Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`
   - `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`
   - `k` is `k - s`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `(i + 1) + 1` to ensure the loop continues.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**New State**:
- `i` will be `i + 1` (from the previous state where `i` was `i + 1`).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `(i + 1) + 1`.

Since the exact values of `i` and `n` are not provided, we can express the new state as follows:

State: **`c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is `i + 1 + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`**.

Simplifying the expression for `i`:
- `i` is now `i + 2`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`**.
