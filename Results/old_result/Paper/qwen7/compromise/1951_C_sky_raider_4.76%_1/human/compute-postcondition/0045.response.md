Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
