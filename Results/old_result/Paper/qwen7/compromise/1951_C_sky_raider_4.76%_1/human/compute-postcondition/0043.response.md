Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = int(input()) - 1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop will stop when `i` reaches `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the final state**:
   - The final value of `i` will be `int(input())`, and `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to `n`.
   - This means that the loop will have completed all its iterations when `i` equals `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will stop when `i` equals `int(input())`, we need to set `i` to `int(input())`.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the final state of the loop) should be:

**State: **`i` is `int(input())`, and `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to `n`**.
