Output State: **`c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`, `k` is decreased by `s`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= s` decreases the value of `k` by `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
