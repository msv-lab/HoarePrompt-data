Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `c` is `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1 (as it was at the end of the previous iteration).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - The value of `c` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
