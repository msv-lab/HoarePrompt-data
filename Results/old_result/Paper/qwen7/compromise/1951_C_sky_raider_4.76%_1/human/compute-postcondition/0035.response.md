Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`
   - `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`
   - `k` is `k - s`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration as it is a condition for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1` (from the previous `i + 1`).
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`**.
