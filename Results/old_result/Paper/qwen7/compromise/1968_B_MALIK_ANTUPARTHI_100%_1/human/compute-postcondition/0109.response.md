Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is as follows:
   - `k` and `j` are indices.
   - If `d[j]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to the position of `d[j]` starting from index `k` in the list `e`, plus 1.
   - If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
   - If `d[j]` is not found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to `j`, and `j` retains its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(b):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `j` in the range `range(b)`, the variable `j` will take on values from `0` to `b-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

5. **Current Values**:
   - From the postcondition, we know the current value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration. Let's denote it as `j_current`.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j_current + 1`.

7. **Final State**:
   - The state at the start of the next iteration will be: `j` is `j_current + 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is `j_current + 1`**
