Output State: **`j` is equal to `b-1`, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `j`, `i` is `b`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `b` must be greater than 0, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`**.

Explanation: The code `k = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is `b-1`) to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
