Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1 or 2.
   - `b` is greater than 0.
   - If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, `j` remains 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(b):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
   - The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `b`.

4. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - If `j` is 1 or 2 and does not equal `b - 1`, the loop continues.
   - Since `b` is greater than 0, `range(b)` will include all integers from 0 to `b-1`.

5. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is 1 or 2.
   - `b` is greater than 0.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - If `j` is 1, it will increment to 2 (since `range(b)` includes all integers up to `b-1`).
   - If `j` is 2, it will increment to 3, but since `range(b)` stops at `b-1`, this would cause an error if `b` is 2 or less. However, since `b` is greater than 0, it means `b` is at least 3, allowing `j` to reach 3 without breaking the loop.

7. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - If `j` is 1, it will become 2.
   - If `j` is 2, it will become 3, but we need to ensure `b` is at least 3 to avoid an error.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`j` is 2, `b` is greater than 0**
