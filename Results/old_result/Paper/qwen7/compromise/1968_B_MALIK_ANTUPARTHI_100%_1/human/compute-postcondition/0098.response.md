Postcondition: `j` is 0, `b` is greater than 0, `i` is `b + 1`, and `k` is either `j + 1 + k` or 0, depending on whether `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` or not. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, the loop or if statement is continued with the original value of `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, the loop or if statement is broken and `k` is set to 0.
