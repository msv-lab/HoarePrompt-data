Output State: **`j` is equal to `b-1`, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `i` is `b`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string**.

Explanation: The line `k = 0` assigns the value `0` to `k`. The value of `j` remains `b-1`, `b` remains an input integer, `c` remains an input integer, `i` remains `b`, `d` remains an input string, and `e` remains an input string.
