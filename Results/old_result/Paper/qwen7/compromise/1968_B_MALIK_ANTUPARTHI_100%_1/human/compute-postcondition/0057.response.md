Postcondition: `j` is either 1 or `b - 1`, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` equals `c`, `i` is `b`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and the most internal loop or if statement has been exited. If the character `d[j]` is found in the substring `e[k:]`, `j` is set to either 1 or `b - 1`. Otherwise, `j` remains at `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
