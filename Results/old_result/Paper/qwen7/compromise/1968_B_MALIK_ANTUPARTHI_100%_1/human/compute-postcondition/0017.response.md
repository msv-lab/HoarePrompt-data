Postcondition: `j` is 0, `b` is greater than 0, and `k` is either 1 (if the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is true) or `k` is set to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` (if the condition is false). If the element `d[j]` is not in the slice `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 0 and the loop or if statement is exited.
