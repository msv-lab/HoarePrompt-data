Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the median might be a value that needs to be incremented to a unique value higher than the current median. Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the array `[5, 5, 5, 4, 5]`. The median of this array is `5`. According to the problem description, we need to increment elements to make the median greater than the current median. The program incorrectly counts the number of elements equal to the median without ensuring that the median itself is incremented to a unique value.

A correct approach would involve finding the median and then determining how many increments are needed to make the median a unique value that is greater than the current median. The program should ensure that after the increments, the new median is strictly greater than the old median.

Here's a counterexample:
- Input: `5 5 5 4 5`
- Expected Output: `3` (as explained in the example provided)
- Program Output: `3`

However, the program does not handle cases where the median is not incremented to a unique value. For instance, in the array `[5, 5, 5, 4, 5]`, the program counts the number of `5`s but does not ensure that the median is incremented to a unique value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
