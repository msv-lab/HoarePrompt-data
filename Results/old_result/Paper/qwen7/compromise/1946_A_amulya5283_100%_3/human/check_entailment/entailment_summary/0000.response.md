Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The program incorrectly identifies the median by counting occurrences of the middle element(s) in the sorted array. This approach does not ensure that the median value itself is increased to a higher value with the minimum number of operations.

2. **Logic for Increasing Median**: To increase the median, we need to focus on the middle element(s) of the sorted array. If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The goal is to make the median strictly greater than its current value with the minimum number of operations.

3. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation simply counts how many times the middle element appears in the sorted array. This does not guarantee that the median will be increased to a higher value with the minimum number of operations. For example, if the middle element is already the maximum value in the array, no operations would be needed, but the current code would still output a non-zero count.

4. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve:
   - Sorting the array.
   - Identifying the median position(s).
   - Determining the smallest value that is greater than the current median.
   - Calculating the number of operations needed to change the median to this value.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
