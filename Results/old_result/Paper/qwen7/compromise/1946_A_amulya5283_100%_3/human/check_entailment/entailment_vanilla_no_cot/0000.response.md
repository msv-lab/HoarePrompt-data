Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The logic in the loop where it tries to increment elements to match the median is flawed. Specifically, it counts how many times the median value appears after the median index, which does not guarantee the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:

1. Find the median of the array.
2. Determine how many operations are needed to make the median strictly greater than its current value.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate the median index
        mdx = n // 2
        
        # If the array has an odd number of elements, consider the middle element
        if n % 2 == 1:
            target_median = a[mdx]
        else:
            # For even number of elements, consider the average of the two middle elements
            target_median = (a[mdx - 1] + a[mdx]) / 2
        
        # Count how many operations are needed to make the median strictly greater
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] <= target_median:
                res += 1
        
        # Since we want the median to be strictly greater, we need to ensure
        # that the number of elements less than or equal to the target median
        # is strictly less than half of the array size.
        if res >= (n + 1) // 2:
            res -= (n + 1) // 2
        
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected program should provide the right number of operations needed to increase the median of the array.
