Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(mdx, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mdx`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `res` is updated based on the condition `a[mdx] == a[i]`
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input
   - `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `mdx` and goes up to `n-1` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1`.
   - Since `mdx` does not change within the loop, `mdx` remains the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `mdx` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` changes to `n - 1`.
   - `res` remains the same unless the condition `a[mdx] == a[i]` is met, but since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute, we assume no change in `res`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is `res + 1` if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `res` remains the same, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, and `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.**
