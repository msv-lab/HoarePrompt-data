Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) that are equal to `a[mdx]`, `n` is now an integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, updating the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
