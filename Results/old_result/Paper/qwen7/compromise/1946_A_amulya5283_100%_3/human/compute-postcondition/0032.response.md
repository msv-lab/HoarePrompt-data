Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` (excluding `a[mdx]` itself)**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. All other variables (`t`, `mdx`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is defined as the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` (excluding `a[mdx]` itself), but this calculation has not been performed yet.
