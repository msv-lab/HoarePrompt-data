Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any number other than 1, it would not satisfy both conditions simultaneously (it cannot be greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` at the same time unless `t` is 1).
- `n` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. However, since no specific input string is provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `a`.

Given this information, the `print(1)` statement will simply print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
