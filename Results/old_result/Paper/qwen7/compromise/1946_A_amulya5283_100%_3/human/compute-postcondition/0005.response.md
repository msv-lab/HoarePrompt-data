Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in the list `a`, we know that after sorting, `a` will be a sorted version of the list it originally was. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
