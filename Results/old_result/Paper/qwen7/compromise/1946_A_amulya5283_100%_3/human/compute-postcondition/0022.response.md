Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the range for `i` as `range(mdx, n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
   - `i` is `mdx + 1`
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`
   - `n` is an integer not equal to 1 with `mdx < n`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `mdx` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from `mdx + 1` in the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `mdx` remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop.

5. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `mdx + 2`.

6. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` starts at `mdx + 1` and is incremented by 1 each time, the condition `mdx + 2 < n` must hold true.

7. **State the new conditions**:
   - `mdx` remains `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
   - `i` becomes `mdx + 2`
   - `res` remains unchanged unless `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]` in the next iteration
   - `n` remains unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, and `n` is an integer not equal to 1 with `mdx < n`**
