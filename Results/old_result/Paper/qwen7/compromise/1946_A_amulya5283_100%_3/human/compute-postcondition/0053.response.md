Postcondition: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` contains the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` (excluding `a[mdx]` itself). The list `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input. If `n` equals 1, `res` is 0. Otherwise, `res` is the count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
