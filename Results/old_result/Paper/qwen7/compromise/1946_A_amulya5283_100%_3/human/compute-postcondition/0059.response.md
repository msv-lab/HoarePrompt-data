Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) that are equal to `a[mdx]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mdx` is still `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is still the count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `res` is preserved, but now `a` is sorted.
