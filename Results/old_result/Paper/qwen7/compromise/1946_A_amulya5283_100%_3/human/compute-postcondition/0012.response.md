Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expressions `mdx` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(mdx, n):` will execute if `mdx` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `mdx < n`.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`: This condition seems contradictory unless `t` is specifically set to 1 (since `t > 0` and `t == t - 1` implies `t = 1`). However, this detail is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `n` is an integer and `n` is not equal to 1: This means `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer: This is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `res` is 0: This is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`: We need to evaluate this expression to determine its value relative to `n`.

4. **Evaluate `mdx`**:
   - `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
   - For even `n`, `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n % 2` is 0.
     - Therefore, `mdx = n // 2 + 0 - 1 = n // 2 - 1`.
   - For odd `n`, `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n % 2` is 1.
     - Therefore, `mdx = n // 2 + 1 - 1 = n // 2`.

5. **Ensure `mdx < n`**:
   - For even `n`, `mdx = n // 2 - 1`, which is always less than `n`.
   - For odd `n`, `mdx = n // 2`, which is also less than `n` because `n // 2` is strictly less than `n`.

Given these evaluations, the only state that needs adjustment to ensure the loop can execute is ensuring `mdx < n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `n` is an integer and `n` is not equal to 1, and `mdx < n`**
