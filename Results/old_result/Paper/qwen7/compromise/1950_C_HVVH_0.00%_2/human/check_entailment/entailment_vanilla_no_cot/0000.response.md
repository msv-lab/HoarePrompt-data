Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight (00:00):**
   - The program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12, which should be 'AM'.
   - For `00:00`, the program prints "12:00 AM", which is correct, but the logic inside the loop is flawed.

2. **General Logic Flaw:**
   - The logic for determining whether the time is AM or PM is flawed. Specifically, it does not correctly handle times between 12 and 23.
   - The condition `if h > 12:` is incorrect because there are no hours greater than 12 in a 24-hour clock.

3. **Improper Conversion for Hours:**
   - The conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format is not handled properly. For example, `13:00` should be `01:00 PM`, but the current logic does not account for this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
        if h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM' if h < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the time is correctly converted to 12-hour format and the AM/PM indicator is set appropriately.
