Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. It then adjusts the hour based on whether it is in the AM or PM period:
   - If the hour is 0, it sets the hour to 12 and keeps the day as 'AM'.
   - If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it sets the day to 'PM'. If the hour is 12, it changes the day back to 'AM'.
4. It prints the adjusted time in the format `hh:mm` followed by the appropriate AM/PM designation.
5. The logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format is correct, and the program handles all edge cases (e.g., 00:00, 12:00, 23:59) appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
