Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`.
   - The number of test cases `n` is read from the input.
   
2. **Loop through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the time in 24-hour format (`hh:mm`) is read.
   - The time is split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), both converted to integers using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

3. **Convert 24-Hour Format to 12-Hour Format**:
   - If `h` is `0`, it is set to `12` and `day` remains `'AM'`.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it is adjusted by subtracting `12` and `day` is set to `'PM'`.
   - Otherwise, `day` is set to `'PM'`. However, this logic is flawed because:
     - When `h` is `12`, it should remain `'PM'`.
     - When `h` is `1`, it should still be `'AM'`, but the current logic incorrectly sets it to `'PM'`.

4. **Print the Result**:
   - The formatted time and `day` are printed.

### Issues Identified

- The logic for setting `day` when `h` is `12` is incorrect. It should remain `'PM'` instead of being set to `'AM'`.
- The logic for handling `h` values between `1` and `11` needs to correctly set `day` to `'AM'`.

### Corrected Logic

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
        if h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion

The original program has an issue with how it handles the `12` hour case and the transition between `AM` and `PM`. The corrected version ensures that the `day` is set correctly based on the hour value.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
