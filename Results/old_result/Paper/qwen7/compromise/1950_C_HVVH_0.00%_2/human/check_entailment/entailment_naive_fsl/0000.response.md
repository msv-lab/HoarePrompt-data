Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12 correctly. According to the problem description, when the hour is 12 in 24-hour format, it should be represented as "12:xx AM" in 12-hour format. However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' when the hour is 12, which results in incorrect output for times like "12:00".

For example, if the input is "12:00", the program will output "12:00 PM" instead of "12:00 AM".
