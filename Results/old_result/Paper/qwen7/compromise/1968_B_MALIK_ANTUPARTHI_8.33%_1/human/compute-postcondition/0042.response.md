Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user**.

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged from their previous states.
