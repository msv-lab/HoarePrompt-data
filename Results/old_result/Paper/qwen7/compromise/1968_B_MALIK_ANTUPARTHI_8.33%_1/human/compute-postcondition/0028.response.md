Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d` (with `j + 1` if `j < b - 1`), and `e` is a list. If `d[j]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, `k` is set to the position where `d[j]` is found or `c` if `d[j]` is not found. If `j` reaches `b - 1`, `j` remains `b - 1`. In either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
