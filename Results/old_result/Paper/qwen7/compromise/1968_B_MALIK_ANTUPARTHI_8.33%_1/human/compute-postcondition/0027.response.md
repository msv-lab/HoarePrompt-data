Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d` that is `j + 1` (if `j < b - 1`), and `e` is a list. If `d[j]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is equal to `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
