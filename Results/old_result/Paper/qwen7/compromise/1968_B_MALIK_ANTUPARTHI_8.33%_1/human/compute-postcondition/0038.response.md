Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index such that if `j < b - 1`, `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` remains `b - 1`. `k` is an index such that if `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to the first index where `d[j]` is found; otherwise, `k` retains its original value or is set to `j` depending on the if-else condition, and the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
