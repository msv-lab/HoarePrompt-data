Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input after splitting, `c` is the second integer input after splitting, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d`, and `e` is a list. If the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` holds true, the value of `d[j]` remains unchanged and is still present at index `k` in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of the list. If the condition does not hold, `d[j]` is not in the sublist `e[k:]`, `k` is equal to `j`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d` (with `j + 1` if `j < b - 1`), and `e` is a list. If `d[j]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, `k` is set to the position where `d[j]` is found or `c` if `d[j]` is not found. If `j` reaches `b - 1`, `j` remains `b - 1`. In either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index such that if `j < b - 1`, `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` remains `b - 1`. `k` is an index such that if `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to the first index where `d[j]` is found; otherwise, `k` retains its original value or is set to `j` depending on the if-else condition, and the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
