Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is e.index(d[1]) + 2**

Explanation: The value of `j` is 1, and `k` is initially set to `e.index(d[1]) + 1`. After executing `k = j + 1`, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[1]) + 2`. The precondition that `b` must be greater than 0 and the value of `j` being 1 remain unchanged.
