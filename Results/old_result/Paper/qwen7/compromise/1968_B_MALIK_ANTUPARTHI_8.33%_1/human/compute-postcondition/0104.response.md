Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is e.index(d[1]) + 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `b`, `j`, or `k`. It simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
