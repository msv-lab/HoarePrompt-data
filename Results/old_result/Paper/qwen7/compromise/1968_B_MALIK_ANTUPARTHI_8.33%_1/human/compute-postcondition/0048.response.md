Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of the character at index 0 of `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index 0 plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` finds the index of the character at index `j` (which is 0) of the string `d` within the substring of `e` starting from index `k` (which is 0), and then increments `k` by 1. Since `j` is 0, it finds the index of the first character of `d` in `e` and adds 1 to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
