Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `k` is either 1 (if the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is true, breaking out of the loop), or `k` is `e.index(d[0]) + 1` (if the condition is false). If the if condition is not met, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is either `e.index(d[1]) + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `k` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2. If `d[2]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `e.index(d[2]) + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[2]` is not found in the sublist `e[k:]`, `k` remains 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
