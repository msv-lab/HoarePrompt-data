Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `k` is updated to the index of `d[2]` in `e` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, `k` is updated to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
