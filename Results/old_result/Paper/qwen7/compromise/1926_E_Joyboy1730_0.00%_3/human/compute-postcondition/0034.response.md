Output State: **`pow` is multiplied by 2, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer minus `tot`, `L` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `m` is equal to 1, and `tot` is increased by `a`.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, `m`, and `tot`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
