Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a non-empty list, `m` is equal to 1, `tot` is less than or equal to `k`, `pow` is 1, and either `tot` is already greater than or equal to `k` or `tot` is updated to `tot + L[0]` and the first element of `L` is processed (i.e., removed or modified as per the operation inside the loop or if statement).
