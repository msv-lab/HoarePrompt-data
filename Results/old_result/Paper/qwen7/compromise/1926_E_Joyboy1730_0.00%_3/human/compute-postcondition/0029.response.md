Output State: **`pow` is multiplied by 2, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer minus `tot`, `L` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `m` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their initial states.
