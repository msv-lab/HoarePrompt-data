Output State: **`pow` is multiplied by 2, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer minus `tot`, `L` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `m` is equal to 1, and `tot` is increased by `a`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= tot` subtracts the value of `tot` from `k`. The other variables (`pow`, `n`, `L`, `m`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
