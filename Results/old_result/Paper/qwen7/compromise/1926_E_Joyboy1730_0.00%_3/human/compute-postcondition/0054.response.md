Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is (n + 1) // 2, `tot` is 0, and n must be greater than 1.**

The code `m = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the value of `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is updated accordingly, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the calculation of `m`.
