Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `L` must contain at least one element.
   - `pow` is set to 4.
   - `tot` is increased by the next element in `L`.
   - `k` is decreased by the new value of `tot`.
   - `m` and `n` remain unchanged.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to figure out the values of `pow`, `k`, and the expression `2 * k - 1`.

- `pow` is explicitly given as 4.
- `k` is decreased by the new value of `tot`. Since `tot` is increased by the next element in `L`, let's denote the next element in `L` as `L[0]` (assuming `L` has at least one element). Therefore, `tot = L[0]` and `k = k - tot = k - L[0]`.
- The expression `2 * k - 1` becomes `2 * (k - L[0]) - 1`.

Since `k` and `L[0]` are not explicitly given, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that `k` is adjusted by subtracting `L[0]` from it. 

Given the information, the print statement will evaluate to `4 * (2 * (k - L[0]) - 1)`.

Output: **4 * (2 * (k - L[0]) - 1)**
