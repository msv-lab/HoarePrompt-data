Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `L` is a list with at least one element. The exact elements of `L` are not specified, so we don't need to consider them for this particular print statement.
   - `tot` is 0. This variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
   - `k` is `k`. The value of `k` is not specified, but it will be used in the print statement.
   - `pow` is `pow * 2`. This means that `pow` has been updated to its original value multiplied by 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`.

Given the above, the expression inside the print statement is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`. Since `pow` is `pow * 2`, the expression simplifies to `(pow * 2) * (2 * k - 1)`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `(pow * 2) * (2 * k - 1)`.

Output: **(pow * 2) * (2 * k - 1)**
