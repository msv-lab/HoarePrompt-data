Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a non-empty list, `m` is equal to 1, `tot` is less than or equal to `k`, `pow` is 1, and either `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the first element of `L`, or there is no else part, meaning the conditions are not met.
