Postcondition: `L` must contain at least one element, `pow` is 2, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `tot` and `a`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `k` is set to `k - tot + a`, and `m` and `n` remain 0. If the condition `tot < k and k <= tot + a` is not met, `k` remains unchanged, and `m` and `n` remain 0.
