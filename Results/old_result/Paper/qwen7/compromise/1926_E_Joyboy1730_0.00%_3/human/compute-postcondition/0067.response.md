Output State: **`L` must contain at least one element, `pow` is 1, `k` is `k` - `tot`, `m` is 0, `n` is 0, and `tot` is equal to `tot` plus the first element of `L`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by the value of `tot`, which is the sum of the first element of `L` and possibly other elements (though only the first element is explicitly mentioned). All other variables remain unchanged.
