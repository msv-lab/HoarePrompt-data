Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to \((n + 1) // 2\)**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` was previously defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` simplifies to `n - m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
