State: **`i` is 0, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1 and `i` must be less than or equal to `j`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `i <= j`.
2. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.
3. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true.
4. Since `i` is currently 0, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Given that `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, this condition is already met as the length of any non-empty array is at least 1, making `j` at least 0.
5. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for `j`.

However, to ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to explicitly state that `i` must be less than or equal to `j`. This is already implied by the initial values but is necessary for clarity.

Thus, the final state is: **`i` is 0, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1 and `i` must be less than or equal to `j`**.
