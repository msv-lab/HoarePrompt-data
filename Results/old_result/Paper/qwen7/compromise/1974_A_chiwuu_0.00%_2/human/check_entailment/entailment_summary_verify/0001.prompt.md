You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( y \). For each test case, it calculates a value for \( t \) based on the given \( x \) and \( y \) values through a series of arithmetic operations. The final value of \( t \) is constrained between 1 and \( 10^4 \) inclusive and is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the calculated \( t \) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - If `t` is divisible by 5, it means the 2x2 icons can be perfectly placed without any extra space.
   - Otherwise, `t` is incremented by 1 to account for the remainder.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space to place all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens.

4. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - If there is not enough space (`t1 < a`), the program calculates how many more screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, representing the number of 1x1 icons that need to be placed.
   - The number of additional screens needed is calculated as `t2 // 15` (integer division) plus 1 if there is a remainder.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The total number of screens required is printed for each test case.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `t = 2 * 1 = 2`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a = 1`, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `a = 7`, `b = 2`
   - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, which is greater than `a = 7`, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `a = 12`, `b = 4`
   - `t = 2 * 4 = 8`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 2`
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`, which is greater than `a = 12`, so `t = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `a = 0`, `b = 3`
   - `t = 2 * 3 = 6`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 2`
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so `t = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - `a = 1`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 2 * 0 = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a = 1`, so `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - `t = 0 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - `a = 8`, `b = 1`
   - `t = 2 * 1 = 2`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a = 8`, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - `a = 0`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 2 * 0 = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - `a = 2`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 2 * 0 = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a = 2`, so `t2 = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - `t = 0 + 2 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

9. **Test Case 9:**
   - `a = 15`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 2 * 0 = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is less than `a = 15`, so `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`
   - `t = 0 + 15 // 15 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

10. **Test Case 10:**
    - `a = 8`, `b = 2`
    - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
    - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, which is less than `a = 8`, so `t2 = 8 - 7 = 1`
    - `t = 1 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 2`
    - Output: `2` (Correct)

11. **Test Case 11:**
    - `a = 0`, `b = 9`
    - `t = 2 * 9 = 18`, `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 4`
    - `t1 = 4 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 48`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so `t = 4`
    - Output: `5` (Correct)
