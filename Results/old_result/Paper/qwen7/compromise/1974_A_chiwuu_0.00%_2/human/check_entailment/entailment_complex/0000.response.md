Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It then processes each test case, reading two integers \( a \) and \( b \) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens**:
   - The variable \( t \) is initialized as \( b \times 2 \), which represents the number of 2x2 icons in terms of 1x1 cells.
   - If \( t \) is divisible by 5, it means the 2x2 icons can be perfectly placed without any leftover space. Otherwise, one additional screen is needed, hence \( t = \lceil \frac{t}{5} \rceil \).
   - Next, the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons is calculated as \( t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4 \). This represents the remaining 1x1 cell spaces.
   - If there is enough space to fit all 1x1 icons (\( t1 \geq a \)), no additional screens are needed beyond those already accounted for by the 2x2 icons.
   - If there is not enough space, the remaining 1x1 icons need to be placed on additional screens. The number of additional screens required is calculated as \( t2 = \lceil \frac{a - t1}{15} \rceil \).

3. **Output**:
   - The final value of \( t \) (total number of screens) is printed for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:
- For the first test case (1 1):
  - \( t = 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
  - \( t = \lceil \frac{4}{5} \rceil = 1 \)
  - \( t1 = 1 \times 15 - 2 \times 4 = 7 \)
  - Since \( t1 = 7 \geq 1 \), no additional screens are needed.
  - Total screens = 1, which matches the expected output.

- For the third test case (12 4):
  - \( t = 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
  - \( t = \lceil \frac{8}{5} \rceil = 2 \)
  - \( t1 = 2 \times 15 - 4 \times 4 = 22 \)
  - Since \( t1 = 22 \geq 12 \), no additional screens are needed.
  - Total screens = 2, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed based on the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
