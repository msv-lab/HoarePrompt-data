#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: `encoded` is an empty string, and `decoded` is a list containing all characters from the original `encoded` string, each replaced according to the `mapping`. If a character is not found in `mapping`, it is mapped to the corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' and added to `decoded`.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns an empty string since `encoded` is an empty string and there are no characters to map.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It maps each character in `encoded` to another character based on a predefined mapping. If a character is not already mapped, it is mapped to the next available character from 'a' to 'z'. After processing all characters in `encoded`, it constructs and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced according to the mapping. If `encoded` is an empty string, it simply returns an empty string.
