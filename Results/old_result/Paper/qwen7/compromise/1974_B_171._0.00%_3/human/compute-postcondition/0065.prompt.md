Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is now a non-empty string (two characters shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 2 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first two, has been appended to according to the `mapping`.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is an integer, and the character represented by `chr(c)` is now in the values of the dictionary `mapping`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is the ASCII value of the next character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z'. If the character represented by `chr(c)` is not in the values of the dictionary `mapping`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `c` is the ASCII value of a character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z'. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping[chr(c)]` is assigned the value of `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()`, nothing changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
