Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over characters from 'a' to 'z'. The variable used in the loop is `c`.
   - The loop starts with `c` being the ASCII value of 'a' and ends with `c` being the ASCII value of 'z'.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `c`:**
   - The loop starts with `c` as the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The initial value of `c` should be set to 97 (the ASCII value of 'a').
   - The other variables (`encoded` and `char`) do not affect the loop's execution since they are not used within the loop head.

4. **Final State:**
   - `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `char` is not in `mapping`.
   - `c` should be set to 97 (the ASCII value of 'a').

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to include the initial value of `c`.

**State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, char is not in mapping, `c` is 97**
