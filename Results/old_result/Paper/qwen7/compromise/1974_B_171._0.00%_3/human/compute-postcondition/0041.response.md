Output State: **`c` is 99; the character 'b' is not in the values of `mapping`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `c` or `mapping`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no such loop or if statement was provided, the values remain unchanged.
