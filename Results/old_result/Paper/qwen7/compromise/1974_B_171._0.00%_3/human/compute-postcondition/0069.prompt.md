Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `mapping` is an empty dictionary; `decoded` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in encoded:
    if char in mapping:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    else:
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                mapping[chr(c)] = char
                break
        decoded.append(chr(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `decoded` is a list where each character in `encoded` is replaced according to the `mapping`, unless a character is not found in `mapping`, in which case it is mapped to the corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' and added to `decoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is now a non-empty string (one character shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 1 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first one, has been appended to according to the `mapping`. If the character `char` is in `mapping`, the corresponding decoded character is appended to `decoded`. Otherwise, 'z' is added to `decoded` and `mapping` if it does not already exist.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is now a non-empty string (two characters shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 2 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first two, has been appended to according to the `mapping`, and `decoded` now contains one additional element. If the character `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` contains one additional element as per the mapping. If the character `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is equal to 122.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
