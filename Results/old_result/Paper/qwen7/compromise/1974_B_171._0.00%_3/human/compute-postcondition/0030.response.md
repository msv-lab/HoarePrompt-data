Output State: **`c` is 97, `mapping` is a dictionary with key 'a' and value `char`, the character corresponding to `c` is not in the values of `mapping`**.

Explanation: The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` assigns the value `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. Given that `c` is `ord('a')`, which is 97, the key in the dictionary becomes `'a'`. The initial condition that the character corresponding to `c` is not in the values of `mapping` remains true since no value was previously associated with `'a'` in `mapping`.
