Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `char` which iterates over each character in the string `encoded`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: Although the loop body is omitted, we know that for each character `char` in `encoded`, some operation is performed on `decoded`. However, the exact operation is not specified, but it does not affect the loop condition.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `encoded` to process. Since `encoded` is a non-empty string, the loop will continue until all characters have been processed.

4. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `encoded` is a non-empty string, and `decoded` is a list where each character in `encoded` has been processed according to the `mapping`.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next character from `encoded` needs to be processed. This means we need to remove the first character from `encoded` and add it to `decoded`.

6. **Adjusting the State**: 
   - The first character of `encoded` will be removed, reducing the length of `encoded` by 1.
   - The first character of `encoded` will be added to `decoded`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the removal of the first character from `encoded` and the addition of that character to `decoded`.

**State:**
- `encoded` is now a non-empty string (one character shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 1 \).
- `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first one, has been processed according to the `mapping`.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string (one character shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 1 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first one, has been processed according to the `mapping`.**
