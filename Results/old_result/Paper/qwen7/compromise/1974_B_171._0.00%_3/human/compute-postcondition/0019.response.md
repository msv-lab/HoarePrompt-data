Output State: **`c` is 100; `char` remains unchanged; `encoded` remains unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, the only effect is to indicate that we would exit such a block if present. All other variables retain their initial states.
