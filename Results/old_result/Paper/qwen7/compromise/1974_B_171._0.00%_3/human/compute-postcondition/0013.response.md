Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `char` is not in `mapping`.
   - `c` is 97.
   - Either `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, or `mapping['a']` is updated to 'a' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `c` was 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'.
   - The loop will continue to the next value of `c` in the range, which would be `ord('b') = 98`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over characters from 'a' to 'z', and `c` was 97 ('a') at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `c` will be 98 ('b').
   - The state of `char` will remain unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The state of `mapping` will remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop body is met, but since the condition is not specified in the loop head, we cannot assume any changes.

5. **Final State:**
   - `c` will be 98.
   - `char` remains unchanged.
   - `encoded` remains unchanged.
   - `mapping` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 98, and either `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()` (in which case no changes are made to `mapping`), or `mapping['a']` is updated to 'a' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
