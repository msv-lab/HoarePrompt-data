Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable in the given for loop is `c`.
   - The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means `c` will take values corresponding to each lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`:**
   - Since the loop starts iterating from `ord('a')` and goes up to `ord('z') + 1`, the initial value of `c` should be `ord('a')`.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `c` is within the specified range. Given that the range is from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, the loop will always execute because this range includes all values from `ord('a')` to `ord('z')`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `c`, and it needs to be initialized to `ord('a')` for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State:**
```
`c` is `ord('a')`
```

This ensures that the loop can start executing correctly.
