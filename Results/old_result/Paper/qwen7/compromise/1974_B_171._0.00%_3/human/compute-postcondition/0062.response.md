Output State: **`c` is the ASCII value of the next character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z', `mapping[chr(c)]` is assigned the value of `char', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `c` is being assigned the ASCII value of the next character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z', and `mapping[chr(c)]` is being assigned the value of `char`. The values of `c` and `mapping[chr(c)]` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
