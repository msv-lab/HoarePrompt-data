Output State: **The variable `c` will be 122 (ord('z')), and the character 'z' will be added to the `mapping` dictionary if it does not already exist in the values of `mapping`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character from 'a' to 'z'. After 26 iterations (since there are 26 lowercase letters in the English alphabet), `c` will be 122 (which is `ord('z')`). According to the loop condition, if 'z' is not in the values of `mapping`, it will be added as a key with any value (since the value is not specified in the loop body, it can be any value, but typically it would be the character itself). Since the loop will continue until all characters from 'a' to 'z' are checked and added to `mapping` if they are not already present, by the end of the loop, `mapping` will contain all 26 lowercase letters.
