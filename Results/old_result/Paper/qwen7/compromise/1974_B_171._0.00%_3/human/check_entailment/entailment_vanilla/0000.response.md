Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for decoding the string.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the reverse mapping of characters.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.

3. **Building the Reverse Mapping:**
   - For each character in the encoded string:
     - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it means we have seen this character before and know how to decode it.
     - If the character is not in the `mapping`, we need to find the corresponding character in the auxiliary string `r`.
     - To find the corresponding character in `r`, the program iterates through all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
     - It checks if the current letter is not already mapped to another character in the `mapping`. If it is not, it maps the current letter to the current character in the encoded string and breaks out of the loop.
     - After finding the mapping, it appends the current letter to the `decoded` list.

4. **Constructing the Decoded String:**
   - Finally, it joins the `decoded` list into a string and returns it.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction:**
   - The program attempts to build the reverse mapping by iterating through all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' and checking if the current letter is not already mapped.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the characters are mapped in the correct order as per the auxiliary string `r`.

2. **Incorrect Decoding Process:**
   - The program assumes that the first character in the encoded string corresponds to the last character in `r`, the second character corresponds to the second-to-last character in `r`, and so on.
   - However, the actual mapping should be based on the order of unique characters in the original string `s` when sorted alphabetically.

### Correct Approach

To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:

1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters of the encoded string in sorted order.
2. Create a reverse mapping from `r` to the original characters.
3. Use this reverse mapping to decode the encoded string.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        
        # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
        r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
        
        # Step 2: Create the reverse mapping
        mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
        
        # Step 3: Decode the string
        decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
        
        print(decoded)

```

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the original program, the corrected program should be used. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
