Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to decode the string but does not correctly implement the decoding logic. The issue lies in how the `mapping` dictionary is constructed and used.

In the given solution, the `mapping` dictionary is intended to map characters from the encoded string back to the original string. However, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly reverse the encoding process. Specifically, it tries to find the next unused character in the alphabet to map to the current character in the encoded string, which is not what is required for decoding.

To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:
1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` (which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s`, written in alphabetical order).
2. Create a reverse mapping of `r` to its symmetric character.
3. Decode the encoded string using this reverse mapping.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        
        # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
        r = sorted(set(encoded))
        
        # Step 2: Create a reverse mapping of r to its symmetric character
        reverse_mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i+1)] for i in range(len(r))}
        
        # Step 3: Decode the encoded string using the reverse mapping
        decoded = ''.join(reverse_mapping[char] for char in encoded)
        
        print(decoded)

# Example usage with the provided test cases
```

This corrected version constructs the auxiliary string `r` and creates a reverse mapping to correctly decode the string.
