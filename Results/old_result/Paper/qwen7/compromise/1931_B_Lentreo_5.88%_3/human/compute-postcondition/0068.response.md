Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `nums`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list.
   - If `i` is not zero, `curr` is updated to include the value of `i` minus the last element of the updated `nums` list.
   - If `i` is zero, `curr` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is being iterated over from the `nums` list, the value of `i` changes with each iteration.
   - The `nums` list is being updated during the loop, but the exact nature of the update is not specified. However, the postcondition implies that the last element of `nums` might change, and this could affect `curr`.
   - `curr` is dependent on the values in `nums` and the current value of `i`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `nums` for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` will be the next element in the `nums` list.
- **`nums`**: The `nums` list will be updated, but since the exact update is not specified, we assume it follows the postcondition logic. The last element of `nums` might change, which will affect `curr`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the `nums` list, and `nums` will be the updated list (with the last element potentially changed).

**Final State**:
State: **`curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list, if `i` is not zero, `curr` is updated to include the value of `i` minus the last element of the updated `nums` list, if `i` is zero, `curr` remains unchanged. `i` is the next element in the `nums` list, and `nums` is the updated list.**
