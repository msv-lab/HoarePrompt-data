Output State: **`t` is equal to its initial value minus 1, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is initially decreased by 1. The code then takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `n`. The value of `t` is updated, and `n` is set to the integer value of the input, while the initial state of `t` being decreased by 1 is preserved.
