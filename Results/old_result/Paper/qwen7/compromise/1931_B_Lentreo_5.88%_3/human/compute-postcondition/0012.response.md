Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in nums:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nums` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is an integer not equal to 0.
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is an element from the list `nums`, it will take on the next value from `nums` in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `nums` must still be a non-empty list, and `i` must be an integer not equal to 0.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `nums` must still be a non-empty list.
   - `i` will be the next element in `nums`, so it must be an integer not equal to 0.
   - `curr` is not directly part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `i` is an integer not equal to 0**.
