Based on the initial state provided:

- `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` that are not zero, with each element adjusted by subtracting the previous element in the list. Additionally, `curr` is not equal to 0.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the precondition does not provide any specific values for the elements in `nums` and only describes how `curr` is derived from `nums`, the content of the `print` statement is explicitly stated in the code snippet itself.

Output: **'NO'**
