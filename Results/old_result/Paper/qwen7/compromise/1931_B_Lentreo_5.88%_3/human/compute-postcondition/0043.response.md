Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `curr` is `curr` plus the difference between the current element `i` and the last element `last`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `curr` by adding the difference between the current element `i` (which is the next element in the list `nums`) and the last element `last` to `curr`. The list `nums` and the variable `last` remain unchanged from their initial state.
