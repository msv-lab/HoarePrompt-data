Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `i` is the second element of `nums`, `curr` is updated to the original value of `curr` plus `i` minus `last` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `curr` is updated based on the condition: if the second element of `nums` (which is `i`) is not 0, then `curr` is updated to its original value plus `i` minus `last`. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains the same. The lists `nums` and the variable `last` retain their previous values.
