Output State: **`nums` must not be an empty list, i is an integer and is not equal to 0, curr is curr + (i - last)**

Explanation: The code `curr += i - last` updates the value of `curr` by adding the result of `i - last` to its current value. Since the initial values of `i` and `last` are not specified, they remain as `i` and `last` respectively. The precondition that `nums` must not be an empty list and `i` is an integer and not equal to 0 remains unchanged.
