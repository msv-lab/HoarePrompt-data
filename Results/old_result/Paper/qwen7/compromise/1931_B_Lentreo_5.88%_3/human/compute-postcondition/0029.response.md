Output State: **`t` is equal to its initial value minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a line of input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The value of `t` is reduced by 1 due to the precondition, and `n` remains an input integer as stated.
