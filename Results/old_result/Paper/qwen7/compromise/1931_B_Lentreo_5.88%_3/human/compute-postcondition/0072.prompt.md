Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `curr` is 0, `last` is the last element of the updated `nums` list, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list.
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list. If the first element `i` of the `nums` list is not 0, then `curr` is adjusted by adding `i` and subtracting `last`. If `i` is 0, no adjustment is made to `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list. If `i` is not zero, `curr` is updated to include the value of `i` minus the last element of the updated `nums` list. If `i` is zero, `curr` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list. If `i` is not zero, `curr` is further updated to include `i` minus the last element of the updated `nums` list. If `i` is zero, `curr` remains unchanged. `i` is the next element in the `nums` list, and `nums` is the updated list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
