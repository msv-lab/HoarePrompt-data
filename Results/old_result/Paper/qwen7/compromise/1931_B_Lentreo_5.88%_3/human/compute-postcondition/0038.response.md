Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: 
   - `nums` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is the first element of `nums`.
   - If `i` is not 0, then `curr` is updated to the original value of `curr` plus `i` minus `last`.
   - If `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nums` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is the first element of `nums`.
   - If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to the original value of `curr` plus `i` minus `last`.
   - If `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first element of `nums`, for the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `nums`.
   - `nums` remains a non-empty list.
   - If the new `i` (which is the second element) is not 0, `curr` will be updated to the original value of `curr` plus the new `i` minus `last`.
   - If the new `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `nums` remains a non-empty list.
   - `i` becomes the second element of `nums`.
   - If the new `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to the original value of `curr` plus the new `i` minus `last`.
   - If the new `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `i` is the second element of `nums`, and if `i` is not 0, then `curr` is updated to the original value of `curr` plus `i` minus `last`. If `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.**
