Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three parameters: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (an integer between 2 and 10^8), and k (an integer between 1 and 4n - 2). It returns a value based on the conditions specified for n and k.**

This means the function indirectly handles `t`, `n`, and `k` as inputs and returns a result based on the constraints provided for `n` and `k`.
