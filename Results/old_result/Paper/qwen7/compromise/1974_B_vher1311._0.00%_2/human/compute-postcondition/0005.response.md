The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is at most 2 * 10^5. The function returns an empty string because the conditions specified (where `i` is 0 and `j` is -1) do not allow for any characters to be joined, and no other list or string containing characters is mentioned.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and returns an empty string due to specific conditions where no characters can be joined.**
