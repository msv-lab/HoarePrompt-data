Reasoning:
1. The provided program is intended to decode a string `b` back to the original string `s` by reversing the encoding process.
2. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters of `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
3. To decode, we need to reverse this process:
   - First, create the auxiliary string `r` from `b` by identifying the unique characters and sorting them alphabetically.
   - Then, replace each character in `b` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.
4. However, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding logic:
   - It incorrectly updates the string `s` by replacing characters directly, which can lead to incorrect results due to the mutable nature of strings in Python.
   - It attempts to insert characters into `unique_chars`, but this is unnecessary and incorrect for the decoding process.
5. The function should map each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r` without modifying `s`.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the decoding logic.

Correctness: **False**
