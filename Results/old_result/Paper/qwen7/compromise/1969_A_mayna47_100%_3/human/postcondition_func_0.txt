The function processes a predefined set of inputs (t, n, p) where t is an integer between 1 and 5000, n is an integer between 2 and 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers each between 1 and n, excluding the index position. It initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` with the first element as 0 and the rest as integers from the input list `p`. If it finds an index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`, it prints `2` and returns immediately. Otherwise, it prints `3`.
