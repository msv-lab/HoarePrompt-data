Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, and `v` is updated to include the first element as 0 and the next n elements as integers from the input split and converted to integers.**

This means that the list `v` has been updated to start with 0 followed by n integers provided as input, which are converted to integers. The values of `t` and `p` remain unchanged.
