Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```

In this case, no friend is the best friend of another friend. According to the problem description, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 2 friends so that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the current implementation always prints `2` or `3`, which is incorrect because sending invitations to just 2 friends cannot guarantee that at least 2 friends will come. The correct output for this case should be `4`, as Monocarp needs to invite all friends individually to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and handle the general case where no such pairs exist.
