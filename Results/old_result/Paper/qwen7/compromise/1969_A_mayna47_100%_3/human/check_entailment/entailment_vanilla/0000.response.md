Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop. This is a significant issue because the function should be called for each test case.

3. **Function Implementation:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It updates `v` with the values from the input list of best friends.
   - It then iterates through the list to check if there are any pairs where `v[v[i]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that sending invitations to just these two friends is sufficient.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that at least three friends need to be invited.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1()` is not being called for each test case. This means the logic inside `func_1()` is never executed for the actual test cases.
- Even if `func_1()` were called correctly, the logic might not handle all edge cases properly, but the primary issue here is the missing call to `func_1()`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix this, we need to call `func_1()` within the loop that processes each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the missing call to `func_1()` for each test case. Therefore, the corrected version is needed.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
