Reasoning:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using the function `func_1()`.
- In `func_1()`, it reads the number of friends `n` and initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` with the first element set to 0. The rest of the elements are populated with the input values.
- The program then checks for each friend `i` if `v[v[i]] == i`. If this condition is true for any `i`, it means that there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and thus both will come to the party if invited. In this case, the program prints `2` and returns, which correctly indicates that only 2 invitations are needed.
- If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`. This is because in the worst case, inviting three friends (one and its best friend, and another and its best friend) will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the check `if v[v[i]] == i` does not correctly identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. Instead, it should be checking if `v[i]` is the same as the index of the friend who is `i`'s best friend. The current logic only checks if the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i`, which is not the correct condition.

Given the flawed logic, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations required.

Correctness: **False**
