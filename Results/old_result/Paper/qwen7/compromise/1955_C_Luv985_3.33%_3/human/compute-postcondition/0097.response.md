Output State: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is 0, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
