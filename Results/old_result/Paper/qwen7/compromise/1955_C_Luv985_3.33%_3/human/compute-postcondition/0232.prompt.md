Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[1]` is 0, `a[n-2]` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-2`, `ans` is 2, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Otherwise, `k` is unchanged, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `mi * 2 > k`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is adjusted based on the condition; `l` is 1; `r` is either `n-3` or `n-2`; `ans` is either 3, 4, or determined by the value of `a[r]` and the condition; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is `k % 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is either one less than its original value or remains greater than 1, `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise it is reduced by `t = k % 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi` if `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1 if `l` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
