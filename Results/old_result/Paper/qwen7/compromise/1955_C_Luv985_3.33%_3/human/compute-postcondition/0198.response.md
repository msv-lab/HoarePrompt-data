Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n-2`; `ans` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was set to 2, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
