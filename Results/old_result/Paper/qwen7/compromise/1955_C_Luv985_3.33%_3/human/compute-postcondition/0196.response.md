Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` must be greater than 0; `l` is 0; `r` is `n-2`; `ans` is 2; `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The variable `a[r]` is decremented by the value of `mi`. The value of `r` is `n-2`, so `a[n-2]` is decreased by `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
