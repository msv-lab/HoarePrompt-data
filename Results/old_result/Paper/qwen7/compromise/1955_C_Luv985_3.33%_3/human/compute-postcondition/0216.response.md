Output State: **`l` is 1; `r` is greater than 1; `k` is `k - mi * 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[r]`; `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
