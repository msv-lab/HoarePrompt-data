Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is 1, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, and `a[l]` is either 0 or unchanged.**
