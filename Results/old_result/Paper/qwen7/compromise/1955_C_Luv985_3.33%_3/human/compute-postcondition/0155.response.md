Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by the total number of iterations, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` and `r` point to the same index where one of the elements in the list `a` has been reduced to 0, `ans` is the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` was reduced to 0, and `t` is `k % 2` since the if condition `(l == r)` is true.**
