Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` must be greater than 0; `l` is 1; `r` is `n-2`; `ans` is 3; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
