Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `k` is a string.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` into an integer. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer greater than 1. The variable `k` remains a string as it was not affected by the code.
