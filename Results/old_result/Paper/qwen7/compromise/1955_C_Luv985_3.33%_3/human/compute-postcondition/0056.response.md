Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `r`, `r` must be greater than `l`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `k % 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to the variables, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
