Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `k` also remains unchanged.
