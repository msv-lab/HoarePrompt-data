Output State: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`, `l` must be less than `r - 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 3, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[l]` by `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
