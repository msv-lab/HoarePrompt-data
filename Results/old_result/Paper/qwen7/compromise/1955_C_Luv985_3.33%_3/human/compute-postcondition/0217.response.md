Output State: **`l` is 2; `r` is greater than 1; `k` is `k - mi * 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[r]`; `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was 1, so now `l` is 2. The values of `r`, `k`, `mi`, `a[r]`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
