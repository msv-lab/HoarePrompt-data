Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 3, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.**

This postcondition summarizes that if `mi * 2 <= k`, then `T` decreases by `1 + 2 * mi`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` decreases by `2 * mi`, `l` increases by 1, `r` decreases by 1, `a[r]` is further decreased by `mi`, `ans` becomes 3, and `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If the else part is executed (i.e., `mi * 2 > k`), then `T` decreases by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` becomes 2, and `t` is `k % 2`.
