Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k` and reduced by `2 * mi`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`; `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`; the current value of `a[l]` is 0; `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**
