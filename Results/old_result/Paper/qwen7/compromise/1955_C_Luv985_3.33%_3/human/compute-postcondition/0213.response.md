Output State: **`l` is 1; `r` must be greater than 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[r]`; `a[1]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`, which is `a[1]` in this case. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `mi` remain unchanged.
