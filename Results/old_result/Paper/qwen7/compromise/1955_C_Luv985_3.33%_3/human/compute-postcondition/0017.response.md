Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= mi * 2` decreases the value of `k` by `mi * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and it is given that `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.
