Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. The integers n, x, and y satisfy 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all elements a_i in the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
