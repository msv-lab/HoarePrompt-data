Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the `test_cases` variable, so it remains as described in the initial state. The `results` list is now populated with a single element, which is an empty list.
