Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` remains unchanged, `count` is 0, `test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, and the first tuple in `test_cases` will be used for the next iteration.**

Explanation: The line `mod_x_map = {}` creates an empty dictionary and assigns it to the variable `mod_x_map`. This operation does not affect the values of `results`, `mod_y_map`, `count`, or `test_cases`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states except for `mod_x_map`, which is now an empty dictionary.
