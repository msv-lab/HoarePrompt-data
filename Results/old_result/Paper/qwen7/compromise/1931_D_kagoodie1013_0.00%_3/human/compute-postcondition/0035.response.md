Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, and the first tuple in `test_cases` will be used for the next iteration.**

Explanation: The line `mod_y_map = {}` initializes `mod_y_map` as an empty dictionary. This operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `results`, `mod_x_map`, `count`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial states.
