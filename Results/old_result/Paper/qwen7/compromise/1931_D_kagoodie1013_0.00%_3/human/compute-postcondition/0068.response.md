Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` which is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`. The value of `mod_x` depends on the specific values of `num` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
