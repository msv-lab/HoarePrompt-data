Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `(n, x, y, arr)` from the tuple in `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are tuples left in `test_cases`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is the sum of the counts of all possible remainders when each number in `arr` is divided by `x` and `y`, plus the initial increment for the first iteration.
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged.
   - `count` remains the same as its final calculated value.
   - `test_cases` remains a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple having exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the tuples in `test_cases`, we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple remaining.
   - The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be the first tuple in `test_cases` for the next iteration.

5. **State adjustment**:
   - `results` will remain unchanged as it is not used in the loop head.
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will remain unchanged as they are not used in the loop head.
   - `count` will remain unchanged as it is not used in the loop head.
   - `test_cases` must have at least one tuple remaining, and the first tuple will be used in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is the sum of the counts of all possible remainders when each number in `arr` is divided by `x` and `y`, plus the initial increment for the first iteration, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged, `count` remains the same as its final calculated value, `test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, and the first tuple in `test_cases` will be used for the next iteration.**
