Output State: `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1` for each `num` in `arr`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is `num % x` and the value is the count of how many times that key has appeared, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is `num % y` and the value is the count of how many times that key has appeared, `count` is the total sum of the occurrences of `mod_x` and `mod_y` values across all elements in `arr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `count` will hold the total number of times each modulus result (`mod_x` and `mod_y`) appears in the input array `arr`. `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each unique modulus result for `x` and `y` respectively.
