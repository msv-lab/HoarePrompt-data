Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `test_cases` remains as a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple having exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The variable `count` holds the total sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1` for every element in `arr`. `mod_x_map` contains entries for each unique `mod_x_key` (which is `num % x` for each `num` in `arr`) with the value being the count of how many times each `mod_x_key` appears in `arr`. Similarly, `mod_y_map` contains entries for each unique `mod_y_key` (which is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`) with the value being the count of how many times each `mod_y_key` appears in `arr`.

In simpler terms, `count` will be the sum of the counts of all possible remainders when each number in `arr` is divided by `x` and `y`, plus the initial increment for the first iteration. Both `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each remainder when the numbers in `arr` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
