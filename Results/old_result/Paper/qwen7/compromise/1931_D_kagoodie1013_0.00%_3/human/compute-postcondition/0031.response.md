Output State: **After executing `results.append(count)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is the sum of the counts of all possible remainders when each number in `arr` is divided by `x` and `y`, plus the initial increment for the first iteration. `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged, and `count` remains the same as its final calculated value. `test_cases` remains a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple having exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.**

This means that the `results` list now includes the final value of `count`, which was calculated during the loop iterations. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries retain their previous states, and the `count` variable retains its final value. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged from its initial state, except that it now includes the updated `results` list.
