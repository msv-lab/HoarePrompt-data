Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary with one additional entry where `mod_y_key` maps to `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, and `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the `mod_y_map` dictionary now contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `mod_y_key` (which is `num % y`) and the value is `1` because it was initialized to `0` and then incremented by `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
