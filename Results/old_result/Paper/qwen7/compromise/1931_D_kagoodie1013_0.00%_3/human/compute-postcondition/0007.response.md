Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element, `count` is 0, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_y` which is `num % y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `test_cases` remains a non-empty list with tuples containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, `count` remains 0, `mod_y_map` remains an empty dictionary, and `mod_y` is now `num % y`.
