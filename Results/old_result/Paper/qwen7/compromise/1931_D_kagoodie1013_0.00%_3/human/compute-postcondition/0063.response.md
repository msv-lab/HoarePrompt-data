Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`. This means that the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will change for each iteration.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - `n`: This will be the first element of the current tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `x`: This will be the second element of the current tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `y`: This will be the third element of the current tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `arr`: This will be the fourth element of the current tuple in `test_cases`.

Given that these are the only variables that change within the loop, we need to update their states for the next iteration.

Since the problem does not provide the specific values from the previous iteration, we can generalize the answer based on the structure of the loop.

**Answer**:
State: **`n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases`**
