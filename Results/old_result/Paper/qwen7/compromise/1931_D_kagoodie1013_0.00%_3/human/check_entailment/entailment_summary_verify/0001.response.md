### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes this input to extract test cases, each consisting of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The `func_1` function processes each test case.
   - It initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders (`mod_x` and `mod_y`) and updates the count of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic for calculating `mod_x` and `mod_y` is as follows:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. This is because `-num % x` gives the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`, which effectively shifts the remainder to the range `[0, x-1]`.
     - `mod_y = num % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - The final result for each test case is calculated correctly and stored in the `results` list.

3. **Validation Using Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly states that the function processes each test case and calculates the sum of counts for each element based on specific modulo operations with `x` and `y`.

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness:**
   - The program handles large inputs efficiently due to the use of dictionaries for counting remainders.
   - The logic for calculating `mod_x` and `mod_y` is correct and ensures that the conditions for a pair being "beautiful" are met.
   - The program correctly processes all test cases and outputs the expected results.

Given the detailed analysis and the validation using the function summary, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem statement.
