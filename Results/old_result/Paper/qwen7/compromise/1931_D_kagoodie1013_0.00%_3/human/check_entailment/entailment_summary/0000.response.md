Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes them one by one.
2. Each test case consists of an array `arr` and two integers `x` and `y`.
3. The function `func_1` correctly initializes the necessary variables and maps for counting the beautiful pairs.
4. For each element in the array, it calculates the required modulo values (`mod_x` and `mod_y`) and updates the count of such pairs using the precomputed maps.
5. The logic for calculating `mod_x` and `mod_y` is correct, ensuring that the conditions for a beautiful pair are met.
6. The final result for each test case is correctly appended to the `results` list and returned.

Given the detailed explanation and the structure of the code, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
