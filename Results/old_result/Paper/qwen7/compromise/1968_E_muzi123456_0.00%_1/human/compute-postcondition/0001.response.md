The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero (i.e., truthy), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. Since `t` is non-zero and within the specified range, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive**
