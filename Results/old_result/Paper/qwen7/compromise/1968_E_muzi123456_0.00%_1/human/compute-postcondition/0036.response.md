State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because the `range(1, n + 1)` function requires `n + 1` to be greater than 1 (i.e., `n` must be at least 1).
- The variable `i` starts from 1 in the loop, so it needs to be set to 1 before the loop starts.
- The state of `t` being decreased by 1 is not directly related to the loop's execution condition and can remain unchanged.
