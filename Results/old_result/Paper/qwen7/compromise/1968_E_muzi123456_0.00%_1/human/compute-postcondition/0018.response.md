Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is non-zero (i.e., `t > 0`).

2. **Current State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 3.

3. **Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - Since `i` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to have completed the required number of iterations.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero (`t > 0`).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
