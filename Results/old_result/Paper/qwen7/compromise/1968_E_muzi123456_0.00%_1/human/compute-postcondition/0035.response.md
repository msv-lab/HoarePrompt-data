Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The value of `t` is decreased by 1, and `n` is assigned the value of the integer input from the user. The initial state of `t` being decreased by 1 remains unchanged except that it is now explicitly stated. The value of `n` is unknown until the user inputs an integer, but it is clearly defined as an integer input.
