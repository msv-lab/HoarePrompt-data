Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any number other than 1, it would not satisfy the condition `t = t - 1`.

2. **Variables:**
   - `n` is an input integer (but its value is not specified, so we won't use it in the output).
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(i)`.

Given these points, the print statement will simply output the value of `i`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
