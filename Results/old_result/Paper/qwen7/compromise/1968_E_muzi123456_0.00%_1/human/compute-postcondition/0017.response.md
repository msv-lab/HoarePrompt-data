Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop continues as long as `t` is non-zero (i.e., `t != 0`).

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 3.

3. **Loop Body Analysis**: The loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`. Since `i` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it implies that the loop has already incremented `i` up to 3 times. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3, and `i` must be equal to `n`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, for the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjusting States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t`. It must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
