You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        
        print(' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` remains as the original input integer, `i` is equal to `n`.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by `n` after each full iteration of the loop, and `n` is the number of iterations. The variable `n` remains as the original input integer because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive, and the last value `i` takes is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two values, t and n, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^3. The function returns a value based on these implied inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
