Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any other positive number, it would not be equal to `t - 1`. Therefore, `t` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `i` is initialized to 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

This will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
