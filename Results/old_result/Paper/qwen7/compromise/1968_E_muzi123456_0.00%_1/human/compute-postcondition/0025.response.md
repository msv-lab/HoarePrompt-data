Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any other positive number, it would not satisfy both conditions simultaneously. For example, if `t = 2`, then `t - 1 = 1`, but `2` is not equal to `1`. Therefore, the only value that satisfies both conditions is `t = 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('1', end=' ')`. This will print the string `'1'` followed by a space, due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Given this analysis, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
