Based on the initial state described, the loop will print a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, all on the same line separated by spaces. After the loop, the variable `t` is decreased by `n`, `n` remains as the original input integer, and `i` will be equal to `n`.

However, the `print(' ')` statement simply prints a single space character.
