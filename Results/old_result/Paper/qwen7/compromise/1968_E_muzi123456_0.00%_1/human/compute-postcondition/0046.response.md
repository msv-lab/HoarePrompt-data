Output State: The loop will execute `n` times. After all iterations, `t` will be decreased by `n`, `n` will be less than or equal to 0, and `i` will be `n`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `t` will be reduced by the original value of `n`. Additionally, since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`, by the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`. The condition for the loop to run is that `n` must be a positive integer, so after the loop, `n` will be 0 or negative.
