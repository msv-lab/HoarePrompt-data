Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is initially greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This condition implies that `t` must be 1 because the only number that is equal to itself minus 1 is 1. The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `n`. The original conditions for `t` remain unchanged, so `t` is still greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, which means `t` is 1. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user.
