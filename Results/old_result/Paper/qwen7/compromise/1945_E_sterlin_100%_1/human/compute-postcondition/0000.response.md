Output State: **The program returns a list of strings containing two integers separated by a space.**

Explanation: The code `return input().split()` reads input from the user, splits it into separate strings based on whitespace, and returns them as a list. Given the initial state, the input will consist of two integers separated by a space, which gets split into a list of two string elements.
