You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = 0
        
        if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration of the loop, the variable `k` accumulates based on the conditions provided. Specifically, `k` is incremented by `a + (b + c) // 3`, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, an additional 1 is added to `k`. If any of the conditions `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` are met during an iteration, -1 is printed instead of the value of `k`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, the final value of `k` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case consists of three non-negative integers (a, b, c) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, if the number of introverts (a) is within the range [1, 10^4] and the values of a, b, and c are all within the range [0, 10^9], the function returns information about the distribution of introverts, extroverts, and universals. If any of the constraints are not met, the function indicates an invalid input.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
