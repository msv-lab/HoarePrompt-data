Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has the value of the first element in the list `a`, `cnt` is the total count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between itself and `cnt` whenever an element in `a` that is not equal to `tmp` is encountered.

In simpler terms, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop will have iterated through all elements in the list `a`. The variable `tmp` will retain the value of the first element in the list `a`. The variable `cnt` will hold the count of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`. The variable `ans` will be the minimum value between itself and `cnt` every time an element in `a` that is not equal to `tmp` is encountered during the loop iterations.
