Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
