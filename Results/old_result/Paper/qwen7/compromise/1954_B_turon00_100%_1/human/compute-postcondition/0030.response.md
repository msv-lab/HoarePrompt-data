Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will either remain unchanged (if `ans` was already less than or equal to 0) or be updated to 0 (if `ans` was greater than 0). The value of `i` remains unchanged from its final value after the loop, which is `n`. The value of `cnt` remains 0.
