Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Since `ans` and `cnt` are not initialized before this line, we assume they retain their previous values. The conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
