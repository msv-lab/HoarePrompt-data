Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (`ans`) and the value of `cnt`. Given that `cnt` is initially 0, `ans` is initially set to `n`, and `n` is greater than 0, `ans` remains `n` because `min(n, 0)` is `0`, but since `ans` was initially set to `n`, it does not change. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
