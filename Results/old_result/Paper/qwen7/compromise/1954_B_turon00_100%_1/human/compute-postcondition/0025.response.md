Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, `i` is still `i_prev + 2`, and `ans` is still updated to the minimum between its current value and `cnt`, which now is 0.
