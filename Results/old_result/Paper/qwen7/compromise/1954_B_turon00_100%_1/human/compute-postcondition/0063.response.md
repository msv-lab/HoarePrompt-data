Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`**

Explanation: The code `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt` being explicitly set to 0, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
