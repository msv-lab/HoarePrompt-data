Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is 0.
- `n` is 1.
- `t` is `initial_t - n`, where `n` is 1, so `t` is `initial_t - 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`.
- `i` is `n-1`, so `i` is `1-1` which is 0.

The print statement is:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
