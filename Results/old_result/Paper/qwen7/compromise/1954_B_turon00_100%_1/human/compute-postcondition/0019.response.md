Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or `ans`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is `i_prev + 1` remains unchanged. Additionally, `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`, which is now 0. Therefore, `cnt` is set to 0.
