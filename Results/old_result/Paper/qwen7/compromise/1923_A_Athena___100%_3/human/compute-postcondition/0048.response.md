Output State: **`a` contains all elements except the last one, and the last element of `a` is no longer zero**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given the initial state where `a` must contain at least one element and the last element of `a` must be zero, after executing `a.pop()`, the last element of `a` is no longer zero, and `a` now contains all its previous elements except the last one.
