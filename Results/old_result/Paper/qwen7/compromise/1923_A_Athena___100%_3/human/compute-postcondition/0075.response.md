Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since `a[0]` was required to be `0`, after removing the first element, `a` becomes a non-empty list without its first element, which was `0`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
