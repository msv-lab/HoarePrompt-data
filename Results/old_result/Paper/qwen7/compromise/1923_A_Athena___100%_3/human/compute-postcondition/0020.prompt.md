Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `a` is empty, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` remains an input integer, and `res` remains 0.

This output state occurs because the loop continues to remove elements from the start of the list `a` as long as the first element is 0. After the loop has executed enough times to remove all leading zeros from the list, `a` will be empty. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution since they are not affected by the loop's conditions or body.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `a` is now one element shorter and its last element was 0; `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` remains an input integer; `res` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is not empty and its last element is no longer 0, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` remains an input integer, `res` remains 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is not empty and its last element is no longer 0, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` remains an input integer, `res` remains 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
