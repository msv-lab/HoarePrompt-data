Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (up to 3 times based on the given information), the list `a` has been emptied because it kept removing elements from the end until it was empty. The variable `t` has decreased by `2 * n` after `n` iterations of the loop. The variable `res` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and is not modified within the loop.
