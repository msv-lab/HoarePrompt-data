Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with its first element being 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. According to the initial state, the first element of the list `a` is the second element of the original list, which is 0. After popping the first element (which is 0), the first element of the list `a` becomes the next element in the list, which remains 0 since the list was initially defined such that the first element after popping is still 0. Therefore, the list `a` is still a non-empty list with its first element being 0.
