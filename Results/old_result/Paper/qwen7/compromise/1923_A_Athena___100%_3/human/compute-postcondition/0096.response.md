Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `res` is `res + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` was 1 if `a[i + 1]` is 0, otherwise it remained 0. After executing the code, `res` is now `res + 1`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
