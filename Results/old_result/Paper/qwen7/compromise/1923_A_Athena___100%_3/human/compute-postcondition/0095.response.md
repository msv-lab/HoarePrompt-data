Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is `t - 2 * n`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element.
   - `res` is 1 if `a[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than its value in the current iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The length of the list `a` does not change within the loop, so `len(a)` remains the same.
   - The value of `t` will be further reduced by `2 * n` (assuming `n` remains the same).
   - The value of `res` will remain the same unless `a[i]` becomes 0, but since we don't know the exact value of `a[i]` or `n`, we cannot change `res` without additional information.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `len(a)` remains the same.
- `t` is further reduced by `2 * n`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`. Then, the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `res` is 1 if `a[i_prev + 1]` is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `res` is 1 if `a[i + 1]` is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
