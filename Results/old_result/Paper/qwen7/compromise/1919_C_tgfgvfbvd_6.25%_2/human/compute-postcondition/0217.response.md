Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `x` is an index in list `l`, if the difference between the value at index `x` in list `l` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between the value at index `x` in list `l` and `b`, then the value at index `x` in list `l` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, the value at index `x` in list `l` is equal to `b`.**
