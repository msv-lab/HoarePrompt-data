Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: y is n, b is the maximum value in the list l from index 1 to n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than the last index of list `l`, `x` is equal to `n`, `c` is an integer representing the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is the minimum of the maximum elements found in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b` (or `a` itself if no such element exists), and `b` is the maximum of the minimum elements found in `l` that are less than both `a` and `b` (or `b` itself if no such element exists).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, variable `c` will hold the total number of times an element in the list `l` was either greater than both `a` and `b`, or when it was neither greater than `a` nor `b`, but closer to `a` than to `b`. The variables `a` and `b` will represent the smallest and second smallest unique elements found in the list `l` during the iterations, respectively. If no such unique elements exist, `a` and `b` will retain their initial values. Variable `x` will be equal to `y + c`, where `y` is the initial value of `n` minus the initial value of `x`. The variable `n` will remain unchanged from its initial value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
