Output State: **`c` is `c + 1`, `x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, so `c` is now `c + 1`. The variable `x` is also incremented by 1, so `x` is now `x + 1`. The condition for `n` remains unchanged, meaning `n` must still be greater than `x + 1`.
