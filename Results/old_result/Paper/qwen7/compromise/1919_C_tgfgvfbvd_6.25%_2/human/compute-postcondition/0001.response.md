Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user.
