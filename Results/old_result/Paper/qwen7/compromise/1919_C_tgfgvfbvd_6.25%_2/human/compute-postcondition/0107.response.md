Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for y in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `y` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `y` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `y` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - The value of `l[1]` is greater than the value of `l[0]`
   - `b` is equal to `l[1]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `y` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `y < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `y` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The values of `l[1]` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `y` is now 2
   - `n` is still greater than or equal to 1
   - The value of `l[1]` is still greater than the value of `l[0]`
   - `b` is still equal to `l[1]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the value of `l[1]` is greater than the value of `l[0]`, and `b` is equal to `l[1]`**.
