Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: c is 0, x is equal to n, a is now l[0], b is equal to l[y] if l[y] > l[y - 1] is true for any y in the range(1, n), otherwise b remains 0, l is a list of integers created from the input, and y is n.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l[x]` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `b` is an integer. If the value at index `x` in list `l` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then the value at index `x` in list `l` is adjusted to be the maximum of `a` and `b`. If the value at index `x` in list `l` is less than both `a` and `b`, and the difference between `a` and the value at index `x` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and the value at index `x`, then the value at index `x` in list `l` is set to `a`. Otherwise, the value at index `x` in list `l` is set to `b`. If the value at index `x` in list `l` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to the value at index `x`. Otherwise, `l[x]` remains equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `x` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, and if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is the new value at index `x` in list `l`. Otherwise, `b` is the new value at index `x` in list `l`. If the condition `l[x] < a and l[x] < b` is not met, then the value at index `x` in list `l` is updated to either `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, or `b` if `a` is less than `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is the element at index `x` in list `l` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, or `b` is the value at index `x` of list `l` if `l[x] - a` is less than `l[x] - b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is the element at index `x` in list `l`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged and `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
