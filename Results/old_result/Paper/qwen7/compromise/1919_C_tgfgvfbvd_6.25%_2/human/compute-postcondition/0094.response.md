Based on the initial state provided:

- `y` is equal to `n`.
- `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n`.

However, the print statement refers to a variable `c`, which is not mentioned in the initial state. Since `c` is not defined or initialized in the given information, we cannot determine its value.

Therefore, the print statement will result in an error because `c` is undefined.

Output: **NameError: name 'c' is not defined**
