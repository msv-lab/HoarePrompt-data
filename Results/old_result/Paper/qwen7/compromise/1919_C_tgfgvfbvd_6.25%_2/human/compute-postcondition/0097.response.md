Output State: **`y` is `n`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, `l` is a list of integers created by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The initial values of `y` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `l` is created based on the input provided by the user.
