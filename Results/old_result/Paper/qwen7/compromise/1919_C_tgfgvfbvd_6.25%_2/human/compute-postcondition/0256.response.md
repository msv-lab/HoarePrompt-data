Postcondition: `x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, and if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is the new value at index `x` in list `l`. Otherwise, `b` is the new value at index `x` in list `l`. If the condition `l[x] < a and l[x] < b` is not met, then the value at index `x` in list `l` is updated to either `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, or `b` if `a` is less than `l[x]`.
