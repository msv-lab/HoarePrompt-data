Output State: **Postcondition: `y` is equal to `n-1`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `b` is assigned from the first element in the list `l` if no element in the list from index 1 to `n-1` is greater than the first element.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `y` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `b` will hold the maximum value found in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1` during any iteration where `l[y]` is greater than `l[y-1]`. If no such element is found, `b` will retain the value of the first element in the list `l` (which is `a`).
