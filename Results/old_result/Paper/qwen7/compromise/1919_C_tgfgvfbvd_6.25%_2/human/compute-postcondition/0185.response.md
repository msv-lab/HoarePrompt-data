Output State: **`y` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `x` is equal to `n`, `c` is an integer representing the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is the minimum of the maximum elements found in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b` (or `a` itself if no such element exists), and `b` is the maximum of the minimum elements found in `l` that are less than both `a` and `b` (or `b` itself if no such element exists); `l` is a list of integers created from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `l`. The values of `y`, `n`, `x`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
