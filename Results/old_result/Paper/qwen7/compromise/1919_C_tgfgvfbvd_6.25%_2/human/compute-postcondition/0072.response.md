Postcondition: `y` is `n`, and `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. Specifically, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then:
- If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, `b` remains the maximum value in the list.
- Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.
If the condition `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` is not met, then:
- If `a` (which is `l[x]`) is greater than or equal to `b`, `b` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.
