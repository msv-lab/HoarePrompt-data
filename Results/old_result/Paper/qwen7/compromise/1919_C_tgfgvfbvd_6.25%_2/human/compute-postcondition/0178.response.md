Postcondition: `y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, and `x` is `n + 1`. If the condition `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` is true, and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If the condition `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` is not true, then if `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `x` in list `l`, no change is made to `a` and `b` remains as the element at index `x` in list `l`. Otherwise, `a` remains as the element at index `x` in list `l` and `b` remains as the element at index `x` in list `l`.
