Output State: **`y` is 3, `b` is `l[3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `y` and `b`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no such loop or if statement is mentioned in the code, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or if statement context.
