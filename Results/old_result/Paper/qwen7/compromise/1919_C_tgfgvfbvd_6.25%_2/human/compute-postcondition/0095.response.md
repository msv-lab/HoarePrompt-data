Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the input value that determines the number of iterations and the loop counter itself (though it's represented by `_` which is typically used to indicate an unused variable).

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `y` is `n`
   - `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n`

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be greater than 0. Since the loop counter is incremented each time the loop runs, the input value must be decremented by 1 for each iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The input value is the only variable that changes with each iteration of the loop.
   - The variables `y` and `b` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they stay the same.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated input value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`y` is `n`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n`, and the input value must be greater than 0**. 

However, to be precise about the input value, if we denote the initial input value as `input_value`, then at the start of the next iteration, `input_value` should be reduced by 1.

So, the precise state would be:
State: **`y` is `n`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n`, and the input value must be greater than 0 (reduced by 1 from the previous value)**.
