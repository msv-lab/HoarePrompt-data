Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `n <= k` checks if Bob can repaint all parts, which means Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color after Alice has painted them. This condition ensures that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob still has enough parts to repaint to achieve his goal.

3. **Output**: Based on the conditions, the program prints 'NO' if either condition is met, indicating that Bob can always make all parts the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the conditions and logic implemented in the program are correct.

Correctness: **True**
