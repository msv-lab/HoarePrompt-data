Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
2. The given solution checks two conditions:
   - If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is correct because if Bob can repaint at most `k` parts and there are `n` parts, he can always repaint all parts to have the same color.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it also prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it does not correctly capture the scenario where Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
3. The correct approach should consider that even if Bob can repaint up to `k` parts, if Alice paints the ribbon such that the number of parts of each color is greater than `k`, Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
4. The correct condition should be: if `math.ceil(n / m) > k`, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it uses an incorrect condition to determine when Bob can make all parts have the same color.

Correctness: **False**
