Output State: **The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions given in the loop. Specifically, for each test case, if \( n \leq k \) or \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil < k \), 'NO' will be printed; otherwise, 'YES' will be printed. The number of lines with 'YES' or 'NO' will correspond to the value of \( t \).**
