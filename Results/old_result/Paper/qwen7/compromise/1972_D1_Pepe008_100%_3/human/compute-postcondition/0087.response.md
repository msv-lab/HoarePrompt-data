Output State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least `2`, `suma` is `x + 1`, `i` is `3`, `x` is `1`, the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` is `a - 3**.

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` (which is `1`) to `suma`. Since the initial value of `suma` is `x + 1` (which is `2`), after adding `x`, `suma` becomes `x + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
