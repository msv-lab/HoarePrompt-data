Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` remains 0
   - `info` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string
   - `a` remains the first element of `info`
   - `b` must still be a positive integer
   - `suma` is `x + 2`
   - `i` is now 3
   - `x` is calculated as \(\frac{a - 3 \times (3 - 1)}{3}\) if \(\frac{a - i \times (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1 > 0\), otherwise the same conditions apply without any changes to `suma`, `i`, or `x`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < b + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `b + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `b` must still be a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains 0
   - `info` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string
   - `a` remains the first element of `info`
   - `b` must be a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4
   - `suma` remains `x + 2`
   - `i` is updated to 4
   - `x` remains the same as the previous value since the condition for updating `x` was not met (as `i` was 3).

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info`, `b` must be a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, `suma` is `x + 2`, `i` is 4, `x` is the same as the previous value**.
