Output State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least 4, `suma` is either `x + 2` or remains `0`, `i` is `4`, `x` is `1`, `x` is `a - 4 // 4 ** 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` is `a - 4`, we substitute `a - 4` for `a - i * (i - 1) // i` in the formula. Since `i` is `4`, the calculation becomes `(a - 4) // 4 ** 2 + 1`. Given that `a - 4` is the same as the current value of `x`, which is `1`, we substitute `1` for `a - 4` in the formula, resulting in `1 // 4 ** 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `0 + 1` because `1 // 16` is `0`. Therefore, `x` is updated to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
