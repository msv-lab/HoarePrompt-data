Output State: `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info`, `b` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `suma` is the sum calculated after all iterations of the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is the last value of `x` calculated within the loop, which is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b**2 + 1`, if `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b**2 + 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged and `x` is not incremented.

To break it down further:
- `t` remains 0 because there's no operation that changes `t` within the loop.
- `info` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `a` remains the first element of `info` throughout the loop.
- `b` must be a positive integer and is used as the upper limit for the loop.
- `suma` accumulates values based on the conditions inside the loop. After all iterations, `suma` will be the total sum of all valid `x` values plus additional increments if certain conditions are met.
- `i` will be `b + 1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from 1 to `b` inclusive.
- `x` will be the last value calculated for `x` during the final iteration of the loop, unless the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` fails, in which case `x` does not change.
