Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
            suma += x
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                suma += 1
    print(suma - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info`, `b` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `suma` is the sum calculated after all iterations of the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is the last value of `x` calculated within the loop, which is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b**2 + 1`, if `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b**2 + 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged and `x` is not incremented.

To break it down further:
- `t` remains 0 because there's no operation that changes `t` within the loop.
- `info` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `a` remains the first element of `info` throughout the loop.
- `b` must be a positive integer and is used as the upper limit for the loop.
- `suma` accumulates values based on the conditions inside the loop. After all iterations, `suma` will be the total sum of all valid `x` values plus additional increments if certain conditions are met.
- `i` will be `b + 1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from 1 to `b` inclusive.
- `x` will be the last value calculated for `x` during the final iteration of the loop, unless the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` fails, in which case `x` does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all iterations with `i` ranging from 1 to `b` (inclusive). The final value of `suma` is the sum of all `x` values where `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` is the final value it was set to during the loop's execution, `suma` is the sum calculated based on the loop's conditions, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is `a - (b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`.

After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains `T`, `info` stays as the list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `b` takes its final value which is the upper limit of the range specified in the loop. The variable `suma` accumulates the value of `x` plus one under certain conditions throughout the loop's iterations. Specifically, `suma` is incremented by `x + 1` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` and by an additional `1` if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true. The variable `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `b + 1`, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
