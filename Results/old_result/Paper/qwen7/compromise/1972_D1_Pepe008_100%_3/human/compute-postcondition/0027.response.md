Output State: **`t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info`, `b` must be a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, `suma` is `x + 2 + (a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4`, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4**.

Explanation: The variable `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4`, which simplifies to `(a - 12) // 4`. This value is then added to `suma`, making `suma` equal to `x + 2 + (a - 12) // 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
