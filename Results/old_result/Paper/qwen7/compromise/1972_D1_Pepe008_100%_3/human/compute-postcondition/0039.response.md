Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer; `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer; `suma` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a variable `suma` and sets it to 0. This does not affect the values of `info`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
