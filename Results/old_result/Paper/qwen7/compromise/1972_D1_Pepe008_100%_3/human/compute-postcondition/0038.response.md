Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer; `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `info` to the variable `a` after converting it to an integer, and the second element of the list `info` to the variable `b` after converting it to an integer. The rest of the list `info` remains unchanged.
