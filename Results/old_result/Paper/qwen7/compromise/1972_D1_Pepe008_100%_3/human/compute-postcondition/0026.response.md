Output State: **`t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info`, `b` must be a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, `suma` is `x + 2`, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4 ** 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is updated according to the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `i` is 4, the expression simplifies to `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
