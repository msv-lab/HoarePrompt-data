Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `x` and the conditions for incrementing `suma` do not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case `(n=10, m=8)` from the example output:

- The program calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- It checks if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` to decide whether to increment `suma` by 1.

However, these calculations do not correctly determine whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. For instance, for the pair `(6, 2)`, the program incorrectly increments `suma` because the conditions are met, but this pair does not satisfy the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

A correct implementation would involve checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` directly for each pair `(a, b)`. The current logic in the program does not ensure this condition is met, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
