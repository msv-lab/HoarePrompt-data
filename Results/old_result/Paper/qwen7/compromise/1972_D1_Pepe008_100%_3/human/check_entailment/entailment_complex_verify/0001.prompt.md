You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

                suma += x

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1

                suma += x

    #State: Output State: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` is the final value it was set to during the loop's execution, `suma` is the sum calculated based on the loop's conditions, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is `a - (b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`.
    #
    #After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains `T`, `info` stays as the list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `b` takes its final value which is the upper limit of the range specified in the loop. The variable `suma` accumulates the value of `x` plus one under certain conditions throughout the loop's iterations. Specifically, `suma` is incremented by `x + 1` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` and by an additional `1` if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true. The variable `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `b + 1`, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for each iteration. Finally, `suma` is printed after all iterations, minus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving these integers and prints the result minus 2. The function reads the number of test cases from the input, followed by pairs of integers for each test case. It ensures that the values meet certain constraints and performs calculations to determine the final sum, which is then outputted.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - `T` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, we read two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - It calculates \(x\) using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - If \(x\) is greater than 0, it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), and if so, adds 1 to `suma`.

### Key Issues:
1. **Formula for \(x\):**
   - The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) does not correctly represent the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Consideration:**
   - The program does not consider the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd(a, b)\)) in the calculation, which is crucial for determining the valid pairs.

3. **Incorrect Condition Check:**
   - The condition check \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is not relevant to the problem. These conditions do not help in finding the valid pairs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
