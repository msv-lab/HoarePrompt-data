Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem statement.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and initializes `suma` to 0.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b` (where `b` is the second input `m`).
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Additionally, if certain conditions are met (`(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`), it adds 1 to `suma`.

3. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are not directly related to the problem's requirements. The problem requires checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This logic is missing in the given code.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the code prints `suma - 2`.

Given the analysis, the code does not correctly implement the required logic. It incorrectly attempts to solve the problem with a different approach that does not align with the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
