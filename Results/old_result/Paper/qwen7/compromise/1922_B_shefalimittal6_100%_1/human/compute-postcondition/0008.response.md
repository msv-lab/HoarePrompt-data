Output State: **`idx` is 4, `t` is 1 (or greater), `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from `int(data[2])`, `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `t`, `data`, `n`, `a`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
