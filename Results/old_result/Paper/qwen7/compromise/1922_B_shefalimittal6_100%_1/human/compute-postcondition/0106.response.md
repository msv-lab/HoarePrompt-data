Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved in this loop is `_`, but since it is a dummy variable (usually an underscore), it does not affect the state of other variables.

2. **Identify the relevant variables**: The relevant variables that can be affected by the loop are `results`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `idx`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be incremented by 1, and it should still be within the range of `t`.

4. **Determine the new state**:
   - `results`: This list is not directly modified by the loop itself, so its state remains the same.
   - `cnt`: This variable is not directly modified by the loop itself, so its state remains the same.
   - `ans`: This variable is not directly modified by the loop itself, so its state remains the same.
   - `idx`: This variable needs to be incremented by 1 from `n + 1` to `n + 2` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `idx`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is calculated based on the specified conditions, and `idx` is `n + 2`**.
