Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `v[i] >= 3`, then `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increases the value of `cnt` by the current value of `v[i]`. The value of `i` is also increased by 1. The condition to increase `ans` by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` only depends on the new value of `v[i]`, which is `v[i+1]` after the increment of `i`. Since the original value of `v[i]` was used to update `cnt`, the condition for increasing `ans` remains the same as the postcondition given.
