Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know the following from the initial state:
   - `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.
   - `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`.
   - `ans` is calculated based on specified conditions.
   - `idx` is `n + 3`.
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

4. **List the Adjusted States**: The only variables that need adjustment are `n`. The other variables (`results`, `cnt`, `ans`, `idx`, and `v`) are not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
