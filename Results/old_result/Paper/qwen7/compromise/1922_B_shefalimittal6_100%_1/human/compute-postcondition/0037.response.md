Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is `v[idx]`
   - `idx` is equal to `4 + n`
   - `ans` is either `v[4 + n] * (v[4 + n] - 1) * (v[4 + n] - 2) // 6` if `v[4 + n]` is greater than or equal to 3, or remains unchanged if `v[4 + n]` is less than 3
   - `n` must be non-negative

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Hence, `i` will become `5`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`cnt` is `v[idx]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is either `v[4 + n] * (v[4 + n] - 1) * (v[4 + n] - 2) // 6` if the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, or remains unchanged if the current value of `v[i]` is less than 3, `n` must be non-negative, `i` is 5**
