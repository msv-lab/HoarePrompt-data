Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**.

The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `x`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `x` is now an integer derived from `data[idx]`.
