Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `x` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. Since `x` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, the list `v` at index `x` is incremented. The precondition that `idx` is increased by 1 remains unchanged, and `n` remains a positive integer.
