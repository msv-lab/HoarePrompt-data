Postcondition: `cnt` is `v[9]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is updated based on the value of `v[6]`. If `v[6]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[6] * (v[6] - 1) // 2` to its current value. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the if part.
