Output State: **`idx` is 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n.**

The code `idx = 0` simply initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `idx` updated to 0.
