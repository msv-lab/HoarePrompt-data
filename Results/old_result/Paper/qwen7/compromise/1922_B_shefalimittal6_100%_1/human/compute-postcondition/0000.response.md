Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5; input function is replaced by `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This means that instead of using the standard `input()` function to read input from the user, the program will now use `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input at once. However, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
