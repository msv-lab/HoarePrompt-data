Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `idx` is increased by 1**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `x` is an integer from `data[idx]`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `idx`, which is now one more than its previous value.
