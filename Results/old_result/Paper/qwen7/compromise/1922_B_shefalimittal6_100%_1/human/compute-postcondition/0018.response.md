Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(n):`. This means the loop depends on the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is incremented by 1 and then incremented by 1 again.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
   - The value of `idx` and `v[x]` does not affect the loop condition directly, but they might be part of the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the states based on the loop head, we do not need to change them here.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so it is the only one we need to adjust.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
