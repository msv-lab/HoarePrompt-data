Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is `v[i]`, `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it. Here, `cnt` is equal to `v[i]`, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `v[i] * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. The values of `i` and `cnt` remain unchanged.
