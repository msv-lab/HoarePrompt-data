Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is `v[4 + n] * (v[4 + n] - 1) * (v[4 + n] - 2) // 6`, `n` must be non-negative, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, where `i` is `4 + n`. Since `v[i]` is specified to be greater than or equal to 3, the updated value of `ans` is calculated using this condition. The other variables (`cnt` and `idx`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
