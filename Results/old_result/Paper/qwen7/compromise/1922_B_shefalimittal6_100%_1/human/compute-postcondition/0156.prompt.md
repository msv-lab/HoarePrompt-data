Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v[x] += 1
    cnt = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if v[i] >= 2:
            ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
        if v[i] >= 3:
            ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        cnt += v[i]
    results.append(str(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is the sum of all elements in the list `v`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is the sum of two parts: 1. The first part is the sum of `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is at least 3. 2. The second part is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is at least 2. `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is calculated based on the specified conditions, and `idx` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in the list `v` from index `0` to `2 * n`, `ans` is the sum of all increments based on the values of `v[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `2 * n`, and `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
