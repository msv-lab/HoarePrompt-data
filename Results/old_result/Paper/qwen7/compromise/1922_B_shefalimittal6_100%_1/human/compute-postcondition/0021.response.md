Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `v` or `x`, we only know that `v[x]` is increased by 1. The conditions and values of `n` and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
