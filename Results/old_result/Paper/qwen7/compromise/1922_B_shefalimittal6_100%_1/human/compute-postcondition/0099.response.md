Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` if `v[i] >= 2`; now `ans` is also increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. This does not affect the values of `cnt` or `i` directly, but it does add to `ans`. The condition for updating `cnt` and `ans` previously was `v[i] >= 2`, which remains valid here. Therefore, the updated state includes the additional increment to `ans` based on the new value of `v[i]`.
