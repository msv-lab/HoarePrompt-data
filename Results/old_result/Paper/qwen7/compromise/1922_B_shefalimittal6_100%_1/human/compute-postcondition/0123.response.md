Output State: The loop has executed `n` times; `idx` is increased by `n`; `v[x]` is incremented `n` times for each `x` which is an integer from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `idx` will be `n + 3` (initial value) plus `n` (number of iterations), so `idx` will be `3 + n`. Each element in the list `v` will be incremented for every occurrence of its index in the sublist of `data` from `idx - n` to `idx - 1`.
