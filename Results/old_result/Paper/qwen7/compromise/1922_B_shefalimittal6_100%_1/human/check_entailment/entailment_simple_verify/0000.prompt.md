You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the string representation of the final value of `ans` after all iterations of the loop have completed, `cnt` is the total count of non-zero elements in the list `v` summed across all iterations, `idx` is equal to `3 * t + 1`, and `ans` is the cumulative sum of all increments based on the values of `v[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `2 * n` across all iterations.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain a single string representing the final computed value of `ans`. The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of non-zero elements encountered in the list `v` across all iterations. The variable `idx` will point to the position right after the last processed element in the `data` list, which would be `3 * t + 1` since `t` is the number of iterations and we start processing from index 2. The variable `ans` will be the aggregated result of applying the given formulas to the lists `v` generated in each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the final value of ans (where ans is the cumulative sum of all increments based on the values of v[i] for each i from 0 to 2 * n across all iterations)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. However, the program does not check this condition.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3
1 1 2
```

The program will output `3` because it counts all combinations of three sticks, but the combination of sticks with lengths `1`, `1`, and `2` cannot form a non-degenerate triangle since `1 + 1 <= 2`.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check to ensure that the selected three sticks satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.
