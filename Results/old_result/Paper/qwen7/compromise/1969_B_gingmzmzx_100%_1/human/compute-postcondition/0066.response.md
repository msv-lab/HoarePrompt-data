Output State: **`c` is the first element of `s`; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The value of `c` remains the first element of `s`, and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. The precondition that `c` is not 0 remains valid.
