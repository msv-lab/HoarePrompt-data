Output State: **`ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1`, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, `c` is the next element in `s` and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it increments `ans` by 0. Since `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, it will now be greater than 0 (assuming it was not already greater than 0). Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
