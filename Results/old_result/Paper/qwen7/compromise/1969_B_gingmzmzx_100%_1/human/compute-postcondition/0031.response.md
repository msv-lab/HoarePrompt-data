Output State: **`zeroes` is now equal to the count of 0s in the original list `s`; `ans` is 0; `t` remains unchanged; `n` is now `n-1`; `cnt` is `[0, 0]`; `c` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets `ans` to 0. All other variables (`zeroes`, `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
