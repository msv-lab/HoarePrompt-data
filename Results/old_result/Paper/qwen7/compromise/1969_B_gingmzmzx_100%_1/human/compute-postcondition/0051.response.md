Output State: **`ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by `(1 if c == 0 else 2)`, `c` is the next element in `s`, and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` increments `ans` by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The values of `cnt[c]`, `c`, and the increment of `cnt[c]` remain unchanged from their previous states.
