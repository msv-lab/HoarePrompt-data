Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5. For each test case, it returns either the integer `t` or a binary string `s` based on the given conditions.**
