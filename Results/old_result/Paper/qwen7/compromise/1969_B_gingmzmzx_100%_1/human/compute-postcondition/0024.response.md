Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list (excluding the first element), `c` is the first element of the updated list `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`, `zeroes` is updated based on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, and `c` is either 0 or not 0.
