State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder) and `n`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. The variable `t` is not used within the loop condition or directly in the loop itself, so its value does not affect whether the loop will execute.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0.
