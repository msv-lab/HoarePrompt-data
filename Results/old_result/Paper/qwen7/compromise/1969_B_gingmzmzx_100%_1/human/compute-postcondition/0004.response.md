Output State: **`zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is [0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code initializes the list `cnt` with two zeros. The values of `zeroes`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new list `cnt` with the values `[0, 0]`.
