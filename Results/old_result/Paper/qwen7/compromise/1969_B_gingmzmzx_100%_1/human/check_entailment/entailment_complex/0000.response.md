Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of valid subarrays under specific conditions. However, the logic used to calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order is incorrect. The code simply counts the number of valid subarrays based on the presence of zeros and ones without considering the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the binary string. Each cyclic shift of a substring contributes to the total cost, and the goal is to minimize this cost.

The given code does not actually perform any cyclic shifts or calculate the cost of such shifts. Instead, it seems to be counting something related to the distribution of zeros and ones in the string, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Given the problem statement, the correct approach would involve identifying the points where the string needs to be split to form a sorted binary string and calculating the cost of cyclic shifts accordingly.

Therefore, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
