### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and the annotated code step-by-step to ensure the original assessment is accurate.

#### Input Handling and Initialization
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` which represent the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
- It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
- Adjusting indices by subtracting 1 from each element is correct to accommodate 0-based indexing in Python.

#### Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` aims to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
- Variables `mx` and `cur` are initialized correctly.
- The `vis` list is used to mark visited positions, ensuring the simulation does not get stuck in an infinite loop.
- The loop iterates up to `k` times, updating the score and position accordingly.
- The function returns the maximum score achievable from the starting position `s`.

#### Main Logic
- The main part of the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
- It compares the scores obtained from `func_1` for both players.
- Based on the comparison, it prints whether Bodya, Sasha, or there is a draw.

### Detailed Evaluation

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game for one player. It ensures that the player maximizes their score by staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The use of `vis` to detect cycles is crucial to prevent infinite loops and ensure the simulation runs for exactly `k` turns.
   - The `mx` variable keeps track of the maximum score encountered during the iterations, which is returned at the end.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly compares the scores obtained from `func_1` for both players.
   - The conditions for printing "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" are correctly implemented.
   - The program handles all edge cases, such as when `k` is zero or when the starting positions lead to immediate cycles.

### Verification of Correctness

- The program correctly handles the input and initializes the necessary variables.
- The function `func_1` accurately simulates the game for one player and returns the maximum possible score.
- The main logic correctly compares the scores and prints the appropriate result.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. All steps are logically sound and handle the problem as described.

### Final Answer
