Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is `k - 1`, `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions and relationships between the variables are preserved, with `mx` being updated if necessary, `cur` being incremented by `a[s]`, `k` being reduced by 1, `vis[s]` remaining 1, and `s` being updated to `p[s]`.
