Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur` by adding `a[s]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `cur` is now `cur + a[s]`. The other conditions and values of `mx`, `k`, `vis[s]`, and `s` remain as they were initially.
