You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array a, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, s is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, and k is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is the maximum value encountered during all iterations of the loop, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` accumulated during all iterations, `k` is 0 (since it is decremented until it reaches 0), `vis[s]` is 1 if `s` was visited during any iteration, otherwise it remains 0, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` after each iteration until the condition `not vis[s] and k > 0` no longer holds.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, `mx` will hold the highest value of `cur + k * a[s]` seen during any iteration, `cur` will be the total sum of `a[s]` added across all iterations, `k` will be 0 as it gets decremented to 0, `vis[s]` will be marked as 1 for any `s` that was visited, and `s` will point to its final value after the last iteration where the loop condition was still met.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during all iterations of the loop, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` accumulated during all iterations, `k` is 0, `vis[s]` is marked as 1 for any `s` that was visited, and `s` points to its final value after the last iteration where the loop condition was still met.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers from 1 to n `p`, a list of integers `s` representing the starting positions, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the duration of the game. It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during all iterations of the loop, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` accumulated during all iterations, `k` is 0, `vis[s]` is marked as 1 for any `s` that was visited, and `s` points to its final value after the last iteration where the loop condition was still met.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during all iterations of the loop, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` accumulated during all iterations, `k` is 0, `vis[s]` is marked as 1 for any `s` that was visited, and `s` points to its final value after the last iteration where the loop condition was still met.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
