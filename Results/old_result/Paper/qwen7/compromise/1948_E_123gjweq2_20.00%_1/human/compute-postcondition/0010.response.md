The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. Both `left` and `right` are integers where `left` is less than `right`, and they represent the range of indices in the array `arr` and `cliquess` to be filled. `clique` is an integer representing the current clique identifier. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` define a range of indices in arrays `arr` and `cliquess`, and `clique` represents a current clique identifier.**
