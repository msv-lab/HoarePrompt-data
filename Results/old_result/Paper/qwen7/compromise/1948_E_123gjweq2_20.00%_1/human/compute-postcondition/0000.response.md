Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer, and `clique` is an integer representing the current clique identifier; `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

This means that the value of `left` and `right` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `clique` also remains unchanged. The new variable `small_element` is set to `left + 1`.
