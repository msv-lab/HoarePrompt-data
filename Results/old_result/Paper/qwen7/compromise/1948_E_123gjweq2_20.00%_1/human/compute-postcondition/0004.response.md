Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute if `mid` is greater than 0. This is because `range(mid)` will generate a sequence of integers from 0 to `mid-1`, and if `mid` is 0 or less, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `left` is an integer.
   - `right` is an integer.
   - `clique` is an integer representing the current clique identifier.
   - `small_element` is `left + 1`.
   - `big_element` is `right + 1`.
   - `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`.
   - `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.

4. **Calculate `mid`**:
   \[
   mid = \frac{(right + 1) - (left + 1)}{2} = \frac{right - left}{2}
   \]
   For `mid` to be greater than 0, `right` must be greater than `left`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `mid` is greater than 0, which means `right` must be greater than `left`.
   - Since `i` will take values from 0 to `mid-1`, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value; it will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `left` and `right` such that `right > left`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer, and `right` must be greater than `left`**.
