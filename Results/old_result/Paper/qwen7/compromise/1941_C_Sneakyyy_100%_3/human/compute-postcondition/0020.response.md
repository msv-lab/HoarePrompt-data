Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `i` is either 2, 4, or 6.
3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

Given that `i` can be 2, 4, or 6, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a) - 2` for the loop to continue.

- If `i` is 2, then `i + 3` would be 5. For the loop to continue, `len(a)` must be greater than 7.
- If `i` is 4, then `i + 3` would be 7. For the loop to continue, `len(a)` must be greater than 9.
- If `i` is 6, then `i + 3` would be 9. For the loop to continue, `len(a)` must be greater than 11.

Since `a` is a string with its length greater than 5, the minimum possible length of `a` is 6. However, to ensure the loop continues, we need to consider the maximum possible values of `i` given in the problem.

Therefore, the length of `a` must be greater than the maximum possible value of `i + 3`, which is 9 (when `i` is 6).

So, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `len(a)` must be greater than 9.

**State:**
State: **`i` is either 2, 4, or 6; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with its length greater than 9; `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1; `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**
