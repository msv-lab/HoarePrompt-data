Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i+1` and of length 3**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, which changes the starting index of the substring `s`. Initially, `s` started from index `i`, but now it starts from `i+1`. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and the length of the substring `s` remains 3.
