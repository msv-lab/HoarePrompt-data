Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the string `a` minus 2, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is 0, `s` remains the substring of `a` starting from the last possible index (length of `a` minus 2) and having a length of 3, unless the last possible index does not form a complete substring of length 3, in which case `s` will be shorter or non-existent, and the number of iterations left is `N - k`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
