Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 6; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with its length greater than 5; `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0; `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 3. Given that `i` was initially either 1 or 3, adding 3 to these values results in `i` being either 4 or 6. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
