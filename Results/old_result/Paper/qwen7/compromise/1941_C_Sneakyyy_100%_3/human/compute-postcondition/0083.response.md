Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `i` is either 2, 4, or 6.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 6.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 (unless the index 2 is out of bounds) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1.
   - `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and still satisfy the condition `i < len(a) - 2`.
   - Since `i` can be 2, 4, or 6, the next possible value for `i` would be 4 or 6 (if `i` is 2), or 6 or 8 (if `i` is 4), or 8 or 10 (if `i` is 6).
   - However, since `len(a)` must be greater than 6, the maximum value of `i` that can be incremented without violating the loop condition is `len(a) - 3`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to a value that allows the loop to continue. The current values of `i` are 2, 4, or 6. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the next valid value.
   - Since `len(a)` must be greater than 6, the next valid value for `i` would be the smallest value that satisfies the condition `i < len(a) - 2` and is greater than the current value of `i`.

Given the constraints, if `i` is currently 2, the next valid value would be 4. If `i` is currently 4, the next valid value would be 6. If `i` is currently 6, the next valid value would be 8.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:

- `i` must be set to the next valid value that allows the loop to continue.
- `len(a)` must remain greater than 6.

Since `i` can be 2, 4, or 6, we need to ensure that the next value of `i` is valid and within the range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be set to 4 if it is currently 2, 6 if it is currently 4, or 8 if it is currently 6, and `len(a)` must be greater than 6.**
