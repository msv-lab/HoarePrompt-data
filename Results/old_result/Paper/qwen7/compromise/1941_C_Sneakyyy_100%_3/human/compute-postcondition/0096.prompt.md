You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the final state will be:
    #
    #- `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 2`, as the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches this value.
    #- `ans` will contain the total count of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie'.
    #- `t` will remain a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), as it is not affected by the loop.
    #- `n` will remain an input integer, unchanged by the loop.
    #- `a` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #- `s` will be the substring of `a` starting from the index `len(a) - 2` and having a length of 3 (unless the index `len(a)` is out of bounds, in which case `s` will be shorter or non-existent).
    #
    #In summary, the loop processes all possible substrings of length 3 in the string `a`, counting how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear, and sets `i` to the position just before the last possible substring of length 3. The other variables retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
