Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string and its length must be greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 0 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the string `a` starting at index `i` (which is 0) and having a length of 3 characters. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
