Output State: **`i` is either 3, 5, or 7; `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `a` remains unchanged; `ans` is 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1; `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the index `i` and having a length of 3 (unless the index `i + 2` is out of bounds, in which case `s` will be shorter or non-existent); `len(a)` must be greater than 8; `i` is increased by 1.**

This output state reflects that `i` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
