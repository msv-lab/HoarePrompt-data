Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), each being either 0 or 1. The function returns a result for each test case, indicating whether at least one cell contains a chip.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a sequence of n binary values (0s and 1s). It checks if any of these binary values are 1, indicating the presence of a chip, and returns a result accordingly for each test case.
