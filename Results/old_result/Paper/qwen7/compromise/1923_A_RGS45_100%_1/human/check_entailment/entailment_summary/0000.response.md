Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to the left to form a single block without any free cells between them, minimizing the number of operations.
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - It finds the first and last positions of '1' in the sequence.
   - It extracts the substring between these positions.
   - It counts the number of '0's in this substring.
3. This approach does not account for the fact that chips need to be moved to the closest free cell to the left, which may not necessarily be within the extracted substring.
4. For example, in the test case `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`, the code would extract `111011` and count the '0's, which is incorrect because the chip in the 7th position needs to be moved to the 5th position, not just counted as part of the substring.
5. The code fails to simulate the actual movement of chips and only counts '0's in a substring, which does not reflect the minimum number of operations needed.

Correctness: **False**
