Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `input()`, which is set to `sys.stdin.read`, splits the input into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `s` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
