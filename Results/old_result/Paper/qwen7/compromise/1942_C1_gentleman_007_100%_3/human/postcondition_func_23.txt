The function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of a polygon represented by a graph. It starts from a given vertex, visits all adjacent vertices, and continues exploring their neighbors until all vertices have been visited. After the traversal, the `stack` contains all vertices in the order they were discovered, and the `vis` list indicates that all vertices have been visited.
