# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a 2D list of integers where each sublist has the same length m, representing a matrix. n is the number of rows in the matrix, and m is the number of columns. The function is not directly related to the problem description and input/output specifications provided, so it seems there might be a mismatch or misunderstanding in the given code snippet. However, based on the variables in the function signature, we can describe the following:

    m = len(l[0])

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute fully, setting `i` to `n + 1` and `j` to `m + 1`. The variable `m` will be a non-negative integer representing the width of the original 2D list `l`. After all iterations, `p[i][j]` will be calculated for all valid indices `i` from 1 to `n + 1` and `j` from 1 to `m + 1` using the formula `p[i][j] = p[i - 1][j] + p[i][j - 1] + l[i - 1][j - 1] - p[i - 1][j - 1]`. This results in a cumulative sum grid where each cell `p[i][j]` contains the sum of all elements in the subgrid of `l` from `(1,1)` to `(i,j)`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`, `j` will be `m + 1`, `m` will be a non-negative integer, and `p[i][j]` will contain the sum of all elements in the subgrid of `l` up to the current cell `(i,j)` for every valid `i` and `j`.

    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `d` will contain how many times each prime factor appears in the factorization of the original `num`. For example, if the initial `num` was 100 (which has prime factors 2 and 5), `d` might look like `{2: 2, 5: 2}` indicating that 2 appears twice and 5 appears twice in the factorization of 100. The variable `num` will be 1 because all its prime factors have been divided out. The `Prime_array` dictionary remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.

    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `x` until `x * x` exceeds `n`. Given that `n` is reduced to 1 after the third iteration (as seen in the output state after 3 iterations), `x` will eventually reach a value where `x * x > n`, which is when `x` becomes 6 (since \(5^2 = 25\) and \(6^2 = 36\), and `n` is 1). At this point, the loop terminates. The dictionary `d` contains the prime factorization of the original `n` (which we can infer was 36, since it gets reduced to 1 through the divisions by 2 and 3, each appearing three times).

The variable `i` will be set to 6, indicating that the loop has executed 5 more times beyond the first 3 iterations mentioned.

The value of `dearr` will keep appending new elements based on the formula provided, until the loop completes. Each new element in `dearr` is calculated as `(i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod`, with `mod` being implied to be a large number (typically 10^9 + 7 in such problems to avoid overflow). The final state of `dearr` will be a list of length `n + 1`, starting from the initial values `[1, 0]` and growing according to the loop's rule until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

Specifically, the loop continues to narrow down the range until it finds the greatest integer `mid` whose square is less than or equal to `x`. At that point, the function returns `mid`. This means that `mid` is the integer part of the square root of `x`, and `mid * mid` is the largest perfect square less than or equal to `x`.

    #Explanation: The loop continues to halve `b` (right shift operation) until `b` becomes zero. During each iteration, if the current bit of `b` is set (i.e., `b & 1` is true), `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `a` and taking modulo `mod`. This effectively accumulates the product of `a` raised to the power of the bits of `b` that are set. Since the loop halves `b` each time, it processes all bits of `b`, resulting in `ans` being equivalent to `a^b % mod` after the loop completes all its iterations.

    #
    #This final state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` running from 1 to `len(a) + 1` and `j` running from 1 to `len(b) + 1`. As a result, the `dp` table is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all possible prefixes of `a` and subsequences of `b`.

    #This final state occurs because the loop continues as long as `i` and `j` are not both zero. The loop modifies `i` and `j` based on comparisons of values in the `dp` table, appending characters from `a` to the list `l`. Once `i` and `j` both become zero, the loop terminates.

    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, each element from the original list `arr` has been processed exactly once. The loop maintains a sorted list `l` by inserting each element from `arr` at the correct position using binary search (via `bisect_left`).
