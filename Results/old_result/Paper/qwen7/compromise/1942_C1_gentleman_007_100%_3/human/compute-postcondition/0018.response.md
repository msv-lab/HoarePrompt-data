Output State: **`vis[node]` is 1, `node` is the next node in `graph[ver]`, and `q` contains the next node appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the `node` to the list `q`. This means that the `node` which was previously the next node in `graph[ver]` is now added to the list `q`. The value of `vis[node]` remains 1, and the state of `node` as the next node in `graph[ver]` is also retained. The list `q` now includes the next node that was appended.
