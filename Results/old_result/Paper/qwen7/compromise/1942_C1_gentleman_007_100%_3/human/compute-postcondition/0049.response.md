Output State: **`graph[ver]` must have at least one unvisited node, and the current value of `node` is unvisited; `q` now contains the node that was just appended.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the current `node` to the list `q`. Since `node` is unvisited, appending it to `q` means `q` now includes this node. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
