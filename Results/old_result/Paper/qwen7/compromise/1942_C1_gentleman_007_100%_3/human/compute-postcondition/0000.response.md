Output State: **`q` is a deque(), `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. Additionally, `vis` is a list or array of the same length as the number of vertices, initialized to 0, indicating whether each vertex has been visited.**

The code initializes an empty deque object `q`. The other variables (`ver`, `graph`, and `vis`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
