Output State: All nodes that are reachable from `ver` in the graph `graph` have `vis[node]` set to 1, and `q` contains all these nodes that were added during the loop executions. The variable `ver` retains its final value, which is the last node processed in the loop, and `graph` remains unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, every node that can be reached starting from `ver` through the graph's edges will have been visited, indicated by `vis[node]` being set to 1 for those nodes. The deque `q` will contain all such visited nodes. The specific node `ver` that was initially processed and any changes to it during the loop are not specified, so we assume it retains its final value from the last iteration. The graph structure itself does not change.
