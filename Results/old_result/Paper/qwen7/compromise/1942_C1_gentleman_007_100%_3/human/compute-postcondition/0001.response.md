Output State: **`q` is a deque containing `ver`, `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and `vis` is a list or array of the same length as the number of vertices, initialized to 0.**

The code `q.append(ver)` appends the integer `ver` to the deque `q`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
