Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `len(q)`. This means the loop will continue as long as the deque `q` is not empty.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `q` is a deque containing `ver`.
   - `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
   - `graph` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices.
   - `vis` is a list or array of the same length as the number of vertices, initialized to 0.
   - `vis[ver]` is set to 1.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `len(q)`, which checks if the deque `q` is not empty.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `q` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `q` currently contains `ver`, `q` is not empty and the loop will execute the first time.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the given state for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`q` is a deque containing `ver`, `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list or array of the same length as the number of vertices, initialized to 0, and `vis[ver]` is set to 1**.
