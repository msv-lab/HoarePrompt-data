Output State: **`q` is a list with one less element than before; `ver` is the first element of `q` before it was removed.**

Explanation: The code `ver = q.popleft()` removes the first element from the list `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. Since `q` must contain at least one element initially, after removing the first element, `q` will have one less element than before. The value of `ver` is now the element that was removed from `q`.
