Output State: **`q` is a deque containing `ver`, `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list or array of the same length as the number of vertices, initialized to 0, and `vis[ver]` is set to 1.**

In this output state, the `vis` list has been updated such that the element at index `ver` is now set to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. All other variables remain in their initial state as described in the initial state.
