Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` is a queue that now contains all elements except the first one because the first element (`ver`) was removed using `q.popleft()`.
- `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`.
- All elements in `graph[ver]` that were not previously visited have their corresponding `vis` flag set to 1.

When the `print(ver, end=' ')` statement is executed, it will print the value of `ver` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **ver (where ver is the first element that was removed from q)**
