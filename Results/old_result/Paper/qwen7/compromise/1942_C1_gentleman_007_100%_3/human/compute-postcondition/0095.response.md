Output State: **The program returns the reversed string 's' formed by joining the elements of list 'l' based on the optimal path traced through the 'dp' table.**

Explanation: The code `return s[::-1]` simply reverses the string `s`. Since `s` is constructed by joining the characters from list `l` based on the optimal path traced through the `dp` table, the program returns the reversed version of this string.
