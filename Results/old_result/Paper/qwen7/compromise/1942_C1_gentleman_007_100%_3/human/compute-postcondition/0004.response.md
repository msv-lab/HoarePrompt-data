Output State: **`q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after removing the first element, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` remains unchanged except for `vis[ver]` which is set to 1.**

In more detail, the code `ver = q.popleft()` removes the first element from the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. The value of `vis[ver]` is set to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. The `graph` dictionary and the rest of the `vis` list remain unchanged.
