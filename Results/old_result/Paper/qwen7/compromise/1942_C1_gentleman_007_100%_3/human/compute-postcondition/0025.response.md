Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` is a list with one less element than before.
- `ver` is the first element of `q` before it was removed.

The `print(ver, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `ver`, which is the first element of the list `q` before an element was removed from it.

Output: **ver (where ver is the first element of the list q before an element was removed)**
