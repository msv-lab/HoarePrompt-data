The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It then iterates `m` times, each time calling another function `func_1` to get the coordinates of a chosen vertex pair. For each pair, it marks both `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` as 1 in a 2D list `l` of size (n+1)x(n+1). After completing the iterations, it returns the 2D list `l` along with the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y`.
