Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is the maximum second smallest value found among all sublists of three consecutive elements in `a`, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing the last three elements which are sorted, `i` is `n-2`.

In this final state, `max` will hold the highest value that was the second smallest element in any of the sublists of three consecutive elements processed during the loop. The variable `temp` will contain the last three elements of the list `a` after it has been sorted, and `i` will be set to `n-2` since the loop runs from `range(n-2)`.
