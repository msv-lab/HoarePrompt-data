Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers converted from input.
   - `max` is either `temp[1]` if `temp[1] > max` or remains unchanged.
   - `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements starting from index `i`, and `temp` is sorted.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains the same (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1).
   - `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to 3).
   - `a` remains the same (list of integers).
   - `max` remains the same (either `temp[1]` if `temp[1] > max` or remains unchanged).
   - `temp` remains the same (sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements starting from index `i`, and `temp` is sorted).
   - `i` is now 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is either `temp[1]` if `temp[1] > max` or remains unchanged, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements starting from index `i`, and `temp` is sorted, `i` is 2**.
