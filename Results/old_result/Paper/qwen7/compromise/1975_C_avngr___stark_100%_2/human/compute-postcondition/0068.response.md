Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`, `max` is updated to the maximum second largest value found during the entire execution of the loop, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements, and `temp` is sorted after each iteration. Since the if part is executed when `n == 2`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition because there are no changes made to the variables within the if part.**
