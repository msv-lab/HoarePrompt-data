Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is 0, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements, and `temp` is sorted after each iteration.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `max`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain the same as the initial state. The overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
