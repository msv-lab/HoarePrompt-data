Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`, `max` is updated to the maximum second largest value found during the entire execution of the loop, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements, and `temp` is sorted after each iteration.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `max`, `temp`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and relationships, but the list `a` is now updated to contain integers.
