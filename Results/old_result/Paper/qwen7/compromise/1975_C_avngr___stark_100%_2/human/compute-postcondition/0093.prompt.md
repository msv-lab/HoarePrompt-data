Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, and `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`. The variable `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` containing three consecutive elements during each iteration but does not persist its value across iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`, `max` is updated to the maximum second largest value found during the entire execution of the loop, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements, and `temp` is sorted after each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is the maximum of the second smallest values (i.e., the second element) of all sublists of three consecutive elements in `a`, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing the last three elements of `a` which are sorted, `i` is `n-2`.

In this final state, `max` will hold the highest value among the second smallest values of all possible sublists of three consecutive elements in the list `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `n` remains the same as it was provided as input and not modified within the loop. The list `a` remains intact but is processed through the loop. The variable `temp` will contain the last three elements of `a` after the loop has completed, and these elements will be sorted. The variable `i` will be `n-2` because the loop runs from `range(n-2)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
