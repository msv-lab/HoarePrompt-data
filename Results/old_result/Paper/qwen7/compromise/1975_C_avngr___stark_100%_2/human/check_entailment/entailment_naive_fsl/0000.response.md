Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible value that the array can be made uniform through the described operations. Specifically, the program only considers the median of subarrays of length 3, which is insufficient to handle all cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

According to the problem description, Mocha can perform operations on any subarray. The correct approach would involve finding the median of the entire array or larger subarrays, not just subarrays of length 3. In this case, the median of the entire array is 3, but the program only considers the medians of subarrays of length 3, which leads to an incorrect result.

The correct solution should involve finding the minimum value in the array, as the maximum possible value that the array can be made uniform to is the minimum value in the array. This is because any subarray's median will eventually be set to the minimum value in the subarray during the operations.
