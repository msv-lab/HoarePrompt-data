Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 3.
2. `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements, but no specific values are given for `pans` other than this constraint.
3. `mak` is mentioned to remain unchanged, but its value is not specified in the initial state.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

- The string `'?'` will be printed first.
- `pans[mak]` will print the element at the index specified by `mak` in the list `pans`.
- `pans[i]` will print the element at the index `i` in the list `pans`, which is 3.

Since `pans` has at least 2 elements and `i` is 3, `pans[i]` will definitely refer to one of the elements in `pans`.

The output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]' where [pans[mak]] is the element at index mak in the list pans and [pans[i]] is the element at index 3 in the list pans**
