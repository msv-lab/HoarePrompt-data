Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the element `n-1`, and `s` is a string input from the user. If `s` is equal to `<`, `pans` remains as `[i]`. If `s` is equal to `=`, `pans` remains unchanged. If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `pans` remains unchanged.
