Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing 0, `s` is the string input by the user, which is either equal to '<' or '='**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered data is written out to the terminal. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
