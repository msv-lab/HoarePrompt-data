Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `n`, and `pans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `pans`. None of the other variables (`mak2`, `n`, `i`, `mak`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
