Output State: **`mak` is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), `mak2` equals `mak`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop executed.**

Explanation: The line `mak2 = mak` simply assigns the current value of `mak` to `mak2`. This does not change the value of `mak` itself or any other variables. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `t`, and `n` remain as they were in the initial state.
