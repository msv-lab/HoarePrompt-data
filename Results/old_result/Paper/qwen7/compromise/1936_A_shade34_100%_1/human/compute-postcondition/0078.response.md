Output State: **`mak` is equal to `i`, a string read from input is either greater than '>', or the input operation completes without further changes to variables, `len(pans)` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. This changes the value of `mak` from `i + 1` to `i`. The other conditions and the input operation remain unchanged.
