Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is now `[i]`, `s` is a string input from the user and its current value is '<'**.

Explanation: The code `pans = [i]` assigns the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to the first element of the list `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
