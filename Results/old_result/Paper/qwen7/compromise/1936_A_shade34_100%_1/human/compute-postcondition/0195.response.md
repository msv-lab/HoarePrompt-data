Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n`, and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `i` must be decremented from `n` to 0 (or until `i` is no longer less than `n`).
   - Therefore, `i` should start at `n-1` and decrement in each iteration until it reaches 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should start at `n-1` instead of `n`.
- `i` should be decremented in each iteration.

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, and `pans` is an empty list**.
