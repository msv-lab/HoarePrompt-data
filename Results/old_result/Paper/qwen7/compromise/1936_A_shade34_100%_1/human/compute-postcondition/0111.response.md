Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
