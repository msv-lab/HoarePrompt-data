Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: The line `mak2 = mak` assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Given the initial state where `mak` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is `n`, the value of `mak2` becomes `n-1`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
