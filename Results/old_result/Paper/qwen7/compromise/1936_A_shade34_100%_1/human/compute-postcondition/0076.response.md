Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is equal to `i + 1`.
- A string read from input is either greater than '>', or the input operation completes without further changes to variables.
- `len(pans)` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

1. `'?'`: This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
2. `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is equal to `i + 1`, this refers to the element at index `i + 1` in the list `pans`.
3. `pans[mak]`: This is the same as above, referring to the element at index `i + 1` in the list `pans`.
4. `pans[i]`: This refers to the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.
5. `pans[i]`: This is the same as above, referring to the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.

Given that `len(pans)` must be greater than `i + 1`, it confirms that both `pans[i]` and `pans[mak]` exist in the list.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[i+1]] [pans[i+1]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'** (where `[pans[i+1]]` is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `pans` and `[pans[i]]` is the element at index `i` in the list `pans`).
