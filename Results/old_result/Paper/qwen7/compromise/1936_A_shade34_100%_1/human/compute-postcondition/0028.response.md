Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` or `n`. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that any pending output is written to the console immediately. However, since no variables are assigned or modified within this line of code, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
