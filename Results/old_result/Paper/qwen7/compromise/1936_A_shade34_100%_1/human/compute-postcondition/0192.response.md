Output State: **n must be greater than 1, i is n, and mak is n.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` must still be greater than 1. The variable `i` will be equal to the final value of `n` since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`. Similarly, the variable `mak` will also be equal to `n` because each iteration checks if the input is '<' and if so, updates `mak` to the current value of `i`. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `mak` will end up being `n` if the input condition was met in every iteration.
