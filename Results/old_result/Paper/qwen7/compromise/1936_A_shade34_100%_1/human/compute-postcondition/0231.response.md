Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `i`, and possibly `i` again depending on the input string `s`. If `s` equals `'<'`, then `pans` contains `i` once. If `s` equals `'='`, then `pans` contains `i` twice. `s` is the input string from `input()`.
