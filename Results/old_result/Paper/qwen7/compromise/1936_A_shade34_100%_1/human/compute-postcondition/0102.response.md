Output State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation that does not change any variable states. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `i`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
