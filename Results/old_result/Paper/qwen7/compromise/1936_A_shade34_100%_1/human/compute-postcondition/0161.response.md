Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(pans) - 1` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `len(pans)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `len(pans)` is at least `1`.
   - If the input string is `'>',` then `mak` is `2`.
   - If the input string is not `'>',` then `i`, `len(pans)`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, the loop will continue if `i < len(pans)`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `3` in the next iteration.
   - `len(pans)` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The value of `mak` remains unchanged unless the input string is `'>',` but since no new information about the input string is provided, we assume `mak` remains `2` if it was `2` before, or remains unchanged otherwise.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `3`.
   - `len(pans)` remains at least `1`.
   - `mak` remains `2` if it was `2` before, or remains unchanged otherwise.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `len(pans)` is at least 1, if the input string is `'>',` then `mak` is 2.**
