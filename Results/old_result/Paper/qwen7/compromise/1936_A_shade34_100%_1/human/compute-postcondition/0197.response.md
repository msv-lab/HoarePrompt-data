Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, and `pans` is an empty list**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation that does not change any variable states. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
