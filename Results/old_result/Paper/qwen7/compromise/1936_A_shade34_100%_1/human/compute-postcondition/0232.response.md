Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `i`, and `i`, `s` is the input string from `input()`. If the input string `s` equals `'<'`, then `pans` is updated to contain `i` once. If the input string `s` equals `'='`, then `pans` is updated to contain `i` twice.
