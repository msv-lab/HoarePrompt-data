Output State: **`mak` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variable values or conditions. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the terminal. However, since no variables are modified or checked within this line of code, the values of `mak`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.
