Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is at least 1; `s` is a string that is not equal to '<'; `pans` is a list containing the integer 0.**

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `pans`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged. Therefore, `pans` now contains the integer 0.
