Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). However, the value of `t` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.

Therefore, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mak` (which is 0) twice, and the value of `i` twice (with both occurrences being the same since `i` is not defined).

Output: **'? 0 0 i i'**
