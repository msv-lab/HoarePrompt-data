Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing the integer 1, `s` is now an input string from user input.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pans` now contains the integer 1.
