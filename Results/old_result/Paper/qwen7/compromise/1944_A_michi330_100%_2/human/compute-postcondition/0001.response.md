Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer and `i` should start from 0 and increment until it reaches `t`.

Given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is mentioned that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), we need to ensure that `t` is within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the only variable that directly affects the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `t` is a valid positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)**.
