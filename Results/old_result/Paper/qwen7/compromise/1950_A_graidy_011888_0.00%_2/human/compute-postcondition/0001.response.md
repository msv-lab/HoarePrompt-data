The only variable in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.

Right before the loop, `i` is 1. Since `i` is already 1, it satisfies the condition `i <= 1000`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 1**
