Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(n)` to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`). If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - We also need to set `i` to 0 since that is the initial value it takes when the loop starts.

4. **Consider Other Given Variables**:
   - The variables `hd`, `res`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, and `t` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
