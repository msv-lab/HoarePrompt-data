Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the condition `i < n`.

2. **Determine the changes made inside the loop**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - The values of `hd` and `res` can change based on the conditions involving `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 2`.
   - `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`.
   - `i` is less than `n` and becomes `i + 1`.
   - If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `hd` is decremented by 1 to become `a1 - a2 - 3` and `res` is incremented by 1 to become `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`.
   - If `s1[i]` is not '1' or `s2[i]` is not '0', the values of `hd` and `res` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - We need to consider the possible changes to `hd` and `res` based on the conditions involving `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `hd` and `res` will either remain unchanged or change based on the conditions involving `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` at this point, we'll consider both scenarios:

**Scenario 1**: If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0':
- `hd` becomes `a1 - a2 - 3`.
- `res` becomes `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`.

**Scenario 2**: If `s1[i]` is not '1' or `s2[i]` is not '0':
- `hd` remains `a1 - a2 - 2`.
- `res` remains `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration can be represented as:

**State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 3` or `a1 - a2 - 2`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
