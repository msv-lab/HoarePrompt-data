Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `hd` is less than or equal to 0 (specifically, it will be \(- (n - 1)\) if `n` is greater than 1), `res` is incremented by 1 for each position where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i] is '0', `s1` is an input string, `s2` is a newly input string.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s2`. The values of `i`, `hd`, `res`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `s2` is the input provided by the user.
