Output State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 2`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is less than `n` and becomes `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `hd` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `a1 - a2 - 1` to `a1 - a2 - 2`. The values of `res`, `a1`, `a2`, `i`, `n` remain unchanged.
