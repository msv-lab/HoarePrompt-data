Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the value entered by the user as a string, `s2` is a string input by the user, `a1` is the number of '1's in the string `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1's in the string `s2`, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` (`a1`) and the number of '1's in `s2` (`a2`). This difference is stored in the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
