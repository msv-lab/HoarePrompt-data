Output State: **`res` is 1 more than its previous value, `n` must be greater than 0, and `hd` is now greater than 0 by -1. At the current index `i`, the value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the value of `s2[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1, making it 1 more than its previous value. The conditions for `n` and `hd` remain unchanged, and the values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` also remain the same as they were in the initial state.
