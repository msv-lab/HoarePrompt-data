Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `hd` is now greater than 0 by -1**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables `n` and `hd`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
