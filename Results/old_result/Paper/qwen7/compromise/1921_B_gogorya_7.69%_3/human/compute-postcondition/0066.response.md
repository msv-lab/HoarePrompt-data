Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is -1, and `res` is 1 if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `hd` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `res`, `s1`, and `s2`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
