Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.
   - `n`: This is the input integer provided.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`t`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, `res`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the only adjustments needed are related to `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
