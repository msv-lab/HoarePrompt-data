Based on the initial state provided:

- `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - n`
- `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + (n - 1)`
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`
- `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`

The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is `abs(a1 - a2) + (n - 1)`.

Output: **abs(a1 - a2) + (n - 1)**
