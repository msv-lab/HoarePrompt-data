Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is less than `n`. If `hd` is currently greater than 0 and the current character in `s1` at index `i` is '1' while the current character in `s2` at index `i` is '0', then `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` and `res` is updated to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`.
