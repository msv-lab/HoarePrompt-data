Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` equals `n`
- `hd` is `-n`
- `res` is the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' from the start up to the last iteration.

The print statement `print(res)` will print the value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the total count of positions where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' from the start up to the last iteration)**
