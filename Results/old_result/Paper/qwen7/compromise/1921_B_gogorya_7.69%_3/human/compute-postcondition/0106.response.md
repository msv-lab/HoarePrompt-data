Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `hd` is greater than 0, then `hd` is updated to either `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, and `res` remains unchanged. In all cases, the loop continues to the next iteration.
