Output State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is less than `n`, and if `hd` is currently greater than 0, then `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1`. The current value of `s1[i]` is '1', and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially equal to `abs(a1 - a2)`, after this operation, `res` becomes `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
