Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `hd` is decreased by 1 and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `i`, `n`, and `hd` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `hd` is decreased by 1 are still valid, and the loop continues.
