State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid value that allows the loop to run. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, it must be within this range.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
