### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Game Logic**: For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` in Alice's wallet and `b` in Bob's wallet.
3. **Winning Condition**: The key condition for determining the winner is based on the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. Specifically:
   - If the absolute difference (`|a - b|`) is even, Bob wins.
   - If the absolute difference is odd, Alice wins.

This logic aligns perfectly with the problem statement and the examples provided. The program correctly outputs "Bob" or "Alice" based on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd, respectively.

### Conclusion:

Given the provided annotated program, the logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
