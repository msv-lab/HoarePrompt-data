Output State: **number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9], the function returns the size of generated sequence.**

The provided code is a docstring for a function that generates a sequence of numbers based on an input number. However, the actual implementation of the function is missing. The docstring does not affect the variables' values but provides information about the function's behavior. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, and the function is expected to return the size of the generated sequence.
