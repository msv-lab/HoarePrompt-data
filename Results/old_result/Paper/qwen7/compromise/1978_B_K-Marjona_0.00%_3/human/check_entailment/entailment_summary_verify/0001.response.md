### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an appropriate value of \( k \).
   - The profit calculation depends on whether \( b \) (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price) is greater than or equal to \( a \) (the usual price of a bun).

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - If \( b \leq a \), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). This is because selling any bun at a lower price would result in a loss.
   - If \( b > a \), we need to find the optimal \( k \) to maximize profit. The optimal \( k \) is \( \min(n, b - a) \). This is because selling the first \( k \) buns at prices from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \) and the rest at \( a \) will yield the highest profit.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - For \( k \):
     - The sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{k(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \).
     - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is \( (n - k) \times a \).

4. **Implementation Verification:**
   - The given code correctly handles both cases:
     - If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \).
     - If \( b > a \), it calculates the optimal \( k \) and uses the formula to compute the total profit.
   - The code correctly computes the sum of the arithmetic series for the first \( k \) buns using the formula \( \frac{k(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when \( b \leq a \) and when \( k \) is large (up to \( \min(n, b - a) \)).
   - The code also correctly handles the case when \( k = 0 \), which means all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
