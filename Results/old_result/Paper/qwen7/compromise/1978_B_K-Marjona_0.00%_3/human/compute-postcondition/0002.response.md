Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed for each test case. For each test case, if \( b \leq a \), the output is \( a \times n \). Otherwise, the output is \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).

This means for each test case, the program calculates and prints either \( a \times n \) or a more complex expression based on the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), depending on whether \( b \) is less than or equal to \( a \).
