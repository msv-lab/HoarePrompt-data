Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list where each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) is set to `i`, `res` is a list containing one tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with `i - 1` as an argument. Given that `i` is initially 0, `i - 1` results in -1. Since `i - 1` is not a valid non-negative integer index for the list `arr`, the function `make_stairs` likely does nothing or returns without modifying the state of the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
