Postcondition: **`is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, `res` is a list containing one tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is equal to 0. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, then `i` is set to 0 and no changes are made to `arr` or `res`. Otherwise, each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) in `arr` is set to `i`, and `res` is updated to contain one tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.**
