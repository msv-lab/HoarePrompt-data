Functionality: **The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i` and modifies the list `arr` to form a "stair" pattern starting from index `start_index`. It also appends tuples to the list `res` indicating the range of indices modified. If `arr` already forms a valid stair pattern, it does nothing. The function ultimately ensures that each segment of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) is set to the value `i`, and updates `res` accordingly. The function returns `None`.**
