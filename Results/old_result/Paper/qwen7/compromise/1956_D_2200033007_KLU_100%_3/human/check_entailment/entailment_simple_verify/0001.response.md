### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided code. Let's re-evaluate the code step-by-step to confirm these issues and ensure that the provided functions do indeed fail to solve the problem as described.

#### Function `func_1`
1. **Base Case**: The base case `if start_index == end_index:` returns `max(1, arr[start_index])`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of setting the entire subarray to the MEX value, which could potentially maximize the sum.
2. **Recursive Case**: The recursive case attempts to split the array into two parts and compute the maximum sum for each part. However, it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. The function does not update the array elements to their MEX values, which is essential for maximizing the sum.
3. **Memoization**: While memoization is used, the logic inside the function does not correctly update the array elements to their MEX values, making the memoization ineffective.

#### Function `func_2`
1. **Max Value Calculation**: The function calculates the maximum value using `func_1`, which is flawed due to the issues in `func_1`.
2. **Operation Generation**: The function tries to generate operations based on the maximum value, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. It attempts to create "staircases" of increasing values, but this approach is overly complex and does not guarantee the correct solution.
3. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_2` do not correctly reflect the MEX operation and the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

#### Function `make_stairs`
1. **Staircase Creation**: This function is intended to create a staircase pattern in the array, but it is not used correctly within the context of the problem. It does not align with the requirement to maximize the sum by performing the MEX operation on subarrays.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the code, it is clear that the provided functions do not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. They do not handle the MEX operation and the sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
