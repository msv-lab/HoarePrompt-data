### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function attempts to calculate the maximum sum of a subarray using a recursive approach with memoization. However, the logic inside the function does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the function is trying to find the maximum sum of subarrays by splitting them recursively, but it does not consider the operation of setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function is supposed to find the optimal operations to achieve the maximum sum. However, the logic here is flawed. It tries to find a way to maximize the sum by considering different partitions of the array, but it does not implement the actual operation of setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray. The function `func_2` also does not clearly define how to achieve the maximum sum.

#### Function `make_stairs`:
This function is intended to create a staircase pattern in the array, but it does not directly relate to the problem of maximizing the sum. The logic in this function is not clear and does not seem to implement the required operation.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires setting a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray to maximize the sum of the array. The provided functions do not implement this logic.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the maximum sum of subarrays but does not perform the required operation.
3. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to find the optimal operations but does not correctly implement the operation of setting subarrays to MEX values.
4. **Function `make_stairs`**: This function tries to create a staircase pattern but does not relate to the problem of maximizing the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The functions do not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
