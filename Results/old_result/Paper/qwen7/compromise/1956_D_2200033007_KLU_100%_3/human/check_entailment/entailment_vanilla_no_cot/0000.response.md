Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be designed to solve the problem as described. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements using the specified operation, but the functions appear to be attempting to solve a different problem related to finding the maximum value in subarrays, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

2. **Missing Main Logic**: There is no main logic in the provided code that iterates over the array and applies the allowed operations to maximize the sum. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not interact with the array in a way that would lead to the desired result.

3. **No Operation Application**: The code does not apply any operations to the array to change its values according to the problem's requirements. Instead, it seems to be focused on some form of recursive calculation that is not aligned with the problem statement.

4. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `make_stairs` is also incomplete and does not serve the purpose intended for solving the problem. It appears to be an attempt to create a staircase pattern in the array, which is not relevant to the problem's goal of maximizing the sum through the specified operations.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement logic that iteratively selects subarrays and applies the operation to set all elements in the subarray to the MEX value of that subarray, aiming to maximize the sum of the array. The solution should involve dynamic programming or greedy algorithms to efficiently find and apply these operations.
