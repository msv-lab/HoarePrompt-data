### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided code is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to calculate the maximum sum of subarrays using a recursive approach. However, it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. The recursive logic is flawed because it does not update the array elements to their MEX values, which is essential for maximizing the sum.
   - The base case and recursive cases do not properly reflect the problem requirements. For instance, the base case `if start_index == end_index:` returns `max(1, arr[start_index])`, which is not relevant to the problem since we want to maximize the sum, and setting the element to 1 might not be optimal.
   - The memoization dictionary `res_dict` is used, but the logic inside the function does not correctly update the array elements to their MEX values, making the memoization ineffective.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. However, it also seems flawed:
     - The function calculates the maximum value (`max_value`) using `func_1`, which is already flawed as explained above.
     - The function tries to generate operations based on the maximum value, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. It attempts to create "staircases" of increasing values, but this approach is overly complex and does not guarantee the correct solution.
     - The recursive calls in `func_2` do not correctly reflect the MEX operation and the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is intended to create a staircase pattern in the array, but it is not used correctly within the context of the problem. It does not align with the requirement to maximize the sum by performing the MEX operation on subarrays.

Given these issues, the provided functions do not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. They do not handle the MEX operation and the sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the MEX operation on subarrays.
