Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` converted to integer, `lst` has had its second element (index 1) removed.**

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. Since `1 * 2` equals 2, the element at index 2 is removed. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
