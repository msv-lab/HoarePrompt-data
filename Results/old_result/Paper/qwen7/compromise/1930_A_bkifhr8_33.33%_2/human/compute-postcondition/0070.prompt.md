Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` on spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` converted to an integer, and the second element of `lst` (index 1) has been removed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. If the length of `lst` is not 2, then `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` is modified by removing the element at index 1, and `ans` is updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` (or `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[2])` depending on the condition), and the previous value of `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
