Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially increased by 1 (implying `i` starts from 1).
   - `n` is an unknown variable that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, it needs to be adjusted to `i` being 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n * 2`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 (since `i` starts from 1, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute).

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `ans` is 0, but it is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` on spaces, but it is also not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
