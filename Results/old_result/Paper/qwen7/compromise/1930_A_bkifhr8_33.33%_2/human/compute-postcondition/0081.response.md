Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, the length of `lst` is now 1, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.**

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is index `0`, from the list `lst`. Since the initial length of `lst` is not equal to 2, it means `lst` has at least two elements initially. After removing the first element, the length of `lst` becomes 1. The value of `ans` remains unchanged because the removal of the first element does not affect the calculation of `ans` which was based on the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` before the removal.
