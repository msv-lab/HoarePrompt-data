Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is not 2, or 0 plus twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is 2; `i` is 3 if `len(lst)` is not 2, and `i` is 2 if `len(lst)` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
