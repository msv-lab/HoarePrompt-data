Output State: **`ans_f` contains the last computed `ans`, `i` is equal to `n * 2`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less.**

Explanation: The line `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less also remains valid.
