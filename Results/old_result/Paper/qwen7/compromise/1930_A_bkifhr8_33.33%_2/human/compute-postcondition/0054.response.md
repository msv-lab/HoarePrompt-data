Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n * 2):`.
   - The relevant variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - The postcondition from the previous iteration is that if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` converted to an integer, and the second element of `lst` (index 1) has been removed.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in each iteration of the for loop, and it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Given these points, we can now construct the new state:

- `i` will be 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**.
