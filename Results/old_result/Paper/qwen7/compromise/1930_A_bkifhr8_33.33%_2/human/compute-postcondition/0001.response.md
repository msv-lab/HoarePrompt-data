Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `n` is an unspecified integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `ans_f` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans_f`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, `t` remains the input integer, `n` remains an unspecified integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `ans_f` is an empty list.
