Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of List Length**: The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect because the list `lst` should be processed in pairs until all elements are removed. This condition will cause the loop to terminate prematurely when the list length is not exactly 2.

2. **Indexing Error**: The line `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` is incorrect. It should simply remove the first two elements from the list without using multiplication.

3. **Break Statement Misuse**: The `break` statement is used incorrectly. It should be removed since we need to process all elements in the list.

4. **Input Parsing**: The input parsing for the list of numbers can be simplified and made more robust.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = 0
        while lst:
            x, y = lst.pop(0), lst.pop(0)
            ans += min(x, y)
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum values are added to the score and the list is processed correctly until all elements are removed.
