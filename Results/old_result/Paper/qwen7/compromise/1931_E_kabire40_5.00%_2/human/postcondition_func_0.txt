The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings and a list of integers. It constructs a new string by reversing some elements of the list based on their indices and then checks if a power of 10 (determined by one of the input strings) is greater than or equal to the numeric value of the constructed string. Depending on the result of this comparison, it prints either 'Anna' or 'Sasha'.
