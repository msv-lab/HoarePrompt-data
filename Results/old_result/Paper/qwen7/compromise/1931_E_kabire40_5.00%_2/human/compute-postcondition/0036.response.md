Output State: **`x` is 1, `rev_val` contains at least one element, `val_in` is an integer equal to the reversed string of `rev_val[1]`, `rev_res` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `val_in = int(rev_val[x])` takes the value of `rev_val` at index `x`, which is `1` in this case, reverses the string, and converts it to an integer. Since `x` is `1`, `val_in` is set to the integer value of the reversed string of `rev_val[1]`. The other variables (`rev_val` and `rev_res`) remain unchanged.
