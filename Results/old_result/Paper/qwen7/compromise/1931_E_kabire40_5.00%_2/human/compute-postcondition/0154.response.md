Output State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is `k + 2`, `val_in` is the element at index `k + 2` in `rev_val`, `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus the reverse of `val_in`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += val_in[::-1]` takes the element at index `k + 2` in `rev_val` (which is stored in `val_in`), reverses it using `[::-1]`, and adds it to `rev_res`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `rev_res` now includes the reversed version of `val_in`.
