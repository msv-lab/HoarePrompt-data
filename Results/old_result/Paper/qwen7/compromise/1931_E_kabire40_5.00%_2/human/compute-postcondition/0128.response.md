Output State: **`operational_list` must contain at least two fewer elements, `x` is undefined, `rev_res` is `rev_res` + 0**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` attempts to add the value of `x` to `rev_res`. However, since `x` is undefined, the addition cannot be performed directly. In Python, adding an undefined variable to another variable results in the original value of the second variable being unchanged. Therefore, `rev_res` remains as it was before the operation. The other variables remain unchanged as well.
