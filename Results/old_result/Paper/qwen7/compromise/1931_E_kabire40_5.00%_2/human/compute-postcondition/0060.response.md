Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `x`.
   - The iterable is `operational_list`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables:**
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input.
   - `rev_val` is an empty list (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `rev_res` is an empty string (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `list_len` is the first value from input split by space (not directly used in the loop but might be relevant for other conditions).
   - `max_power` is the second value from input split by space (not directly used in the loop but might be relevant for other conditions).
   - `y` is equal to `int(input())` (not directly used in the loop but might be relevant for other conditions).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `operational_list`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(operational_list)` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `operational_list` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `operational_list` must have at least one element.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element**.
