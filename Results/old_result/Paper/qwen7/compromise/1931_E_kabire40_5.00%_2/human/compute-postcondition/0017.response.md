Postcondition: `operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first element; `x` is the second element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.
