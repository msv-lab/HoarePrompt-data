Postcondition: **`rev_res` is a string constructed by appending the string representation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]` for even indices `x` and the reverse of the string at odd indices `x`. `max_power` is an integer. The current value of `rev_res` satisfies the condition that `10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res)`**.
