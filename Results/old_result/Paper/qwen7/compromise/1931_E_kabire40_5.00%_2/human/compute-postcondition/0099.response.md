Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together, `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`, `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`, `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided, `x` is now equal to `k + 1`, `len(rev_val)` remains the same, `rev_res` is updated based on the value of `(k + 1) % 2`: if `(k + 1) % 2 == 0`, `rev_res` is unchanged; otherwise, `rev_res` is either appended with the integer value of the string at index `k + 1` in `rev_val` (if `(k + 1) % 2 == 0`) or with the reverse of the string at index `k + 1` in `rev_val` (if `(k + 1) % 2 == 1`), and `val_in` is assigned the integer value of the string at index `k + 1` in `rev_val` if `(k + 1) % 2 == 0` or the reversed string of the element at index `k + 1` in `rev_val` if `(k + 1) % 2 == 1`**.
