Output State: **`operational_list` has been processed, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original, and `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original.**

The code `rev_val.sort()` sorts the `rev_val` list in ascending order. The other variables (`operational_list` and `rev_res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `operational_list` has been processed, `rev_val` is now a sorted list of the reversed strings (where the lengths differ), and `rev_res` remains as a string containing all elements from `operational_list` where the lengths of the reversed strings are the same.
