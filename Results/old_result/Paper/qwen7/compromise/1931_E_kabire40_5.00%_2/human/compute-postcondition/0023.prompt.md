Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` is a list containing the split elements of the input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string representation of the first element in `operational_list`; if `len(str(x_rev)) == len(x)`, then `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus `x_rev`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list with one element which is the reverse of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first element; `x` is the second element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first two elements; `x` is the third element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`; if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`; otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
