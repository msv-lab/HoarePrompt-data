Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be equal to the total number of elements in `rev_val` - 1, `rev_res` will be a string that has been built by concatenating the string representations of integers when `x` is even and the reversed strings when `x` is odd, and `rev_val` will contain all its original elements as it was not modified within the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `x` will hold the index of the last element processed in `rev_val`. The variable `rev_res` will be a concatenated string formed by adding the string representation of the integer values of the elements in `rev_val` when the iteration index `x` is even, and the reversed string of those elements when `x` is odd. The list `rev_val` remains unchanged as no modifications were made to it inside the loop.
