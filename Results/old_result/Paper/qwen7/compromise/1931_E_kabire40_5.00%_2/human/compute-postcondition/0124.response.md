Postcondition: `operational_list` contains at least one fewer element, `x` is no longer defined. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` now includes the reverse of the last value of `x`, and `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`.
