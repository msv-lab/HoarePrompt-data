Output State: **`operational_list` is empty, `rev_val` contains the reverse of each element in the original `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string does not match the original string's length, sorted in ascending order, and `rev_res` is a string that contains the sum (concatenated as strings) of all elements from the original `operational_list` whose reversed length matches the original length.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.sort()` sorts the `rev_val` list in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the emptiness of `operational_list` or the content of `rev_res`. Therefore, `operational_list` remains empty, `rev_val` contains the reverse of each element in the original `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string does not match the original string's length, and `rev_res` is a string that contains the sum (concatenated as strings) of all elements from the original `operational_list` whose reversed length matches the original length. The only change is that `rev_val` is now sorted.
