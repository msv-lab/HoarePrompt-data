Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings and must have at least one element.
   - `x` is the next element in the list.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over each element in `operational_list`.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - If the length of the reverse of `x` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by the integer value of the reverse of `x`.
   - Otherwise, `x` is added to `rev_val` as a reversed string.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings and must have at least one element.
   - `x` is the next element in the list.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `operational_list` must still have elements.
   - Since `x` was the next element in the list during the previous iteration, it means `operational_list` had at least two elements before this iteration started.
   - After processing `x`, the next element in the list becomes the new `x`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `operational_list` should now have one less element (since `x` was processed).
   - `x` should be the next element in the updated `operational_list`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `operational_list` must have at least one element left.
- `x` should be the next element in the updated `operational_list`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list**.
