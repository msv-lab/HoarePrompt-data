Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over the `operational_list` using the variable `x`. Therefore, the variables `operational_list`, `x`, `x_rev`, `rev_res`, and `rev_val` are relevant to the loop head.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `operational_list`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first element.
   - `x` is the second element in the list.
   - `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`.
   - If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`.
   - Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `operational_list`, the next element in `operational_list` will be processed.
   - `x` will now be the third element in the list (since it was the second element in the previous iteration).
   - `x_rev` will be the integer value of the reverse of this new `x`.
   - Depending on the condition, either `rev_res` will be updated or `rev_val` will be updated accordingly.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `operational_list` will lose its first element (the current `x`), and the list will shift.
   - `x` will be the third element in the list.
   - `x_rev` will be the integer value of the reverse of this new `x`.
   - The conditions for updating `rev_res` and `rev_val` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first two elements; `x` is the third element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`; otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**
