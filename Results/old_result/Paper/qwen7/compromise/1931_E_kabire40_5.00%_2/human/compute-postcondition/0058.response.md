Output State: **`x` is equal to the total number of elements in `rev_val` - 1, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is the first value from input split by space, `max_power` is the second value from input split by space, and `y` is equal to `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The code `list_len, max_power = input().split()` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts based on a space, and assigns these parts to `list_len` and `max_power` respectively. The other variables (`rev_val`, `rev_res`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
