Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`; `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` updates the variable `rev_res` by adding the value of `x` to it. Since the initial value of `x` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`, `rev_res` now holds the value of its previous content plus `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
