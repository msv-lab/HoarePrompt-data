Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list. If the length of the reverse of `x` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by the integer value of the reverse of `x`. Otherwise, `x` is added to `rev_val` as a reversed string.**
