Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list (after reversing it and converting to integer), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`; `rev_val` is a list with the element `x[::-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reverse of the string `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` is a string, `x[::-1]` reverses the string. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
