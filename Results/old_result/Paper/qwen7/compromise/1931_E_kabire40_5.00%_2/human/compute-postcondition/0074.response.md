Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list (after reversing it and converting to integer), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_res` is the sum of `rev_res` and `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x` to `rev_res`. Since `x` is the next element in the list after reversing it and converting to an integer, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, the value of `rev_res` is updated to include `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
