Output State: **`operational_list` contains at least one fewer element, `x` is no longer defined, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer, storing it in `x_rev`. After this operation, `x` is no longer needed and is no longer defined in the state, while `x_rev` holds the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. The precondition that `operational_list` contains at least one fewer element remains unchanged.
