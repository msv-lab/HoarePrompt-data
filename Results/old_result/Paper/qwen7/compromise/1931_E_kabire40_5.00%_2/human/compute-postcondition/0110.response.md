Output State: **`rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of 10 that fits into the input string.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string into two parts using the `split()` method, assigning the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`. Since the initial state of `rev_val` and `rev_res` is an empty list and an empty string respectively, these remain unchanged. The values of `list_len` and `max_power` are derived from the input string.
