Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `rev_val`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index `x` in the range of `len(rev_val)`. This means `x` will iterate over all indices of `rev_val`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `rev_val` must have at least 1 element.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `rev_res` is constructed based on whether `x` is even or odd.

4. **Analyze the Loop Execution**:
   - If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.
   - If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.

5. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through all indices of `rev_val`, the next value of `x` will be the current value of `x` incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `rev_val` must still have at least 1 element (which it does, as per the postcondition).

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `x` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `rev_res` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

Given the above analysis, let's assume the current value of `x` is `k` (where `k` is the last processed index). For the next iteration, `x` will be `k + 1`.

Since `rev_val` must have at least 1 element and `x` is an integer, the only thing that changes is the value of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is an integer and equals `k + 1`, and `rev_res` is constructed as specified.**
