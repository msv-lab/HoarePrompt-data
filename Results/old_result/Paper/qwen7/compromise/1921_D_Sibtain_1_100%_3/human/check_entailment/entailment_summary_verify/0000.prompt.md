You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):
            print(0)
            continue
        a.sort()
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        (i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
            if t2 > t1:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
            ans += max(t1, t2)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n and m, along with two lists a and c. It first checks if the values in lists a and c are identical and constant across all elements. If so, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it sorts list a in ascending order and list c in descending order. For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted lists a and c, printing the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the arrays `a` and `c` contain duplicate values correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that `a` and `c` will always have unique elements, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4 6
1 1 1 1
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

The program will sort `a` and `c` and then pair the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, and vice versa. However, since all elements in `a` are the same, the program will incorrectly calculate the differences, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach would be to handle duplicates properly, ensuring that the maximum difference is calculated for each element in `a` against the corresponding elements in `c`.

A correct implementation would need to account for the possibility of duplicate values in both `a` and `c`.
