Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly addresses the problem. Here's a brief explanation of why:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code handles the edge case where all elements in `a` and `c` are the same, resulting in a total difference of 0.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: It sorts both arrays `a` and `c` to maximize the differences. By sorting `c` in reverse, it ensures that the largest elements in `c` are matched with the smallest elements in `a`, and vice versa, which helps in maximizing the differences.

3. **Iterative Matching**: The code iteratively matches elements from both ends of the sorted arrays to ensure the maximum possible difference is achieved. This approach ensures that the largest possible values in `c` are used to maximize the difference with the smallest values in `a`.

4. **Accumulating Differences**: The total difference is accumulated by taking the maximum difference at each step, ensuring that the overall difference is maximized.

Given these points, the provided solution is correct and should work as expected for the given problem constraints.
