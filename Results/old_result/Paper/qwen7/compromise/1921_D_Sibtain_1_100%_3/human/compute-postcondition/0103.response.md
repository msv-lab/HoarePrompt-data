Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`, and since the list `a` is sorted in descending order and the length of `a` is 1, `ans` remains unchanged as the maximum value of the single element in the list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `i` to 0, `j` to 1, and `ans` to 0. Since the initial state of `ans` was defined as the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`, and given that `a` is sorted in descending order and its length is 1, `ans` remains unchanged as the maximum value of the single element in the list. Therefore, the updated values are `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `ans` retains its initial value as the maximum value of the single element in the list.
