Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

The code `c.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `c` in descending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
