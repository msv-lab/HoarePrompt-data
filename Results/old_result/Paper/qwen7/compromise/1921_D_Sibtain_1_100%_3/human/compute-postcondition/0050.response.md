Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is decremented by 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is equal to the length of list `a`.
- `len(a)` is the number of integers entered.
- `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
- `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`.
- `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop.
- `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
- `c` is a list of integers entered by the user.

The print statement is `print(0)`. This statement directly prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
