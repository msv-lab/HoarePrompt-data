Output State: **`k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `ans` is increased by `t1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` to `t2`. This does not affect the values of `k`, `t1`, or `ans`. The value of `t2` is now updated, but its relationship with `t1` and `j` remains as per the initial conditions. The value of `ans` is increased by `t1` as stated in the initial state.
