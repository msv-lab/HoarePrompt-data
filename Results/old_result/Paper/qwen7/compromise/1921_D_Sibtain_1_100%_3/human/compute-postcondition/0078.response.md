Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[-1] - c[-1])`, `k` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans += max(t1, t2)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to the current value of `ans`. Since `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2` is `abs(a[-1] - c[-1])`, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`. The values of `i`, `j`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial values.
