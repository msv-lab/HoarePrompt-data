Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, and `m` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
