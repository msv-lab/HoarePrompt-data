Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is abs(a[i] - c[i])**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` to the variable `t1`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t1` is updated to the absolute difference of these two values. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0.
