Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a` plus the max value for the current iteration (which is the fourth iteration). This holds true if the sets of list `a` and list `c` contain only one unique element and the first elements of both lists are equal.**
