Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged, and `n` is replaced by the first element of the input list since `input().split()` without specifying a delimiter defaults to splitting on whitespace. However, since `n` and `m` are not part of the list `a`, they retain their original values from the initial state.
