Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, and `k` is 3.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The values of `t1` and `t2` are defined as `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `abs(a[2] - c[2])` respectively. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged from their initial values. Since the conditions for changing `i` and `j` are not met (as they depend on the comparison between `t1` and `t2` which is not specified), `i` remains 1 and `j` remains 2.
