Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` is 1, we continue the loop or statement we were inside.
