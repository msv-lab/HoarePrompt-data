Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `k` which ranges over the length of the list `a`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `len(a)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is either 1 or 2.
   - `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.
   - `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `k` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration (assuming the loop continues).
   - If `k` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration (assuming the loop continues).

5. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: The loop will continue as long as `k < len(a)`. Therefore, `k` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the above points, let's determine the new state:

- If `k` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- If `k` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

Since `k` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to continue, we assume `k` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration (as it is the most common scenario unless otherwise specified).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`**.
