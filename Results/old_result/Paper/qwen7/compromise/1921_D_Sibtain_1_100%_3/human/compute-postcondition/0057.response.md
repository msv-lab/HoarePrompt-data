The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables or affect the values of existing variables, it only changes the flow of the loop. Given that the initial state includes the conditions and values of the variables, and the `continue` statement does not alter these values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is decremented by 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `a` is sorted in reverse order, `c` is a list of integers entered by the user and sorted in reverse order, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`, the sets of `a` and `c` contain only one unique element and the first elements of `a` and `c` are equal.**
