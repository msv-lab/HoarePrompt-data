Output State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`**.

The code `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` calculates the absolute difference between the elements `a[i]` and `c[i]` and assigns it to `t1`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `a` and `c`, `t1` is expressed as the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. The variables `k` and `len(a)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
