Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` and `m` are integers from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a string input and converting each element to an integer.
- `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

It is also mentioned that all elements in `a` and `c` are the same, and there is only one unique element in both lists.

Given this information, the `print(0)` statement will simply print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
