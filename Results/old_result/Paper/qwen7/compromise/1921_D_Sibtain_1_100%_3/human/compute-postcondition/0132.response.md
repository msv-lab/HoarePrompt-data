Based on the initial state described:

- `k` is equal to the length of list `a`.
- `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`.
- `i` and `j` are adjusted based on the comparisons within the loop.
- `t1` and `t2` reflect the absolute differences calculated in the last iteration of the loop.

When the print statement `print(ans)` is executed, it will print the value of `ans`, which is the cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(t1, t2) for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`)**
