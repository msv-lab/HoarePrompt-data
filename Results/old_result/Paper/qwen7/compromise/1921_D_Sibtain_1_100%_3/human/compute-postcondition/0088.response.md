Output State: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`.

Explanation: After analyzing the provided information, it appears that the loop terminates when either `i` or `j` reaches the length of list `a`. The loop increments `i` or `j` based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2`, and updates `ans` with the maximum of `t1` and `t2` at each step. Given that the loop has executed up to the third iteration and `i` remains 1 while `j` is 2, we can infer that the loop will continue to increment `j` until `j` equals the length of `a`. Since `i` is already 1 and cannot be incremented further without exceeding the length of `a`, `i` will remain 1 throughout the loop's execution. Therefore, the final state will have `i` as 1, `j` equal to the length of `a`, and `ans` as the cumulative sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration.
