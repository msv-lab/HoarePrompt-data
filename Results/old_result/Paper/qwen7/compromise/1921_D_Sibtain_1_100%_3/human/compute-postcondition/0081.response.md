Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `k` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. Given that `j` is 2, `len(a)` and `len(c)` are assumed to be at least 2 (since `a[1]` and `c[1]` are used), so `t2` becomes `abs(a[2] - c[2])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
