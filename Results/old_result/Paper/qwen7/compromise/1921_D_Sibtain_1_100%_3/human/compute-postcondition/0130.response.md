Output State: `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`, `i` and `j` are adjusted based on the comparisons within the loop, and `t1` and `t2` reflect the absolute differences calculated in the last iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `k` will be equal to the length of list `a` because the loop runs from `k` in `range(len(a))`. The variable `ans` accumulates the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, which means it will hold the total sum of these maximum values. The variables `i` and `j` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop, and `t1` and `t2` will reflect the absolute differences calculated in the last iteration of the loop.
