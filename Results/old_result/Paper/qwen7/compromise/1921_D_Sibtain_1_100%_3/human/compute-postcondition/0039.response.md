Output State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously set to 1 (based on the initial state), after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. All other variables (`k`, `len(a)`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
