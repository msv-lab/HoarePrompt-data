Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[-1] - c[-1])`, `k` is 2**

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `c`. Since the initial value of `j` is 1, `len(a) - j` gives the index of the last element in list `a`, which is `len(a) - 1`. Similarly, `len(c) - j` gives the index of the last element in list `c`, which is `len(c) - 1`. The value of `t2` is updated to `abs(a[-1] - c[-1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
