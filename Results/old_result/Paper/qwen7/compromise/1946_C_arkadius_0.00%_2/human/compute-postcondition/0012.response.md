Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times because it runs from `i` starting at 1 up to but not including `n`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`. `n` and `k` will remain as they were initially. The variable `tree` will represent a fully connected tree with `n` vertices, as every possible edge between the vertices has been added through the loop. Each iteration adds one more edge to the tree, so after `n-1` iterations, there will be exactly `n-1` edges in the tree. Therefore, the final state will be: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `tree` is an instance of a custom Tree class that now includes `n-1` edges connecting all `n` vertices.
