Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `[u, v]` is a list containing two integers obtained from input, and a new edge `(u - 1, v - 1)` has been added to the tree.**

Explanation: The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree. The variables `i`, `n`, `k`, and the list `[u, v]` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is the addition of the specified edge to the tree.
