Output State: **`beg` is an integer, `end` is now `mid` - 1, and `mid` is equal to (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The value of `end` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `beg` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
