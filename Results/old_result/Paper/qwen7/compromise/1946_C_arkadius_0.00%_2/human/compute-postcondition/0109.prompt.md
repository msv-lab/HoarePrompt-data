You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a class representing a tree structure where each vertex has a `children` list of its child vertices, a `good_components` attribute initialized to 0, and a `remaining_size` attribute initialized to the size of the subtree rooted at that vertex. s is an integer representing the starting vertex, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
        
    #State: For each vertex `v` in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` contains the total count of good components from all descendants of `v`, considering the size constraints. Specifically, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1 if any descendant's `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, or by the `good_components` value of that descendant otherwise. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` holds the sum of `remaining_size` values of all descendants that meet the size constraint `x`. The `tree.vertices[v].children` list is empty for all vertices as all children have been processed.
    return tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size
    #The program returns the tuple (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a tree (an instance of a class representing a tree structure), a starting vertex `s`, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. It returns a tuple containing the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at vertex `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the tuple (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
