Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The stack will contain a series of tuples where each tuple is of the form (u, False), specifically one tuple for each child of v in tree.vertices[v].children, indicating that each corresponding child node has not yet been fully processed. The current state of the program satisfies the condition (postorder).
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either 1 or `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, `tree.vertices[v].children'` must contain at least one element, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to either `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` or remains unchanged based on the condition of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, `tree.vertices[v].children'` must contain at least one fewer element, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to either `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` or remains unchanged based on the condition of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either 1 or `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, `tree.vertices[v].children'` must contain at least one fewer element, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to either `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` or remains unchanged based on the condition of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
