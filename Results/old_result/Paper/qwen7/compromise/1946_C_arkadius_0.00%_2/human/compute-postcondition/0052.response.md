Postcondition: **`stack` must contain at least one tuple of the form (child_vertex, False), where child_vertex is a child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`; `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`; `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
