Output State: **The stack is a non-empty list containing one additional tuple `(v, True)` at the end, `v` is the first element of that tuple, and `postorder` is the second element of that tuple.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((v, True))` adds a new tuple `(v, True)` to the end of the stack. The stack was initially a non-empty list containing tuples representing vertices from the tree, with the last tuple being popped. Now, the stack contains all its original elements plus the new tuple `(v, True)`. The values of `v` and `postorder` remain unchanged.
