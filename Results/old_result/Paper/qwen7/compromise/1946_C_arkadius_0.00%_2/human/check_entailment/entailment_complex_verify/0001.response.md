### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. We'll focus on the core logic and ensure that each function is correctly implemented and used.

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling**:
   - The `Tree` class correctly represents the tree structure with vertices and edges.
   - The input handling in `func_5` is correct. It reads the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges to be removed `k`, and constructs the tree by adding edges.

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - **`func_2`**: This function correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at `v`. It uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and update the counts.
   - **`func_1`**: This function is intended to process the tree to determine the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges. However, the logic is flawed. It uses a postorder traversal, which is not appropriate for this problem. Instead, it should directly calculate the counts without the need for a postorder traversal.
   - **`func_3`**: This function checks if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. The logic here is flawed because it uses `func_1` which is incorrect. Instead, it should use `func_2` to get the correct counts and check if the conditions are met.
   - **`func_4`**: This binary search function tries to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and have each remaining component with at least `x` vertices. The logic here is correct if the helper functions were working as intended.
   - **`func_5`**: This function handles the input and calls the necessary functions to solve the problem.

### Detailed Issues

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of good components and remaining size after removing edges, but the logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It should not be using a postorder traversal for this purpose. Instead, it should directly calculate the counts.
   - `func_2` is correctly calculating the number of good components and remaining size for a subtree, but it is being called incorrectly by `func_1`.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_3`**:
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` which is incorrect. Instead, it should use `func_2` to get the correct counts and check if the conditions are met.

3. **Binary Search in `func_4`**:
   - The binary search in `func_4` is correct in terms of the approach, but it relies on the incorrect helper functions.

### Corrected Approach

To fix the program, we need to correct the logic in `func_1` and `func_3`:

- **`func_1`**: Directly calculate the number of good components and remaining size without using a postorder traversal.
- **`func_3`**: Use `func_2` to get the correct counts and check if the conditions are met.

Here is the corrected `func_1` and `func_3`:

```python
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
        
    return tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size

def func_3(tree, n, k, x):
    good_components, remaining_size = func_1(tree, 0, x)
    if good_components > k:
        return True
    if good_components == k and remaining_size >= x:
        return True
    return False
```

With these corrections, the program should work correctly.
