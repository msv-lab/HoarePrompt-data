Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction**: The `func_5` function correctly constructs the tree by reading the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `k` to be removed, then adding edges to the tree using the `add_edge` method. After constructing the tree, it roots the tree non-recursively using `root_tree_non_recursive`.

2. **Rooting the Tree**: The `root_tree_non_recursive` function correctly performs a depth-first search to assign parents and calculate subtree sizes. This ensures that the tree structure is properly rooted and that each node knows its parent and the size of its subtree.

3. **Finding Good Components**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex. It uses a post-order traversal to ensure that all children are processed before their parent.

4. **Recursive Calculation**: The `func_2` function is a helper function used by `func_1` to recursively calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree. It correctly propagates the results up the tree.

5. **Checking Conditions**: The `func_3` function checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`. This function correctly determines if the conditions for the problem are met.

6. **Binary Search for Maximum Size**: The `func_4` function uses binary search to find the maximum size `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and have each remaining connected component of size at least `x`. It correctly narrows down the search space by adjusting the bounds `beg` and `end` based on the results of `func_3`.

Given that all the functions work correctly and together they solve the problem as described, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
