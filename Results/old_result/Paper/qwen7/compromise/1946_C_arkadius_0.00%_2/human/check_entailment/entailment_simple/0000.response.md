Reasoning:
1. **Tree Representation**: The program correctly uses a class `TreeNode` to represent each node in the tree, including attributes like `edges`, `children`, `subtree_size`, `parent`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`. This representation is consistent throughout the program.

2. **Tree Construction**: The program constructs the tree by adding edges and rooting the tree using the `root_tree_non_recursive` method. This ensures that the tree structure is properly built before further operations.

3. **Postorder Traversal**: Functions `func_1` and `func_2` perform a postorder traversal of the tree to calculate the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each node. This traversal ensures that all child nodes are processed before their parent nodes, which is crucial for calculating these values correctly.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Size**: Function `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum size `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. The binary search is implemented correctly, with the appropriate conditions for updating the search range.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the number of good components is greater than `k` or when the remaining size meets the criteria. These checks are implemented correctly in `func_3`.

Given that the program correctly constructs the tree, performs the necessary traversals, and implements the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
