#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a class representing a tree structure where each vertex has a `children` list of its child vertices, a `good_components` attribute initialized to 0, and a `remaining_size` attribute initialized to the size of the subtree rooted at that vertex. s is an integer representing the starting vertex, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges.

Specifically, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1 if any descendant's `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, or by the `good_components` value of that descendant otherwise. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` holds the sum of `remaining_size` values of all descendants that meet the size constraint `x`. The `tree.vertices[v].children` list is empty for all vertices as all children have been processed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a tree structure to determine the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a specified vertex `s`. A good component is defined as a connected component with a `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`. The function updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex based on the sizes of its descendants. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the subtree rooted at vertex `s`.

    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `good_components` will be the total count of good components found across all subtrees, plus the number of subtrees where `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`. Similarly, `remaining_size` will be the sum of `remaining_size_subtree` values from all iterations, plus the number of subtrees where `remaining_size_subtree` was less than `x`. The exact numerical values depend on the specific results of `func_2` for each subtree.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree data structure), a vertex `v`, and an integer `x`. It recursively traverses the tree starting from vertex `v`, counts the number of good connected components (where the size of the component is at least `x` after removing some edges), and calculates the total size of the remaining parts of these components. The function returns two values: `good_components`, which represents the total count of such good components, and `remaining_size`, which represents the combined size of the remaining parts of these components.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices, an integer `k` representing a positive integer condition, and an integer `x` representing the size threshold for the connected components. It checks if the number of connected components in the tree with size greater than `x` is greater than `k`. If so, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns True if the number of such components equals `k` and the remaining size meets the threshold, or False if neither condition is met.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree with n vertices, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n, and the method func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, mid: int) returns a boolean indicating whether it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least mid.

    #State: Output State: The final values of `beg` and `end` will be such that `beg` is less than or equal to `end`, and `end` is the largest integer for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns false when `mid` is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true for some `mid`, then `beg` will be equal to that `mid`. Otherwise, `end` will be the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned false.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `beg` and `end` will converge to a point where further division does not satisfy the condition of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, or they will be equal if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true for every possible `mid` within the range.

    #The program returns the value of `beg`, which is the smallest integer such that `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns true, or the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned false if no such `mid` exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree instance (`tree`), an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to remove. It returns the smallest integer `beg` such that removing exactly `k` edges can result in connected components with sizes at least `beg`, or the last value for which removing `k` edges cannot achieve this if no such `beg` exists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and tree is an instance of a custom Tree class that represents the tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree.

    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains unchanged, `[u, v]` contains the integers `u-1` and `v-1` which were provided as input during the last iteration, and the tree now includes all the edges specified by the inputs. The loop has executed `n-1` times, adding each of the `n-1` edges of the tree as per the given inputs.

    #This is printed: func_4(tree, n, k) (where `tree` is the tree structure with `n` vertices, `n` is the number of vertices, and `k` is an unchanged parameter)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices in the tree; `k`, the number of edges to be removed; and `tree`, an instance of a custom Tree class representing the tree structure. It constructs the tree by adding edges based on user input, roots the tree non-recursively, and then calls another function `func_4` to process the tree with `n` and `k`. The function ultimately returns the result of `func_4`, which is dependent on the operations performed on the tree.
