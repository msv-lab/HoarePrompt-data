State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be at least 1, `i` must be 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- For the loop to execute, the condition `t` (which is the upper limit of the range) must be at least 1.
- The initial value of `i` should be set to 0 so that the loop can start from the first iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1 and `i` is 0.
