Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`.
- `n` is the first integer input split from input.
- `k` is the second integer input split from input.
- The current value of `n` is less than `k`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This code simply prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. Since the string to be printed is explicitly given in the code, it does not depend on the values of any variables.

Output: **'NO'**
