Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases (t) where for each case, it takes integers n and k as inputs. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, it processes these values but does not specify the exact return type or values.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases, and for each case, it processes two large integers `n` and `k`. However, without specific details on the operations or return values, the description focuses on the implied input parameters and their constraints.
