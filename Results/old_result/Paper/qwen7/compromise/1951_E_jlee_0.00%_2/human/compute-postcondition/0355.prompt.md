Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `count2` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `count` is 0, `j` is 1, and the first element of `s` is now the first character of `string`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `done` is True, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `j` is 1, the first element of `s` is now the first character of `string`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is either 0 or equal to `count`, `s[j]` is equal to `x` if `count2` is equal to `count`, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `done` is True, `count` is `j`, and `count2` is either 0, `j + 1`, or does not exceed `count`. If `count2` equals `count`, `count` remains `j`; if `count2` is 0, `count` is reset to `j` and `count2` becomes 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is either 0 or `j + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `done` is True, `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is between `0` and `count` (exclusive) and `count` is not greater than `1`, we continue the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the if condition is false, `count2` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
