Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- `i` is `1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string
- `n` is `1`
- `x` is the first character of the input string
- `count` is `1`
- `count2` is either `0` or `1`
- `j` is `1`
- The first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print('YES')`.

The `print('YES')` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any of the other variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
