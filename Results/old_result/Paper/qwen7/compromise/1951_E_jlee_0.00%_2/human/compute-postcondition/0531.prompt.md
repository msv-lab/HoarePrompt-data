Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `done` is True, `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`, `count2` is either 0, `j + 1`, or does not exceed `count`, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `j` is the final value it reaches during the last iteration of the loop, and the loop has completed all its iterations without breaking out of the loop prematurely.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is the final value it reached during the last iteration of the loop, `n` remains the same, `done` is True, `count` remains the same, and `count2` either remains the same or is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count` reaches 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
