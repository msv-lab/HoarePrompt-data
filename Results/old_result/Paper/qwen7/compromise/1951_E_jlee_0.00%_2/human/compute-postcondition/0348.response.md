Postcondition: `done` is True, `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, the most internal loop or if statement continues unless `count` is greater than 1, in which case we break out of it. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
