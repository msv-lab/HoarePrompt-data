Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` and `n` are integers, `done` is True, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the `done` variable remains True but no specific action is mentioned within the if part.
