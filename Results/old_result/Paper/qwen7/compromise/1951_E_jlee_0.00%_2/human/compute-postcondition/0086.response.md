Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string.
- `n` is 1.
- `done` is True.
- `x` is the first character of the input string.
- `count` is 0.
- `count2` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is greater than `count`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables since the print statement is not dependent on any of these variables.

Output: **YES**
