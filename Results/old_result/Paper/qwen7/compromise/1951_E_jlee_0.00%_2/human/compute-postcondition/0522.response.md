Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` remains the same, `done` is True, and `count2` either remains the same or is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` or `count` reaches 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` equals `x` and `count2` is not greater than `count`, `count2` is incremented by 1.
