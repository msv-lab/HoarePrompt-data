Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` is still False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is 3, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list containing the characters of the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `j` is the final value it reached during the last iteration of the loop, and `t` must be greater than 2.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` and `n` are integers, `done` is True, and `count` is greater than or equal to 0. If `s[j] != x` and `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `count2` remains unchanged. If `s[j] != x` and `count2` equals `count`, then `count2` becomes 0 or remains unchanged. If `s[j] == x`, then `count2` is `count + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `done` is True, `count` is either `j` (if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count` reaches 1) or the same as the original `count` (if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`), and `count2` is either the same as the original `count2` (if `count2` is less than `count` and we continue the loop or break out of the loop or if statement when `count > 1`) or 0 (if `count2` is less than `count` and we break out of the loop or if statement when `count` reaches 1) or `count2 + 1` (if `s[j]` is equal to `x`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` remains the same, `done` is True, `count` remains the same, and `count2` either remains the same or is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count` reaches 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
