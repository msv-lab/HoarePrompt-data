Based on the initial state provided:

- `count2` is 0.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is a new input string.
- `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `done` is True.
- `x` is the first character of the new input string.
- The current value of `count` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- The first element of `s` is now the first character of `string`.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is less than `count`.
- `count2` is greater than `count`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the other variables because the print statement is explicitly printing the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
