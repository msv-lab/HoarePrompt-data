Output State: **`done` is True, `count` is `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `count2` was being evaluated. The values of `done` and `count` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
