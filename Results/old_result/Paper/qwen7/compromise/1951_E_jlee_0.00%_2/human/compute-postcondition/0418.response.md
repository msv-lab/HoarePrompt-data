Given the initial state:

- `s` is a string.
- `j` and `n` are integers.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- Either `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`.
- The value of `count2` is equal to `count`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `string[:j - 1]`:**
   - This slice notation means we take the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
   - Since `j` is an integer, `j - 1` is also an integer representing the position in the string.

2. **Understanding `string[j - 1:]`:**
   - This slice notation means we take the substring starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.
   - Again, since `j` is an integer, `j - 1` is the starting index.

3. **Combining the slices:**
   - The `print` statement will concatenate these two substrings with a space in between.

Based on the given conditions, we don't have explicit values for `string` or `j`, but we know the indices and slices are valid based on the constraints provided.

Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`, followed by a space, and then the substring starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

Output: **string[:j - 1] string[j - 1:]**
