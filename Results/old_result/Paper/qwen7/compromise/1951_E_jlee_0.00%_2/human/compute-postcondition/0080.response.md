Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`, and we continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop or continues the current one. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
