Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, and the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j`.
