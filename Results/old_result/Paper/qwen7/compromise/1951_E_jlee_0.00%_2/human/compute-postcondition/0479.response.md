Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `done` is True, `count` is either `j` (if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count` reaches 1) or the same as the original `count` (if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`), and `count2` is either the same as the original `count2` (if `count2` is less than `count` and we continue the loop or break out of the loop or if statement) or 0 (if `count2` equals `count` and we break out of the loop or if statement when `count` reaches 1).
