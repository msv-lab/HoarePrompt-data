Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` and `n` are integers, `done` is True, and `count` is `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then no specific action is taken within the if part, and `done` remains True. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
