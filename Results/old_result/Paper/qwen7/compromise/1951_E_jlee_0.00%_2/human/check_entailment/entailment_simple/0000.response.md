Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.
2. **Single Character String Check**: The program correctly identifies if the string `s` is a single character and prints "NO" in such cases.
3. **Non-Palindrome Check**: The program checks if the first character `x` is different from the last character of the string. If they are different, it prints "YES" and the entire string as the partition.
4. **Uniform Character Check**: The program checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it prints "NO".
5. **Specific Non-Palindrome Conditions**: The program checks specific conditions where the string can be split into two non-palindromic parts:
   - If the string length is odd and the middle character is different from `x`.
   - If the string can be split such that the first part does not contain `x` and the second part starts with `x`.
6. **General Non-Palindrome Check**: The program iterates through the string to find a point where the characters do not match, indicating a potential partition. If such a point is found, it prints "YES" and the appropriate partition.
7. **Final Check**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NO".

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program logic appears to cover all necessary cases and produce the correct output based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
