Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly categorizes the constraints into three lists: `big` (for constraints of type 1), `less` (for constraints of type 2), and `no` (for constraints of type 3).
2. It calculates the potential range of valid `k` values as the difference between the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`.
3. It then adjusts this range by subtracting one for each element in `no` that falls within the calculated range.
4. The logic handles the special case where the adjusted range is less than 1 by printing 0.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the solution. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
