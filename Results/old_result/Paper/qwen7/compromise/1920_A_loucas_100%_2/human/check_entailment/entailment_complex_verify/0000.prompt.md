You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: All elements from `no` have been iterated over, and for each iteration, the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` was satisfied, leading to `num` being decremented by 1 for each such element. Therefore, `num` is now equal to zero since all elements in `no` that met the condition have been processed. The variables `innerLoop` is now 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1` (which is -1), `big` contains all integers `a` for which `x` was 1 during the iterations, `less` contains all integers `a` for which `x` was 2 during the iterations, and `no` is empty as all its elements have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t and an integer n. For each test case, it reads n lines of input, where each line contains two integers a and x. Based on the value of x, it categorizes a into three lists: `big`, `less`, and `no`. After processing all inputs, it calculates the difference between the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, adjusting this difference by subtracting one for each element in `no` that falls within the range defined by `min(less)` and `max(big)`. If the resulting value is less than 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the adjusted difference.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the `no` list (which contains values that `k` must not be equal to) overlaps with the range defined by the `big` and `less` lists. Specifically, if there is a value in `no` that lies between the minimum of `less` and the maximum of `big`, the program will incorrectly count it as a valid value for `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
According to the problem description, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 10, and `k` must not be equal to 1 or 5. The program correctly identifies that the possible values for `k` are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, resulting in 7 valid values.

However, the program does not handle the case where `k` cannot be 1 or 5, which are both within the range [3, 10]. The program calculates the range correctly as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, which is `3 - 5 + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1`, but it should be `10 - 3 + 1 = 8`. After adjusting for the values in `no`, it should subtract 2 (for 1 and 5), resulting in `8 - 2 = 6`.

The program fails to account for these overlapping values in the `no` list, leading to an incorrect count. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
