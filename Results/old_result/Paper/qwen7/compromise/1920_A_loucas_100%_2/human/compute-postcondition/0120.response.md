Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `no` list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to the next integer in the `no` list, and it either met the condition (being within the range defined by `less` and `big`) or remained unchanged.

3. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `i` is now the next integer in the `no` list, we need to ensure that `no` still contains at least one integer.
   - We also need to ensure that `i` meets the condition specified in the postcondition: either it is within the range defined by the minimum value in the `less` list and the maximum value in the `big` list, or it remains unchanged from its original value in the `no` list.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `no` still contains at least one integer, and `i` is the next integer in the `no` list, meeting the specified condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`no` contains at least one integer, `i` is the next integer in the `no` list, and either `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, or `i` remains unchanged from its original value in the `no` list.**
