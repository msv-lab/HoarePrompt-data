Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer.**

The code assigns the value of the input to the variable `innerLoop`. Since the input is taken from the user, the exact value of `innerLoop` is not known, but it is stored in `innerLoop`. All other variables remain unchanged.
