Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for i in no:`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `i` and `no`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on values from the list `no`.
   - `no`: This is a list that contains integers based on user inputs where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.

3. **Conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `no` must contain at least one element. If `no` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will take on values from `no`, we need to ensure that `no` is not empty.
   - The state of `i` itself does not need to be adjusted because it will be assigned values from `no` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `no`, ensuring it contains at least one integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`no` must contain at least one integer**
