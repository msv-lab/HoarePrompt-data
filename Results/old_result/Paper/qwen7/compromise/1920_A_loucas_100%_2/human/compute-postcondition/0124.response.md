Output State: `no` contains no integers, `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged, and `num` is decremented by the number of times an element in `no` satisfied the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `no` will be empty because each iteration removes an element from `no` if it satisfies the given condition. The lists `big` and `less` remain unchanged as the loop does not modify them. The variable `num` is decremented by the count of elements in `no` that met the specified condition during each iteration of the loop.
