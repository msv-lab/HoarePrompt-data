Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on processing a series of constraints. Each test case involves an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). It then processes n lines of input, each containing two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), ensuring there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and all constraints are unique.**
