Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 <= min_less` and `i + 1` < max_big, `no` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The variable `num` is decremented by 1. Since the initial condition was `i + 1 <= min_less` and `i + 2 < max_big`, after decrementing `num` (which is not directly related to `i`), the conditions for `i` remain the same, except that the first condition changes to `i + 1 <= min_less`. The variable `no` remains unchanged.
