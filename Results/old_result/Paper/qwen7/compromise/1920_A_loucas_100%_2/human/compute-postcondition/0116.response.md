Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in no`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is based on the value of `i`. Specifically, the postcondition given is:
   - `no` contains at least one integer.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, then the current minimum value in the `less` list is greater than or equal to `i`, and the current maximum value in the `big` list is less than or equal to `i`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `no`, the value of `i` will change with each iteration.
   - The other variables (`no`, `less`, and `big`) remain unchanged within the loop.

4. **Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the `no` list.
   - The postcondition ensures that `i` must satisfy the condition relative to the `less` and `big` lists. However, since the loop is simply iterating over `no`, the values of `less` and `big` do not change and remain as they were at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i` to the next element in the `no` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`no` contains at least one integer, `i` is the next integer in the `no` list, `less` and `big` lists remain as they were at the start of the loop**.
