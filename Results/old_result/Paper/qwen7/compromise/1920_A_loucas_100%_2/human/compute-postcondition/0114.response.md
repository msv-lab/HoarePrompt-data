Postcondition: `no` contains at least one integer. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, then the current minimum value in the `less` list is greater than or equal to `i`, and the current maximum value in the `big` list is less than or equal to `i`. Otherwise, the condition does not change.
