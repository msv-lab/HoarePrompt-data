Output State: `no` contains no integers, `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged, and `num` is decremented by the number of times an element in `no` satisfied the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.

Explanation: Since the loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the `no` list, and given that each iteration checks if the current element `i` satisfies the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`, and upon satisfying the condition, `num` is decremented by 1, after all iterations, `no` will be empty (since all elements that satisfy the condition are removed). The lists `big` and `less` remain unchanged because the loop does not modify them. `num` is decremented by the count of elements in `no` that satisfied the condition.
