The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the formula involving \( a \) and \( b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are derived from \( n \) and \( m \). Specifically, it computes the sum of certain terms \( x \) for each \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( b \), where \( x \) is determined by the condition \( a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0 \). Finally, it prints the computed sum minus one for each test case.
