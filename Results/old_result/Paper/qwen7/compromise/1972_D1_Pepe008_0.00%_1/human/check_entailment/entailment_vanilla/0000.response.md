Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - `T` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `a` and `b` are read from the input.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over all possible values of `i` from `1` to `b`.
   - For each value of `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than `0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Problem Description Recap

We need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issues in the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Formula:**
   - The formula used in the program, `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This formula seems to be an attempt to count something related to the problem but is not directly derived from the problem statement.

2. **Range of `i`:**
   - The program iterates over `i` from `1` to `b`. However, this range might not cover all necessary values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the condition.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The condition should check if \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). The current logic does not perform this check.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition directly.

### Corrected Program

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, a + 1):
            for j in range(1, b + 1):
                if (i + j) % (j * gcd(i, j)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It uses an incorrect formula and does not properly check the required condition.

**Correctness: False**
