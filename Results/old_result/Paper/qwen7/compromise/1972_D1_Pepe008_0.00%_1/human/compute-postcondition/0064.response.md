Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `b` must be at least 2.
   - `x` is 3.
   - `a` minus `i` times `(i - 1)` is greater than 0.
   - `suma` is 4.
   - `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `b + 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `b + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `b` is at least 3 (since `b` must be at least 2 and `i` will increment to 3).

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `b` must still be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.

6. **Verify other states**:
   - `x` remains 3.
   - `suma` remains 4.
   - `a` minus `i` times `(i - 1)` being greater than 0 is not directly relevant to the loop continuation but should hold true for the next iteration.
   - The relationship between `x` and `a`, `i`, and `suma` should still hold.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `b`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `b` must be at least 3, `x` is 3, `suma` is 4**
