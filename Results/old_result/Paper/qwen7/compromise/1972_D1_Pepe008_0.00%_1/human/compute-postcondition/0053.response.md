Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` must be a positive integer, `x` is 2**

Explanation: The initial value of `i` is 1. The code calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Substituting `i = 1` into the formula, we get:

- `i * (i - 1)` becomes `1 * (1 - 1)`, which is `0`.
- The formula simplifies to `(a - 0) // 1 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `a // 1 + 1`.
- Since `a // 1` is simply `a` and adding `1` gives us `a + 1`.

Given that `a` is not specified, but the formula simplifies to `a + 1` and since `a` is implied to be an integer, the simplest and most direct value for `x` when `i = 1` is `1 + 1`, which equals `2`. Therefore, `x` is assigned the value `2`. The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged.
