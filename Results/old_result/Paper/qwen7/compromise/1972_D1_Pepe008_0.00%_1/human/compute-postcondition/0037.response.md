Output State: **`suma` is `suma + (a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**

Explanation: The variable `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. This value is then added to `suma`, which means `suma` now holds the sum of its previous value and the newly computed `x`. The initial state of `x` and the calculation used to determine its value are preserved, and the updated value of `suma` reflects the addition of `x`.
