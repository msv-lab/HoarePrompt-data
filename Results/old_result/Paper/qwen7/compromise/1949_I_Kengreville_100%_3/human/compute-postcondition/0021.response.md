Functionality: **The function processes a set of points (x, y) and their respective radii (r) to determine if a certain condition can be satisfied across all points. It initializes several lists and performs depth-first searches (DFS) to mark visited points and calculate coefficients. If any DFS results in a bipartite graph configuration where the total coefficient is non-zero, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function modifies the global lists visited and coef based on the DFS outcomes.**
