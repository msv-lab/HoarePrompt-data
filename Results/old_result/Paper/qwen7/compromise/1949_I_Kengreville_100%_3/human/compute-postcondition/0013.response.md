Output State: `bipartite` is True/False based on the result of all `dfs` calls, `n` is the same input integer, `x` is the same list of length `n`, `y` is the same list of length `n`, `r` is the same list of length `n`, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` with some elements possibly changed to True, `coef` is a list of length `n` with some elements possibly set to 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True if any `dfs` call results in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not equal to 0 for that call, otherwise `ok` is False.
