### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- **Explanation:** The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair during the excursions.

The original assessment is correct because the program indeed does not account for the probability of choosing each pair. Instead, it assumes that each pair is chosen with equal probability, which is not true. The expected value should be calculated considering the actual probability of each pair being chosen.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for all pairs of friends.
   - This formula assumes that each pair is chosen exactly `k * (k + 1) // 2` times, which is incorrect. The actual number of times a pair is chosen follows a binomial distribution, and the expected value must be calculated accordingly.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input reading and calling of `func_1` are correct, but the logic inside `func_1` is flawed.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends `(a, b)` with friendship value `f`, the expected number of times they are chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1))`.
   - Therefore, the expected contribution of each pair `(a, b)` to the sum is `f * (k / (n * (n - 1)))`.
   - The sum of these expected contributions for all pairs of friends gives the correct expected value.

4. **Current Implementation:**
   - The current implementation in `func_1` simply sums up `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for all pairs, which is incorrect because it does not account for the actual probability of choosing each pair.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value due to the incorrect assumption about the probability of choosing each pair. Therefore, we should not maintain the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
