### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Input Parameters**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
2. **Initialization**: `result` is initialized to 0.
3. **Loop Over Pairs**: For each pair of friends, the program adds the product of the friendship value (`f`) and the combination formula \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) to `result`.
4. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is returned modulo \( MOD \).

The combination formula \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) represents the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of \( k \) excursions. This part of the code correctly accounts for the number of times a pair can be chosen.

However, the issue lies in the fact that the program does not consider the probability of choosing each pair. The problem statement specifies that the teacher chooses pairs randomly and independently, implying that each pair has an equal chance of being selected. But the program simply sums up the friendship values multiplied by the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of \( k \) without considering the probability of selection.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parameters**: `t` (number of test cases).
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
3. **Function Call**: It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

#### Correctness of the Program:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not account for the probability of selecting each pair. Instead, it assumes that each pair is chosen with equal frequency, which is not true. The expected value calculation should take into account the probability of selecting each pair, which is not correctly implemented in the `func_1` function.

The correct approach would involve calculating the probability of selecting each pair and using these probabilities to compute the expected value. The current implementation only considers the friendship values without accounting for the selection probabilities.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of selecting each pair, which is essential for calculating the expected value accurately.
