Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. `n` is the number of children, `m` is the number of pairs of friends, `k` is the number of excursions, and `friendships` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively. The function returns the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for all pairs of friends.**

This means the function calculates the sum of the product of the friendship value `f` and a combinatorial term `(k * (k + 1) // 2)` modulo `MOD` for every pair of friends listed in the `friendships` list.
