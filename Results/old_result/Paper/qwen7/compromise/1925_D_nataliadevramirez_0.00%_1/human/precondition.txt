n is a positive integer representing the number of children, m is a non-negative integer representing the number of pairs of friends, and k is a positive integer representing the number of excursions. friendships is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value, respectively. Additionally, a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
