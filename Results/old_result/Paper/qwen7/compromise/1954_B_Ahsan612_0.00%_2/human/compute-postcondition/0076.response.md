Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `num` is now `ar[i]`, `i` is either 6 or 7, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is explicitly assigned the value `1`. Since `minn` was previously defined as `2` or `same`, and `same` is now `1`, `minn` also becomes `1`. The other variables (`num`, `i`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
