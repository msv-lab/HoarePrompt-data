Postcondition: **`same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the most frequent element in the list `ar`, `num` is the last element that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `minn` and `same`, and `minn` equals infinity**.
