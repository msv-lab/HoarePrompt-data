Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the entire list `ar`. `same` will be 1 because the loop has finished, meaning no new consecutive sequence is being counted. `num` will be the last element of the list `ar` that was processed. `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`. `t` will be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` will be the last input integer, and `minn` will be the smallest value among all the counts of consecutive occurrences of any number in all lists `ar` across all test cases.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after all test cases have been processed by the loop. The variable `minn` captures the essence of the problem by storing the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of any number across all arrays `ar` for all test cases, ensuring that the solution meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.
