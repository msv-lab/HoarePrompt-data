Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 1), `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 2, and `minn` remains the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 1).**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 2 based on the condition that if `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `i` is 1, otherwise `i` is 2. Since `i` was already 2, incrementing it by 1 makes `i` equal to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
