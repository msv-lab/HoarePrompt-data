Output State: `same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i]` before the loop ended, `i` is `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `same` will hold the count of the most consecutive occurrences of any single element in the array `ar`. The variable `num` will be the element that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences. The variable `i` will be set to the length of the array `ar`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements. The variable `minn` will contain the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, which represents the smallest count of consecutive occurrences for any element.
