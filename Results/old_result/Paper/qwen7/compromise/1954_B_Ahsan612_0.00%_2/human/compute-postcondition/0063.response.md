The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be incremented to a value that satisfies the condition `i < len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is currently 3, the smallest possible value for `i` to satisfy the condition is 4 (assuming `len(ar)` is at least 4). Since no other states directly affect the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the modified state:

State: **`same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`**
