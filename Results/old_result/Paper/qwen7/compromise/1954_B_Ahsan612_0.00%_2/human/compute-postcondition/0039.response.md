Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` is set to infinity.
- `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively.
- `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `minn` is updated to be the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.

The print statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `-1` without referencing any of the other variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **-1**
