Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[3]`, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 1, `ar` is a list of integers, and the first element of `ar` is not equal to `num`**.

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`infinity`) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Since 1 is less than infinity, `minn` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
