Output State: **`same` is either 4 or 2, `num` is either `ar[0]` when `same` is 4 or `ar[i]` when `same` is 2, `i` is either 5 or 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 2, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 6.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Since `same` was either 3 or 1, it now becomes either 4 (if it was 3) or 2 (if it was 1). The values of `num`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `minn`, and `len(ar)` remain unchanged.
