Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1); `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `same` is 1; `num` is equal to `ar[2]`; `i` is 2; `same` is 1.**

The code `same = 1` simply reassigns the value of `same` to 1, which does not change any other variables or conditions. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
