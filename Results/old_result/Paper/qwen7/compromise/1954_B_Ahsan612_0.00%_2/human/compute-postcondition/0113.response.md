Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 2, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is reassigned to 1, changing its value from 2 to 1. The other variables (`minn`, `num`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `ar`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
