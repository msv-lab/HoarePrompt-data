Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1); `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `same` is 1; `num` is equal to `ar[2]`; `i` is 2; `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (infinity) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Since 1 is less than infinity, `minn` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
