Output State: **`same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended, `i` is `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and `same`. Since `same` is the count of the most consecutive occurrences of any single element in the array `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, this line ensures that `minn` holds the smallest count of consecutive occurrences for any element. The other variables remain unchanged.
