Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 3, `i` is increased by 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and `same`. Since `same` is either 3 or 1, `minn` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and either 3 or 1. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `num` is updated to be the new value of `ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
