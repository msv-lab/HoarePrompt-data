Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

The code simply reassigns the value of `same` to 1, which does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `minn`, `num`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `ar[i]` remain unchanged.
