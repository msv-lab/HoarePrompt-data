Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[3]`, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 1, `ar` is a list of integers, and the first element of `ar` is not equal to `num`.**

The code simply reassigns the value of `same` to 1, which does not change any other variables or affect their states. Therefore, all other variables remain in their initial states as described in the initial state.
