Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `num` is now `ar[i]`, `i` is either 6 or 7, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 2, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 6.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be the value of `ar[i]`. Since `i` is either 6 or 7, `num` will take the value of `ar[6]` or `ar[7]` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
