Output State: **`same` is either 4 or 2; `num` is either `ar[0]` when `same` is 4 or `ar[i]` when `same` is 2; `i` is either 6 or 7; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `minn` is 2; `len(ar)` must be greater than 6.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `i` was either 5 or 6, after incrementing, `i` becomes either 6 or 7. The other variables remain unchanged because the condition `ar[i] == num` was not specified to change them. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `i` and maintains the other variables in their initial conditions unless there's a specific change due to the condition, which was not provided in this case.
