Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 2, `i` is less than `len(ar) - 1`, `num` is `ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. The values of `minn` and `same` remain unchanged, and the condition for `i` also remains valid. Therefore, `num` now holds the value of `ar[i]`.
