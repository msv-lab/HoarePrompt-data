Output State: **`same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended, `i` is `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, and `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, which is either equal to infinity (if it was not updated within the loop) or a finite value (if it was updated).**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
