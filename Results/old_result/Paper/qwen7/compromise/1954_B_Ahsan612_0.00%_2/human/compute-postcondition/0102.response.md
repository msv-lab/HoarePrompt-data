Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers, and the first element of `ar` is not equal to `num`**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
