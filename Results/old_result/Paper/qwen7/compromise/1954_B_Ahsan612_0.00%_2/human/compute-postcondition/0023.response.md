Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is `ar[4]`, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code `same = 1` simply reassigns the value of `same` to 1. Since `same` was already 1 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
