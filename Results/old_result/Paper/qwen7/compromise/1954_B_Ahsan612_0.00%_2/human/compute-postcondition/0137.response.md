Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `ar`. It determines the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` across all test cases. If no such occurrence exists, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the minimum count. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
