Postcondition: `same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` becomes 2, `num` remains `ar[0]`, `i` becomes 2, and other variables retain their values. Otherwise, `same` remains 1, `minn` becomes 1, `num` becomes `ar[i]`, `i` becomes 3, and other variables retain their values.
