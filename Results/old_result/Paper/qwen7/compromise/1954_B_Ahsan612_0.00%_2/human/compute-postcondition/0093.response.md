Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended, `i` is `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, and we take input for the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `same` is now explicitly set to 1, while the other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
