Output State: **`same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `i` must be less than `len(ar)` still holds, and the current value of `ar[i]` remains equal to `num`.
