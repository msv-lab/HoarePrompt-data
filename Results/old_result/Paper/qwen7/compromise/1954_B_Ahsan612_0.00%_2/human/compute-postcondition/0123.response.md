Output State: **`same` is either 4 or 2; `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 3; `i` is increased by 1; `num` is `ar[i]`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Since the condition for changing the value of `same` and `minn` depends on whether `ar[i] == num`, and this condition is not met (as the code only increments `i` without checking the condition), the values of `same` and `minn` remain as they were initially described.
