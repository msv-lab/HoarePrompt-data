Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` is a list where each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` is set to `i - 1`, `start_index` is an integer, `i` is `i - 1`, and `res` is a list containing the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`**.

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with the argument `i - 1`. This function presumably modifies the list `arr` such that each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` is set to `i - 1`. It also updates the variable `res` to contain the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`. Since the function call does not directly assign new values to `is_already_stairs`, `start_index`, or `i`, these variables retain their previous values. The range of elements modified in `arr` is now from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` instead of `start_index` to `start_index + i`.
