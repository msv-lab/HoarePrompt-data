You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, and res is an initially empty list that will store the operations performed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: Output State: `is_already_stairs` is False.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop sets `is_already_stairs` to `False` if any element in the specified range of `arr` does not match its index. Since the loop will check every element in the range `start_index` to `start_index + i`, if even one element does not match its index, `is_already_stairs` will be set to `False`. Given that the initial state of `is_already_stairs` is `True`, it will only remain `True` if all elements in the specified range match their indices. Otherwise, it will be set to `False` after the first mismatch.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: Output State: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` is a list where each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` is set to `i`, `start_index` is an integer, `i` is `i - 1`, and `res` is a list containing the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` is a list of integers. If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, then `i` is set to `i - 1`. Otherwise, each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` in `arr` is set to `i - 1`, `i` is set to `i - 1`, and `res` is a list containing the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter i, which is an index of a list arr. There is no return statement in the function, so it does not return any value. If the function has a return statement, it returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
