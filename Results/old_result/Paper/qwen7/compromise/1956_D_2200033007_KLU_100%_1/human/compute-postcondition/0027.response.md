Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` is a list of integers. If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, then `i` is set to `i - 1`. Otherwise, each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` in `arr` is set to `i - 1`, `i` is set to `i - 1`, and `res` is a list containing the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`.
