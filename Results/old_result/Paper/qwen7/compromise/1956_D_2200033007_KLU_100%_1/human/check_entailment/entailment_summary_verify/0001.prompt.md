You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `make_stairs` processes a list `arr` starting from index `start_index` and modifies it based on the value of `i`. It checks if the elements in the specified range match their indices. If they do, it sets the first element to 1 and returns. If not, it recursively adjusts the elements in the range to match their indices and records the changes in the list `res`. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations where we can choose a subarray and set all elements in that subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
   - We can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Functions Provided**:
   - `func_1(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> int`: This function seems to be intended to calculate the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`. However, the logic within this function is complex and recursive, and it does not directly solve the problem as stated.
   - `func_2(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]`: This function is supposed to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. However, it also uses recursion and does not seem to correctly implement the logic for finding the optimal operations.
   - `make_stairs(i: int) -> None`: This function is intended to create a "staircase" pattern in the array, but it is called recursively without proper context and does not seem to be used correctly.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Incorrect Approach**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They do not directly address the MEX value calculation and the operations needed to maximize the sum.
   - **Recursive Overhead**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` use recursion, which is inefficient and may lead to stack overflow for large inputs.
   - **Lack of Clear Logic**: The logic within these functions is unclear and does not align with the problem statement. For example, `func_1` attempts to calculate the maximum sum using a divide-and-conquer approach, but it does not consider the MEX value properly.
   - **Missing Implementation**: The `make_stairs` function is not used correctly and does not contribute to solving the problem as intended.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
