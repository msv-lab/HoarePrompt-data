### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations that update a subarray to the MEX (minimum excludant) of that subarray. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function appears to be a recursive function that computes some kind of maximum value using a divide-and-conquer approach. However, it does not involve the MEX operation or updating the array elements. Instead, it seems to be calculating some form of subarray sum or maximum value, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function also uses the results from `func_1` but does not implement the MEX operation. It attempts to find the maximum possible sum of the subarray, but it does not update the array elements to reflect the MEX operation. The function `func_2` returns a list of operations, but these operations are not based on the MEX operation.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**: This function is supposed to create a "staircase" pattern in the array, but it does not use the MEX operation either. It simply sets elements to specific values without considering the MEX operation.

Given that the provided functions do not implement the required MEX operation and do not update the array elements as specified, the program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
