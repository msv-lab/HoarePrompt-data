Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` work as intended according to the problem statement. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations. Each operation involves setting a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded) value of that subarray.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the maximum possible sum of the array elements by considering all possible subarrays and their MEX values. It uses memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations. The logic seems sound as it considers all subarrays and their potential sums.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function finds the subarray that achieves the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`. It recursively breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. The logic also appears correct as it handles different cases where the maximum sum might come from different parts of the array.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**: This function ensures that the elements in the specified range match their indices, effectively setting them to the required MEX value. It correctly handles the base case and recursively adjusts the elements to form a "staircase" pattern. This is crucial for achieving the maximum sum because it ensures that the smallest unused number is used to fill the subarray.

Given the detailed execution summaries and the logical structure of the functions, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as stated. The functions handle all necessary cases and ensure that the maximum sum is achieved with the correct sequence of operations.

Correctness: **True**
