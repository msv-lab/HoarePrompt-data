Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place. A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the parent node is less than or equal to (in a min heap) its child nodes. This transformation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `k`, but it changes the structure of `pq` to meet the heap property.
