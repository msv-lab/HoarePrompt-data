Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by pairs of integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a list of n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). For each test case, the function returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of specific parameters and a list of integers. The function processes these inputs and returns relevant information for each test case.
