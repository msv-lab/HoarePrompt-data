Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts. It incorrectly calculates the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's without considering the cyclic nature of the shifts.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    zero_count = s.count('0')
    one_count = n - zero_count
    cost = 0
    
    # Find the position where we should start shifting
    i = 0
    while i < n and s[i] == '1':
        i += 1
    
    # Calculate the cost of shifting
    cost += i + 1  # First shift to bring the first '0' to the front
    i = n - 1
    while i >= 0 and s[i] == '0':
        i -= 1
    
    # Remaining shifts to sort the rest of the string
    cost += n - i
    
    return cost

```

This corrected program finds the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the binary string. It counts the number of '0's and '1's and then determines the minimum cost by finding the best starting point for the shifts.
