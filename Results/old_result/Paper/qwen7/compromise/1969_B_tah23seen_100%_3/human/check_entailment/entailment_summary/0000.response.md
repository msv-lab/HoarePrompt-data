Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. It iterates through the string and calculates the cost based on the presence of '0's and preceding '1's.
3. The function `func_1` accurately computes the total cost according to the rules specified:
   - For each '0', if there are any '1's before it, the cost is incremented by the count of those '1's plus one.
4. The main part of the program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and printing the result.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
