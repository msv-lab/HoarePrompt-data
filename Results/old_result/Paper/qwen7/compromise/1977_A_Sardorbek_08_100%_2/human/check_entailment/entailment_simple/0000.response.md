Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `a` times.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, representing `n` and `m` respectively.
4. The logic inside the loop checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves:
   - If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes), it prints "YES".
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than moves allow.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints "Yes". This condition is incorrect because it should check if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even, which would mean an even number of additions and subtractions to balance out.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

The current logic incorrectly handles the parity check and the overall logic for determining if it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the correct approach should involve checking if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even, since each move changes the count by 1 (either +1 or -1).

Correctness: **False**
