Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - **Condition 2:** If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This is incorrect because it's possible to end up with more cubes than moves if there are enough moves to both add and remove cubes appropriately. For example, `b = 3` and `c = 4` is possible by adding 2 cubes and removing 1 cube.
   - **Condition 3:** If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This condition is correct because the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes. If they don't match, it's impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - **Condition 4:** Otherwise, it prints 'No'. This is a fallback condition but should not be necessary if the previous conditions cover all possibilities correctly.

### Correctness Check:

- **Condition 1:** Correct.
- **Condition 2:** Incorrect.
- **Condition 3:** Correct.
- **Condition 4:** Unnecessary and redundant.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and logical conditions. Specifically, the second condition is incorrect, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
