State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
2. The loop runs for `a` iterations.
3. For the loop to execute, `a` must be at least 1 (since `range(a)` includes 0 up to `a-1`).
4. The initial value of `t` (which is a positive integer between 1 and 100) does not affect whether the loop executes or not.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` to ensure it is at least 1, and `i` to its initial value of 0.
