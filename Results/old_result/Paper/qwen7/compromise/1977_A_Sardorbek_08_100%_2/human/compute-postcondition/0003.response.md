Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). It does not return a specific value but processes these inputs according to certain conditions or operations defined within the function body.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases, each containing values for t, n, and m, and performs some operation or checks based on these values. However, without the specific details of what the function does with these values, the exact functionality cannot be precisely stated beyond the processing of these parameters.
