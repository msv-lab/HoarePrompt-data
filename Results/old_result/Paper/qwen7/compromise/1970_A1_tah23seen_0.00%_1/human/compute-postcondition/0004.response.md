Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `len(s)`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 because the loop starts from the beginning of the range.
   - `len(s)` should be the length of the string `s`, which is already given as `n`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 and `len(s)` is equal to `n`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `ans` is an empty string (no adjustment needed).
   - `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {0: 0} (no adjustment needed).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(s)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(s)` is `n`**
