Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. The function `func_1` computes the prefix balances and stores them in a dictionary `d`. The keys of the dictionary are indices from 0 to `n-1`, and the values are the prefix balances.
3. After removing the last entry (which corresponds to the entire string and has a balance of 0), the dictionary is sorted by its values (prefix balances). Ties are broken by the decreasing order of positions.
4. The function constructs the output string `ans` by appending characters from the original string `s` in the order specified by the sorted dictionary `d`.
5. The final output string `ans` is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` matches the definition of the balanced shuffle operation. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
