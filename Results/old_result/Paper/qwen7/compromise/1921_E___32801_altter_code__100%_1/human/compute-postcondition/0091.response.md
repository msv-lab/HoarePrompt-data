Let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **`t`**: This is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Since `y1` is either 1 or the second element of `r`, and `y2` is the sixth element of `r` decreased by `a` or the sixth element of `r` plus `a`, `t` will be the absolute difference between these two values.

2. **`r`**: This is a list of six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as a delimiter. The elements are labeled as `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

3. **`n`**: The first element of `r`.

4. **`m`**: The second element of `r`.

5. **`x1`**: The third element of `r` increased by `a`.

6. **`y1`**: Either 1 or the second element of `r`.

7. **`x2`**: The fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`.

8. **`y2`**: The sixth element of `r` decreased by `a` or the sixth element of `r` plus `a`.

9. **`b`**: Defined as `x2 - x1`, and it is given that `x2 > x1`.

10. **Conditions**:
    - `x1 ≥ 1`
    - `x2 ≤ n`
    - `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`
    - `(b // 2 ≤ a or abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c or y1 > m or x1 < 1 or x2 > n or y1 > y2)`
    
Given the conditions, let's focus on the `print('draw')` statement. The string `'draw'` is directly printed without any variables being interpolated into it.

Output: **draw**
