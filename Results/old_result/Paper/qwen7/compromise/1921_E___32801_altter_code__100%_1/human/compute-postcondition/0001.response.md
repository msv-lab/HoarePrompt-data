Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is the third element of r, y1 is the fourth element of r, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string into a list `r` using space as the delimiter. Then, it assigns the first six elements of the list `r` to the variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the assignment operation.
