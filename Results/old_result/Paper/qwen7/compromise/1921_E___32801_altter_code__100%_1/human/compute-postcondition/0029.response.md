Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is incremented by 1, `y1` is adjusted based on the relationship with `y2` (if `y2` > `y1`, `y1` becomes one more than the original value; otherwise, `y1` becomes one less than the original value), `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `a` is either `y2 - 1` if `y1` â‰¥ `y2` or `m - y2` if `y1` < `y2`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.**

Explanation: The code `t = abs(y2 - y1)` calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to `t`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
