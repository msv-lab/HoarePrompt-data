Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is incremented by `a`, `y1` is adjusted by adding `a` to its previous value, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` reduced by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y2` is now equal to `m`.**

This means that `y1` has been incremented by `a`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
