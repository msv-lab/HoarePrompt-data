Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State and Conditions:**
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter.
   - `n` is the first element of `r`.
   - `m` is the second element of `r`.
   - `x1` is incremented by `a`.
   - `y1` is adjusted based on the condition: if `y2 <= y1`, then `y1` is set to `0`; otherwise, `y1` is adjusted by adding `a` to its previous value.
   - `x2` is the fifth element of `r` reduced by `a`.
   - `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.
   - `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - `c` is `-1` if `y2 <= y1` and `m - y1` otherwise.
   - `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
   - `b // 2` is less than or equal to `a`.
   - `abs(x2 - c)` is less than `x1 + c`.
   - `y1` is either less than 1 or greater than `m`.
   - `x1` is greater than `n`.

2. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since the exact values of `y1`, `y2`, `x1`, `x2`, `a`, `m`, and other elements are not explicitly given, we need to focus on the `print('draw')` statement.
   - The string `'draw'` is directly printed without any variables or conditions affecting it.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print('draw')` statement will simply print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
