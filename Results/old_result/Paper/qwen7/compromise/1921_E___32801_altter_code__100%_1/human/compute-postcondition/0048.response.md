Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is incremented by `a`.
- `y1` is adjusted based on the condition (if `y2 <= y1`, then `y1` is set to `0`; otherwise, `y1` is adjusted by adding `a` to its previous value).
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r` reduced by `a`.
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.
- `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `c` is `-1` if `y2 <= y1` and `m - y1` otherwise.
- `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will simply print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
