### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input and Initial Checks**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - In `func_1()`, it reads the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips.
   - It checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints 'Draw' and returns, which is correct because if Bob is in a lower or equal row than Alice, Bob cannot win since Alice can always move down and avoid Bob's position until the end.

2. **Odd Difference in Rows**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, it means the difference in rows between Bob and Alice is odd.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can win by moving diagonally to Bob's position.
     - Otherwise, it calculates movements for Alice and Bob to see if Alice can force a win.
     - The logic here seems to handle the movement constraints and edge cases well.

3. **Even Difference in Rows**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, it means the difference in rows between Bob and Alice is even.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can win by moving up to Alice's position.
     - Otherwise, it calculates movements for Alice and Bob to see if Bob can force a win.
     - The logic here also handles the movement constraints and edge cases well.

4. **Edge Cases and Final Checks**:
   - The code handles edge cases where movements might go out of bounds.
   - It correctly identifies when Alice or Bob can force a win or when the game results in a draw.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic for determining the outcome of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
