Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting index of the loop).
   - `len(b)` is the length of the list `b`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute at least once if `len(b)` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `len(b)` should be checked to ensure it is greater than 0.

5. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `f`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(b)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(b)` must be greater than 0**
