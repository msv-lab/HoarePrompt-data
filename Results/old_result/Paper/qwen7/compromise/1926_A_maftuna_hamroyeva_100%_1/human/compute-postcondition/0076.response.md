Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in `a`, `l` is 2, `h` is 0 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 1, and `i` is `i + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. The values of `a`, `j`, `h`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
