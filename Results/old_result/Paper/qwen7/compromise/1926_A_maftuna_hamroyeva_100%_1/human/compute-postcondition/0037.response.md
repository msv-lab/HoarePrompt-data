Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the last character of `a`, `l` is 0, `h` is 1, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since `h` was initially 0, after executing this line, `h` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
