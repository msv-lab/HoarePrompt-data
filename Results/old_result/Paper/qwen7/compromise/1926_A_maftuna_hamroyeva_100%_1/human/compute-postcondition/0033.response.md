Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j` which is being iterated over the string `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `a`.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `j` is set to the last character of the string `a` initially.
   - For the loop to execute, the string `a` must contain at least one character. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is set to the last character of `a`, we don't need to adjust its value.
   - We need to ensure that `a` is not an empty string, so that the loop can start and iterate over its characters.
   - The variables `l`, `h`, and `i` (which is `i + 1`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's requirements.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must be a non-empty string.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the last character of `a`, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, and `i` is `i + 1`**
