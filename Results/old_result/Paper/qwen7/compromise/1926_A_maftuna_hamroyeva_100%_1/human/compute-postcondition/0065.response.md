Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is 'A', `l` is 1, `h` is 0, and the current value of `i` is `i + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`a`, `j`, `h`, and the current value of `i`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
