Postcondition: **`a` is an empty string, `j` is undefined (since `a` is empty), `l` is either greater than `h` or equal to `h` (the total number of 'A' characters in the original string `a` is either greater than or equal to the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`), `h` is equal to the total number of characters in `a` minus `l`, and `i` is `i + n`, where `n` is the length of the original string `a`.**
