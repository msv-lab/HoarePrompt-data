Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in the string `a`, `h` is 2**

Explanation: The initial state is that `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in the string `a`, and if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1, otherwise `h` is 1. The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since `h` was initially 1 (because `j` is not 'A'), after executing `h += 1`, the value of `h` becomes 2. The values of `a` and `j` remain unchanged.
