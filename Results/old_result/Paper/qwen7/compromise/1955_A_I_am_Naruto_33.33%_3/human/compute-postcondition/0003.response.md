Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). It does not return a specific value but rather processes each test case based on the given constraints.**
