Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than half the single price `a`. In such cases, it would be more advantageous to buy all yogurts individually at price `a` rather than using the promotion. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 4`, `a = 5`, and `b = 6`. According to the problem description, the minimum cost should be `4 * 5 = 20` burles, but the program calculates `6 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 12` burles, which is incorrect.
