Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over each test case and checking the conditions specified in the problem statement. However, there are several issues with the logic and calculations in the program:

1. **Odd Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the described scoring system (where the total score must always be even).

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is incorrect. The current formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` does not accurately represent the maximum number of draws. 

   - The correct approach should involve considering the possible outcomes of games between the three players. Each game can result in either a win/loss (2 points for one player) or a draw (1 point for each player).
   - The key is to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent with the given values.

3. **Handling Draw Scores**: The program does not properly account for the distribution of points among the players. Specifically, it does not ensure that the scores can be achieved through a valid combination of wins and draws.

Given these issues, the provided solution is incorrect. A correct solution would need to re-evaluate the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws and ensure that the scores are consistent with the described scoring system.

Correctness: **False**
