Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either '-1' or an integer result. The specific values depend on the input provided for each iteration of the loop. If the sum of the three integers in each input line is odd, the output will be '-1'. Otherwise, the output will be the calculated result based on the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
