#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: s is a list containing all the integer values of each character in sChar, and i is the last character in sChar.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is 11, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 11, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to increment `left` until it reaches the end of the string `s` or encounters a '1'. Given that `left` is 11 after the third iteration and the loop condition `left < len(s)` must hold, `left` will continue to increment until it reaches the length of `s`. This means `left` will be equal to the length of `s`, making `right` also equal to the length of `s` since the loop terminates when `left` equals `right`. 
    #
    #Since the loop increments `cost` by `right - left + 1` each time it swaps elements, and `right` is now equal to `len(s)`, the final value of `cost` will be `len(s) - 11 + 1 = len(s) - 10`. Given that `left` is 11, the length of `s` must be at least 11 for the loop to have completed its iterations. Therefore, `cost` will be `11` if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and it will increase accordingly if the length of `s` is greater than 11. The other variables remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration.
    return cost
    #The program returns a cost value which is 11 if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and increases by 1 for each additional character beyond 11 in the length of `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `sChar` and converts it into a list of integers. It then iterates through the list, swapping '1's and '0's to move all '0's to the left side and all '1's to the right side. The function calculates the total cost, which is the sum of the sizes of the subarrays that need to be swapped to achieve the desired order. The cost is determined by the number of characters in the string `sChar`. If the length of `sChar` is exactly 11, the function returns 11; otherwise, it returns 11 plus the number of additional characters beyond 11.
