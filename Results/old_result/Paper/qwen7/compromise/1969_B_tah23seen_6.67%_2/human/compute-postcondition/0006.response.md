Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 1, `s` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are the same as before and the third element is the next character in the new `sChar`, `i` is the next character in the new `sChar`.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(i)` appends the character `i` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains two elements, where the second element is the integer value of the second character of the original `sChar`. After appending `i`, `s` now contains three elements: the first two elements remain unchanged, and the third element is the character `i`. The variable `i` itself is updated to be the next character in the new `sChar`. The value of `sChar` and the initial state of `s` (with the second element being the integer value of the second character) are preserved.
