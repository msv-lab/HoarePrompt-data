Output State: **`left` is 4, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - left + 1`, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'**.

Explanation: The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `s`, `i`, `cost`, `right`, and the conditions about `s[1]` and characters from index `right` onwards remain unchanged.
