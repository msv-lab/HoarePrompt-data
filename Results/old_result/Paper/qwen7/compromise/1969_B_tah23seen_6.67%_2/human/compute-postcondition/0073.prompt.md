Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `left` is 11, `s[6]` is not '1', `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` is equal to `len(s)` and `s[right]` is '0'.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `right` as long as `s[right]` is not '0'. After the loop has executed all its iterations, `right` will be equal to the length of the string `s`, because the loop stops when it encounters the first '0' or reaches the end of the string. Given that the loop condition `s[right] != '0'` must hold until the last possible character (which would be '0'), `s[right]` must be '0' when the loop terminates. All other variables (`left`, `s[6]`, and `len(s)`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states since they are not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 7, `s[6]` is not '1', `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` is equal to `len(s)` and `s[right]` is '0'
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is 8, `s[7]` is not '1', `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` is equal to `len(s)` and `s[right]` is '0'
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is 9, `s[7]` is not '1', `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` is equal to `len(s)` and `s[right]` is '0'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
