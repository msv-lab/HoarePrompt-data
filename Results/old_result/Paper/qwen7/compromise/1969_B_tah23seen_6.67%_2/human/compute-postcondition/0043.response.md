Output State: **`left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - 4`, `right` is incremented by 1, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0', and `s[right]` must not be '0'**.

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `right` being incremented by 1, while maintaining all other conditions and values as specified in the initial state.
