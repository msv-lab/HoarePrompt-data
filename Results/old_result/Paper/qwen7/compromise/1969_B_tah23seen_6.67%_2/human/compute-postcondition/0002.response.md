Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 1; `s` is a list containing the integer value of the first character of `sChar`.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(i)` appends the integer value of the first character of `sChar` to the list `s`. Since `sChar` is a binary string, the first character is either '0' or '1', and its integer value is either 0 or 1. The length of `sChar` remains at least 1, and `s` now contains one element, which is the integer value of the first character of `sChar`.
