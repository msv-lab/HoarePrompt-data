Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2.
   - `s` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the integer value of the second character of the original `sChar`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in `sChar` using the variable `i`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the current character being processed in `sChar`.
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `sChar`, after processing one character, the next character in `sChar` will be processed in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `sChar`.
   - After processing one character, `i` will be the next character in `sChar`.
   - The length of `sChar` remains the same, but since we are moving to the next character, the condition for the loop to continue (i.e., `sChar` having at least 2 characters) still holds true.

5. **New State:**
   - `sChar` will now be the remaining part of the string after removing the first character.
   - `i` will be the next character in the new `sChar`.
   - The list `s` does not change because it was initialized based on the second character of the original `sChar`, and the loop body did not modify it.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 1, `s` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the integer value of the second character of the original `sChar`, `i` is the next character in the new `sChar`**.
