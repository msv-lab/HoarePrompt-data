Output State: **`left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 1, `right` is greater than 5, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'; `s[left]` and `s[right]` have swapped values.**

Explanation: The code swaps the values of `s[left]` and `s[right]`. Since `left` is 5 and `right` is greater than 5, let's denote the value of `right` as `r` (where `r > 5`). After the swap, `s[5]` and `s[r]` will have exchanged their positions. All other conditions and the structure of `s` remain unchanged.
