Output State: **`left` is 11, `s[6]` is not '1', `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` is `right` + 2 and `s[right]` is not '0'**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was `right` + 1, so after executing the code, `right` becomes `right` + 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
