Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `left` is 4
   - `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`
   - `cost` is `right - left + 1`
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`
   - The length of `s` must be at least 2
   - `s[1]` must not be '1'
   - No character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop head contains two conditions: `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.
   - We need to ensure both conditions are met for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - For `left < len(s)` to be true, `left` must be less than `len(s)`.
     - Currently, `left` is 4, and `right` (which is the length of `s`) must be at least 5 for `left < right` to be true.
   - For `s[left] != '1'` to be true, `s[left]` must not be '1'.
     - Since `left` is 4, `s[4]` must not be '1'.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure:
- `left` is less than `len(s)`
- `s[4]` is not '1'

Since `right` (the length of `s`) must be at least 5, we can set `right` to 5 (or any value greater than 4). And `s[4]` must not be '1'.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`left` is 4, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - left + 1`, `right` is 5, `s[1]` must not be '1', and `s[4]` must not be '1'**
