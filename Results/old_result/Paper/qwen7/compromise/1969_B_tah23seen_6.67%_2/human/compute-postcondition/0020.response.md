Output State: **`left` is 1, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - left + 1`, `right` is 3, and `s[2]` must not be '0'**.

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was 2, so after executing this line, `right` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
