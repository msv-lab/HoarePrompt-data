Reasoning:
1. The provided code reads multiple test cases, where each test case is a binary string.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with the string `sChar`.
3. The function `func_1` aims to sort the binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings and calculates the minimum total cost required to do so.
4. The logic in `func_1` involves iterating through the string and swapping characters to move '0's to the left and '1's to the right, calculating the cost of each swap.
5. However, the provided explanation and the final cost calculation in the function are incorrect. The explanation suggests that `left` and `right` will both eventually be equal to the length of `s`, leading to a cost of `len(s) - 10`. This is not accurate because the logic does not correctly account for the positions of '0's and '1's and the actual cost calculation.
6. The function should identify segments of '1's and '0's, and for each segment of '1's followed by '0's, the cost is calculated as the length of the segment. The function should sum these costs to get the total minimum cost.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
