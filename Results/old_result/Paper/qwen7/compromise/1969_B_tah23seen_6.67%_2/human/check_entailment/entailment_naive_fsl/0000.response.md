Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Specifically, the program attempts to swap adjacent characters directly, which is not an efficient approach for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
101011

Expected Output:
9
```

However, the program outputs:
```
5
```

The correct solution involves finding the minimum cost by identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then performing cyclic shifts to sort the remaining part of the string. The given program does not handle this logic correctly. It tries to swap adjacent characters directly, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a brief outline of the correct approach:
1. Identify the longest prefix that is already sorted.
2. Calculate the cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the remaining part of the string.

This requires a more sophisticated algorithm to correctly compute the minimum cost, which the current implementation does not achieve.
