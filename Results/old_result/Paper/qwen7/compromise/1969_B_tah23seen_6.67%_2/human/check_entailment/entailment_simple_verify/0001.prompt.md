You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: s is a list containing all the integer values of each character in sChar, and i is the last character in sChar.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is 11, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 11, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to increment `left` until it reaches the end of the string `s` or encounters a '1'. Given that `left` is 11 after the third iteration and the loop condition `left < len(s)` must hold, `left` will continue to increment until it reaches the length of `s`. This means `left` will be equal to the length of `s`, making `right` also equal to the length of `s` since the loop terminates when `left` equals `right`. 
    #
    #Since the loop increments `cost` by `right - left + 1` each time it swaps elements, and `right` is now equal to `len(s)`, the final value of `cost` will be `len(s) - 11 + 1 = len(s) - 10`. Given that `left` is 11, the length of `s` must be at least 11 for the loop to have completed its iterations. Therefore, `cost` will be `11` if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and it will increase accordingly if the length of `s` is greater than 11. The other variables remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration.
    return cost
    #The program returns a cost value which is 11 if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and increases by 1 for each additional character beyond 11 in the length of `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(s)` for each test case and prints the result, which is correct.
3. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `s`, iterates through the string `sChar` to convert it into a list of characters, and sets initial values for `left`, `right`, and `cost`.
   - **Main Loop**: The main loop runs until `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `right` is within the bounds of the list.
     - If a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, it swaps them and increments the cost by the length of the substring between `left` and `right`.
     - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.
   - **Edge Cases**: The logic handles the edge cases where the entire string might be already sorted or needs multiple shifts to become sorted.
   - **Return Statement**: The function returns the accumulated cost after processing the entire string.

Given the provided problem description and the implementation of the function, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
