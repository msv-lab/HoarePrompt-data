Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)`. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by converting the binary string `sChar` into a list of characters `s`.
   - It then initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable to keep track of the total cost.
   - The function uses two nested while loops to find the first '0' from the right (`right`) and the first '1' from the left (`left`).
   - When a '0' is found to the right of a '1', it swaps them and increments the cost by the length of the substring being swapped.
   - The function continues this process until either `left` or `right` exceeds the bounds of the list or `left` equals `right`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation logic seems flawed. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the cost is always the length of the string minus the position of `left` after the loop completes. This is not accurate because the cost should be the sum of the lengths of all substrings that were swapped during the process.
   - The explanation provided in the annotated program suggests that the cost is always 11, which is incorrect. The actual cost depends on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string and the number of swaps performed.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example "10", the correct cost should be 2 (swapping "1" and "0").
   - For "0000", the correct cost is 0 (the string is already sorted).
   - For "11000", the correct cost is 6 (swapping "11000" to "00011").
   - For "101011", the correct cost is 9 (as explained in the problem statement).

Given these points, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string. The provided implementation has a logical error in the cost calculation.

Correctness: **False**
