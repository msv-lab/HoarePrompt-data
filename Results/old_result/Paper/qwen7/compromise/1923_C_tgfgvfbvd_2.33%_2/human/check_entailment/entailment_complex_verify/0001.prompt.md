You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, and `p` will be a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. The variable `m` will hold the total number of iterations the loop executed. For each query, the variable `s` will be calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` and checked against the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))`. If the condition is met, 'YES' will be printed; otherwise, 'NO'. After processing all queries, the loop will terminate, and the final state of `m` will reflect the total number of queries processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), a list \( l \) of \( n \) positive integers, and \( m \) queries. It calculates the cumulative sums of the list \( l \) and then for each query, it determines if the sum of any subarray within the specified range meets a specific condition. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the length of the array `c` and the number of queries.
   - It then reads the array `c` and calculates the prefix sums `p` where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `c`.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `a` and `b` which define the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b-1]`.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums: `s = p[b-1] - p[a-2]` if `a > 1`, otherwise `s = p[b-1]`.
   - It checks if the subarray sum `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray (`2 * (b - a + 1)`).

3. **Checking if Subarray is Good:**
   - If `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Reasoning

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sum array `p` is correctly calculated, and it allows efficient computation of subarray sums.

2. **Subarray Sum Check:**
   - The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is used to check if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that meets the criteria:
     - The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray to allow for at least one pair of elements to be swapped while maintaining the sum and ensuring all elements in `b` are positive and different from `a`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case when `a == 1` by directly using `p[b-1]` without subtracting `p[-1]`.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' in the required format.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description. It efficiently uses prefix sums to compute subarray sums and checks the necessary conditions.
