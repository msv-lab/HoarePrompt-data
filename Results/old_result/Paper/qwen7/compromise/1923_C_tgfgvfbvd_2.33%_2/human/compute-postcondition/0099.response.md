Output State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input integers provided during the loop's execution, `m` is `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` with the final adjustments made during each iteration of the loop; the list `l` is updated with user input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the existing list `l`. All other variables (`c`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values, but the list `l` is now updated with the new input values.
