Output State: `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` will be a list starting with 0 and then each subsequent element will be the cumulative sum of all elements in `l` up to that point, `l` will remain unchanged from its initial state, `m` will be the length of `l` plus one, `n` will remain as the last input integer provided during the loop's execution, and `s` will be the difference between the last and second last elements in the list `p`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in the list `l`.
- `p` will be a list where the first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
- The list `l` will retain its original values.
- `m` will be the length of `l` incremented by one.
- `n` will be the last integer input during the loop's execution.
- `s` will be the difference between the last and second last elements in the list `p`.
