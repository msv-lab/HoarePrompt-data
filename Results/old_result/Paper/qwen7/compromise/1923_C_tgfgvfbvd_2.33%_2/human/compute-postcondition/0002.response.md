Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
