Output State: **`c` is the initial value of `c` plus twice the previous value of `x`, `l` must contain at least one fewer element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` from the previous iteration and now also contains the current value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. The values of `c` and `x` are updated according to their initial conditions, and `l` loses at least one of its elements. The list `p` now includes both the previous value of `c` and the current value of `c`.
