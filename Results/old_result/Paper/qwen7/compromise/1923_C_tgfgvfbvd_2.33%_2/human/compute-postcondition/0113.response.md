Output State: `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum up to that point in the list `l`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `c` will hold the sum of all integers in the list `l`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, meaning each element in `p` represents the sum of all elements in `l` up to that point in the iteration.
