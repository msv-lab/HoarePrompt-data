Postcondition: **`a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `m` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the input split.** 

This postcondition covers the case where `a - 2 >= 0`, as `s` is defined as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, and `a` and `b` are reassigned from the input split regardless of the condition. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains consistent with the if part.
