Output State: **`i` is 4, `nn` is 1, `factors` is a dictionary with key 2 and value 2, key 3 and value 3, and `primes` is [2, 3]**.

Explanation: The code `primes = list(factors.keys())` creates a list of keys from the dictionary `factors`. Since `factors` contains keys 2 and 3, `primes` will be a list containing these keys, i.e., `[2, 3]`. The values of `i`, `nn`, and `factors` remain unchanged.
