Output State: **`prime_to_i` is equal to `prime` * `prime_to_i`, `factors` is a dictionary that must contain the key `prime`, and the value associated with `prime` is decreased by 1, and a value equal to `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation: The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to be equal to its current value (`prime_to_i`) multiplied by `prime`. The dictionary `factors` remains unchanged except for the value associated with the key `prime`, which is decreased by 1. Additionally, a value equal to `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded, but since the question asks for the output state and not the yielded value, the yielded value is not included in the final output state description.
