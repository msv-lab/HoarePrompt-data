Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1()`.
2. The function iterates through each character of the string `a` and checks if the corresponding character in `b` matches.
3. If a match is found, it increments the counter `k` and moves to the next character in `b`.
4. The loop terminates when either the end of `a` is reached or the end of `b` is reached without finding a match for all characters of `a`.
5. The function prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum prefix length of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function appears to be correctly implemented. It processes each test case as required and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
