#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations the loop executed, and it is still less than `m`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is the string input by the user, `b` is the string input by the user, `k` is the count of matching characters between `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` stopped, and for every index `i` from 0 to `j-1`, `b[j]` must be equal to `a[i]` if `j` did not reach `m` during the loop's execution.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the count of matching characters between `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` stopped)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings \(a\) and \(b\) of lengths \(n\) and \(m\) respectively. It counts the number of positions up to which the characters in \(a\) and \(b\) match and prints this count. The function does not return any value but prints the count of matching characters.
