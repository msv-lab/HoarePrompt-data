Output State: **`j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations the loop executed, and it will still be less than `m`. Additionally, after all iterations, `b[j]` will not be equal to `a[i]`. The condition `j < m` is false, and we break out of the loop.**

This means that the loop has been broken out of, but the values of `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, `a[i]`, and the condition `j < m` remain as they were before the break statement was executed.
