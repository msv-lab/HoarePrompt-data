Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is the string input by the user, `b` is the string input by the user, `k` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `k` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
