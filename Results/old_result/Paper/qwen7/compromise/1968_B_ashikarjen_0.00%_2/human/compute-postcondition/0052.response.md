Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations the loop executed, and it is still less than `m`.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is the second integer entered.
- `a` is the string input by the user.
- `b` is the string input by the user.
- `k` is the count of matching characters between `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` stopped.
- For every index `i` from 0 to `j-1`, `b[j]` must be equal to `a[i]` if `j` did not reach `m` during the loop's execution.

The `print(k)` statement will print the count of matching characters between strings `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` stopped. Since `j` is the point where the loop stopped and for every index `i` from 0 to `j-1`, `b[j]` must be equal to `a[i]`, this means that `k` is the length of the substring of `a` that matches with the corresponding substring of `b` up to the point where `j` stopped.

Output: **k (where k is the count of matching characters between `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` stopped)**
