Output State: The value of `j` will be equal to the original value of `j` plus the total number of iterations plus 1, and `j` will be less than `m`. Additionally, for every iteration, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will have been incremented by the total number of iterations plus one, and it will still satisfy the condition `j < m`. Furthermore, during each iteration of the loop, the condition `b[j] != a[i]` must hold true.
