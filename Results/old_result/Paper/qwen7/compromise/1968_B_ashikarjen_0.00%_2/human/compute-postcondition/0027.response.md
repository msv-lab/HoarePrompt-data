Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be incremented until it is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` becomes equal to `a[i]`. Therefore, `j` will be equal to the smallest index where `b[j] == a[i]` or `j` will be equal to `m` if `b[j]` never equals `a[i]` within the bounds of the loop. Additionally, `j` will be less than or equal to `m`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `j` will point to the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` or will reach `m` if `a[i]` does not appear in `b`.
