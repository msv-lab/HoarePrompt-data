Output State: **`j` will be equal to the original value of `j` plus the total number of iterations plus 1, and `j` will be greater than or equal to `m`. Additionally, for every iteration, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `j` or `m`, nor does it affect the condition that `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` for every iteration. It only indicates that the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
