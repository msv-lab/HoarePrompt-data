Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` + 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is the string input by the user, `b` is the string input by the user, `k` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `j` was initially equal to `m` + 1. After executing `j += 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, making it equal to `m` + 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
