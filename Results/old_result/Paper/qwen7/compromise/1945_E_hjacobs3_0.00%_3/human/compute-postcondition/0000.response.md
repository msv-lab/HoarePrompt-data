Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and `n` is the length of `array`, and `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(array)` calculates the length of the list `array` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `array` and `find` remains unchanged. Therefore, `array` is still a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and `find` is still an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
