Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the expected increase in friendship values over the k excursions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**: The program calculates the sum of friendship values without considering the probability of choosing each pair. It also incorrectly uses modular inverse and multiplication in a way that doesn't align with the expected value calculation.

2. **Missing Probability Consideration**: The program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends. For each excursion, the probability of choosing a specific pair is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), but the program does not incorporate this into the expected value calculation.

3. **Incorrect Use of Modular Inverse**: The program uses `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` to compute the modular inverse, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem at hand. The modular inverse is used incorrectly here.

4. **Simplistic Summation**: The program simply sums the friendship values and multiplies by a constant factor, which does not reflect the expected value calculation required by the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair, taking into account the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship values over the k excursions. This involves a more complex calculation involving probabilities and expected values.
