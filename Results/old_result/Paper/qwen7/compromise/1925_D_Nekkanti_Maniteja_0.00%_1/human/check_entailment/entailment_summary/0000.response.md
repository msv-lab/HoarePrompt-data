Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases `t` and processing each one individually.
2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The calculation of the modular inverse `c` of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \( M \) is done correctly using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This step ensures that `c` is the multiplicative inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) under modulo \( M \).
3. **Sum of Friendship Values (`a`)**: The program correctly accumulates the sum of friendship values `a` for each test case.
4. **Calculation of Expected Value**: The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. However, the formula used in the code is incorrect. The intended formula should be based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in friendship value due to repeated selections.

The intended formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions is:

\[ E[\text{sum}] = k \cdot \left( \frac{\text{sum of friendship values}}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

Where:
- \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) is the total number of unique pairs.
- The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{\text{sum of friendship values}}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

Given the above, the program should compute the expected value correctly and then take the result modulo \( M \).

However, the current implementation uses an incorrect formula:

\[ s = \sum_{i=100000+m}^{100000+3m} (c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a) \]

This formula does not reflect the intended calculation of the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to compute the expected value.

Correctness: **False**
