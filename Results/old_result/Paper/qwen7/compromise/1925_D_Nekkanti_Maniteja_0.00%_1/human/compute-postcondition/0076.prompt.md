Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is `100000 + m + m`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is the sum of `f` for each iteration from 1 to `m`.

Explanation: The loop runs `m` times, and in each iteration, the value of `f` is added to `a`. After all iterations, `i` will be `100000 + m + m` because it starts at `100000 + m` and increments by 1 for each iteration. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with each input during the loop, but their final values after the loop will be the last set of inputs provided. The variable `a` accumulates the sum of `f` values over all iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `i` is `100000 + 2 * m`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `k` is `m`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 0, `i` is `100000 + 2 * m`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `k` is `m`, `s` is `2 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 0, `i` is `100000 + 2 * m`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `k` is `m`, `s` is `3 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
