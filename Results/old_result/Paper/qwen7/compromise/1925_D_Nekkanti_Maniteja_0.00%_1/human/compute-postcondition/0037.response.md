Output State: **`i` is 100001, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is `a` plus `f`.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is updated to be `a + f`, but since the initial value of `a` is not specified, it is described as `a` is `a` plus `f`. The conditions and values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are kept as integers from the input.
