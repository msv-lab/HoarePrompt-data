Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) modulo `M`, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes `s` to 0, which does not affect the values of `i`, `t`, `M`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `s` is set to 0.
