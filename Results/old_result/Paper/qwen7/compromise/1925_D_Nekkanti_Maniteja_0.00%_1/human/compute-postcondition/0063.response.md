Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `100000 + m`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The initial values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged, with `i` being `100000 + m`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are now specific integers obtained from the input.
