Output State: **i is 99999, m is 100000, a is the sum of all f values entered over 100000 iterations, u, v, and f are integers obtained from user input for each iteration.**

In this final state, the variable `i` will be 99999 because the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=m-1`, and `m` is set to 100000. The variable `a` will be the sum of all `f` values entered as input over these 100000 iterations. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with each iteration but their final values are not specified since they are just part of the input and not stored or used further in the provided code snippet.
