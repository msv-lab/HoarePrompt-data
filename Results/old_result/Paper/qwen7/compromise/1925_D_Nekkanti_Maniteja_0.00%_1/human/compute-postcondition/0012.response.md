Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < m`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `a` is `a` + `f`, `u`, and `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from user input.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than or equal to 2 (since `i` is now 2).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `m` must remain greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is `a` + `f`, `u`, and `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from user input**.
