Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `100001 + m`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is `a` + `f`, `u` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The values of `total`, `i`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged.
