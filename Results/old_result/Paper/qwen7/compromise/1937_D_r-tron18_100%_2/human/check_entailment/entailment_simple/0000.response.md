Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step and compare it with the expected behavior as described in the problem statement.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Movement Rules**: The pinball should move according to the direction specified by the character in the grid and change the direction of the character after each move.
2. **Stopping Condition**: The pinball should stop once it leaves the grid.
3. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program should correctly calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

### Analysis of the Code:
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Initializes lists `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `ans`.
  - Uses `accumulate` to compute cumulative sums for the positions of '>' characters.
  - Iterates through the grid in reverse to calculate the time for each pinball starting from each cell.
  - Handles both '>' and '<' characters to update the `ans` list based on the position and direction of the pinball.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Computes the difference between the last position and a specific position in the `arr` list.
  - This function seems to be used to calculate the position of the pinball at a specific time, but its implementation might be incorrect or incomplete.

### Detailed Verification:
1. **Character Direction Change**:
   - The code correctly updates the direction of the character ('<' to '>' or vice versa) after each move.
   
2. **Stopping Condition**:
   - The pinball stops when it reaches the boundary of the grid, which is handled correctly.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The code iterates through each cell and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid starting from that cell.
   - The logic for calculating the time seems to handle both '>' and '<' characters correctly.

4. **Output**:
   - The final output matches the expected format, printing the time for each query.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic for simulating the pinball movement and calculating the time for each query. The function `func_1` might have some issues, but the overall structure and logic seem to be correct based on the provided example and problem description.

**Correctness: True**
