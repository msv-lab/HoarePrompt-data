### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and function `func_2` based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains a character `'<>'`, indicating the direction the pinball should move.
   - The pinball starts at each cell and moves according to the rules until it leaves the grid.
   - We need to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(arr, times)`: This function calculates a value based on the array `arr` and an integer `times`. However, this function is not directly relevant to solving the main problem.
   - `func_2(s1, n)`: This function processes the input string `s1` and calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

3. **Analysis of `func_2(s1, n)`:**
   - The function initializes several lists and accumulates values.
   - It iterates through the string `s1` in reverse order.
   - For each character, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using various conditions and accumulated values.
   - The logic involves checking the direction of the pinball (`>` or `<`) and updating the positions accordingly.

4. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The function correctly handles the movement of the pinball based on the direction specified in the string.
   - The function accounts for the inversion of directions after each move.
   - The function correctly calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided example test cases show the expected output for different inputs.
   - The function `func_2` seems to handle the logic correctly by maintaining the necessary accumulations and conditions.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic in `func_2`:

- The function `func_2` uses complex accumulations and conditions to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. These calculations seem overly complicated and may not accurately reflect the simple movement rules described in the problem.
- The function `func_2` does not properly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of directions. Instead, it attempts to calculate the time based on accumulated values, which might lead to incorrect results.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Incorrect Accumulation Logic:** The function uses accumulations and conditions that do not directly correspond to the simple movement rules. For example, the use of `func_1` and the complex updates to `preOne` and `suffZero` do not accurately simulate the pinball movement.
- **Complexity and Incorrect Output:** The function's logic is overly complex and may produce incorrect results due to the misinterpretation of the problem's rules.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using complex accumulations and conditions, which do not accurately reflect the simple movement rules.

### Final Answer
