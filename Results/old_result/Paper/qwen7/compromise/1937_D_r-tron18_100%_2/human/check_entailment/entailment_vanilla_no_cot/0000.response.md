Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` does not accurately reflect the pinball's movement and the inversion of the direction at each step. The function attempts to use prefix sums and accumulations but does not properly handle the pinball's movement and the grid's boundaries.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the movement of the pinball for each starting position individually, taking into account the direction changes and the grid boundaries. Here is a more appropriate approach using simulation:

```python
def simulate_pinball(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        pos = i
        time = 0
        while 0 <= pos < n:
            if s[pos] == '<':
                pos -= 1
            else:
                pos += 1
            # Invert the direction
            s = s[:pos] + ('>' if s[pos] == '<' else '<') + s[pos+1:]
            time += 1
        ans.append(time)
    return ans

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = simulate_pinball(s)
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This code simulates the movement of the pinball for each starting position, updating the position and the direction accordingly until the pinball leaves the grid. This approach ensures that the pinball's movement and the grid boundaries are handled correctly.
