Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `s1`, a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, an integer indicating the length of `s1`. The function returns a specific value based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`.**

- If the number of '<' characters is greater than the number of '>' characters, the function returns the difference between the counts.
- If the number of '>' characters is greater than the number of '<' characters, the function returns the negative of the difference between the counts.
- If the number of '<' characters equals the number of '>' characters, the function returns 0.
