Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
