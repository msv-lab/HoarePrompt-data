Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop.
   - The loop runs from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts at `n-1` and decrements until `-1`, the initial value of `i` should be `n-1`.

3. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to `n-1` initially and that the condition `i >= 0` holds true for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`.
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0.
- `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `i` must be set to `n-1` initially and must satisfy the condition `i >= 0`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n-1` and must be greater than or equal to 0**.
