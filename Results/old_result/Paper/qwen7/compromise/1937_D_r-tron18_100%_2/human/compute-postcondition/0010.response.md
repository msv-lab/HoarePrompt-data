Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` of `n` integers. Each element in `ans` represents the difference between the number of zeros and ones under certain conditions derived from the balance of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The function processes the string `s1` from right to left, updating the counts and lists `preOne` and `suffZero` accordingly, and finally prints the list `ans`.**
