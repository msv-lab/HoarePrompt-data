Output State: The output state will consist of a series of results, each being the square of the absolute difference in y-coordinates for specific pairs of points, based on the conditions provided within the loop. Each result is printed after the corresponding iteration of the loop. The number of results will be equal to the number of test cases (denoted by `a`).
