Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by two strings `row1` and `row2`. It then calls `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to compute a result based on the comparison of `row1` and `row2`. Finally, it collects all these results into a list and prints them, each on a new line.**
