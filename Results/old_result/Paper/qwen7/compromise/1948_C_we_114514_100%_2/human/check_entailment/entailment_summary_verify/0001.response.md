### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`. Let's re-evaluate the function `func_1` and the overall program to confirm this conclusion.

#### Re-evaluation of `func_1`

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (excluding the last column) and checks if the robot can get stuck in the middle due to arrows pointing left.
   - Specifically, it checks if the arrow in `row1` at position `2*i + 1` is `<` and if the arrows in `row2` at positions `2*i` or `2*i + 2` are also `<`. If this condition is met, it returns `'No'` because the robot cannot escape to the right.
   - After the loop, it checks the last column separately.
   - If none of the conditions are met, it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly identifies cases where the robot gets stuck in the middle of the grid.
   - However, it does not account for the possibility of the robot navigating through the grid using a combination of left and right movements to reach the last column.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The function assumes that if the robot reaches the last column, it will always be able to move to `(2, n)`. This assumption is not entirely correct because the robot must follow the arrows correctly.
   - The function does not handle the case where the robot can navigate through the grid using a combination of left and right movements to reach the last column.

4. **Test Case Verification**:
   - The provided examples show that the function fails to correctly identify some cases where the robot can reach `(2, n)`.
   - For instance, in the fourth example, the function incorrectly returns `'No'` when the robot can actually reach `(2, 6)`.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
