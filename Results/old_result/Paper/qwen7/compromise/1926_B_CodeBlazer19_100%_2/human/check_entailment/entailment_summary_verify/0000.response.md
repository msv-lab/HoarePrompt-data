### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Triangle Detection Issue:**
   - The program checks if each row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to determine a triangle. A triangle requires a specific pattern where the number of '1's increases and then decreases symmetrically around the center. For example, consider the following grid:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     This grid contains a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the second and third rows both contain more than one '1'.

2. **Square Detection Issue:**
   - The program checks if each row contains more than one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a square. This is also not sufficient. A square requires a specific pattern where the number of '1's in each row is constant. For example, consider the following grid:
     ```
     0000
     0000
     0111
     0111
     ```
     This grid contains a square, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a triangle because the first two rows contain only one '1'.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the shapes based on the specific patterns required for triangles and squares.
