The function processes up to 100 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n followed by an n x n grid of '0's and '1's. The function determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. If a triangle is found, it prints 'TRIANGLE'; if a square is found, it prints 'SQUARE'. If neither shape is found, it prints an appropriate message indicating no valid shape was identified.
