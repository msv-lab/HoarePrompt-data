Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string, `n` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `n-1`, and `s` holds the last input string provided.**

Explanation: The line `a = 0` sets the variable `a` to 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `b`, `n`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
