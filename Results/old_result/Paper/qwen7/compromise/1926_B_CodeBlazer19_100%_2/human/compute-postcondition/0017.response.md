Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s` has either exactly one occurrence of the character '1' (in which case `a` is 'TRIANGLE'), or more than one or no such occurrence (in which case `a` is 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string').
