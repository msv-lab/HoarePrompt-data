Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes t test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n followed by a grid of n x n characters ('0' or '1'). The function identifies whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. It then returns the type of shape (triangle or square) found for each test case. If no valid shape is found, it returns an appropriate message indicating no valid shape was identified.**
