Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the input string provided by the user, and the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1.**

In this case, the variable `a` is assigned the string `'TRIANGLE'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
