Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0.
   - `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `s` is a string input from the user.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `j < n`, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Final state before the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same (an integer between 1 and 100).
   - `i` remains the same (0).
   - `a` remains the same ('TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0).
   - `b` remains the same ('SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE').
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).
   - `j` becomes 2.
   - `s` remains the same (a string input from the user).

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a string input from the user**.
