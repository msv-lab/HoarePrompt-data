Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string, `n` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `n-1`, and `s` holds the last input string provided.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
