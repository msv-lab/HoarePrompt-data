You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of t test cases, each test case starts with an integer n followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, with the size of the triangle or square being greater than 1.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 100, i is 99, a is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings s entered during the loop iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise a is 0, b is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings s entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise b remains an empty string, n is the total number of inputs provided by the user over all iterations, j is 0, and s is the last input string provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes t test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n followed by a grid of n x n characters ('0' or '1'). The function identifies whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. It then returns the type of shape (triangle or square) found for each test case. If no valid shape is found, it returns an appropriate message indicating no valid shape was identified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
