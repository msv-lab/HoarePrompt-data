Output State: **`t` is 5, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` finds the index of the element `i` in the list `b` and assigns it to the variable `x`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is still the next element in the list `s`, and `x` now holds the index of `i` in the list `b`.
