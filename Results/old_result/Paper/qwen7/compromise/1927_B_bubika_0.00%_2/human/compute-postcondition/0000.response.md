Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, a is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.

In this code snippet, the variable `a` is reassigned from being a list to a string containing all lowercase English alphabets. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
