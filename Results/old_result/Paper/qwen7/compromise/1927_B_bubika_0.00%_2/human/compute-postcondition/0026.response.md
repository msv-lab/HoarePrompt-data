Output State: **`s` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the original `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` finds the index of the element `i` in the list `b` and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial conditions state that `s` has at least one element and `i` is the first element of `s`, but these conditions do not directly affect the value of `x`. Therefore, the only change is that `x` now holds the index of `i` in list `b`.
