Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `b` is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is 'aaaaa' (where 'a' repeats `n` times), `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the first element of the original `s`, `b[x]` is `i` + (number of times the loop has executed - 1), `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `b` is a list where each element is incremented based on its occurrence in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `r` will be a concatenated string of elements from list `a` corresponding to the indices in list `b` as each element in `s` appears in the list `s`. The list `b` will have each element incremented by the count of its occurrences in `s`, and `t` will be equal to the length of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is 5, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers, `r` is the concatenation of `a[i]` for each `i` in `s`, where `i` is taken from the current value of `b` and the corresponding entry in `a`, and `b` is a list where each element has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `s`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains 5, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains the same list of integers, `b` contains the count of each integer in `s`, and `r` is a string formed by concatenating the elements of `a` based on the indices specified by the elements in `s`, with each index in `b` incremented by the count of its occurrence in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
