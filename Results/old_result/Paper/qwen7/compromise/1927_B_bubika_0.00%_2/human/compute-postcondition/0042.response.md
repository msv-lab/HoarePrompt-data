Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer. The resulting list of integers is stored in `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
