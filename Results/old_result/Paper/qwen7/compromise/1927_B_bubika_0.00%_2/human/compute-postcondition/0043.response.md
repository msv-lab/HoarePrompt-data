Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `r` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `r`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables while adding that `r` is now an empty string.
