Postcondition: **`i` is 10, `x` is at least 1023, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.** 

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Since the condition `i == 0` is false, the else part is executed. In the else part, `i` remains 10, `x` is set to 1022, `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `subseq_lens` becomes a list containing the value 10. The value of `mx` (which was mentioned in the else part but not in the precondition or if part) is set to 10, indicating that `mx` is updated to the current value of `i` in the else part.
