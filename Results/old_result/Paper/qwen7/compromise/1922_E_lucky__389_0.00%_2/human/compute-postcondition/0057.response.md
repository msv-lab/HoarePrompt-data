Output State: `i` is 10, `x` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10 three times, and `mx` is 10.

Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop reduces `x` by `2^i - 1`, where `i` is the value found by the inner while loop. Since `x` starts at 1023 and decreases by 1023 in the first iteration, it becomes 0 after the first iteration. However, since the problem specifies the state after the loop executes 3 times, we can infer that `x` must be reduced further in subsequent iterations, but given the nature of the loop, once `x` reaches a point where no valid `i` can be found (i.e., `2^(i+1) > x+1`), the loop breaks. Given the constraints and the fact that `x` is reduced by the maximum possible value each time (`2^10 - 1 = 1023`), it's clear that `x` will reach 0 after the third iteration, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be 0, `i` will still be 10 (as it was set in the last iteration), `subseq_lens` will contain 10 three times, and `mx` will remain 10.
