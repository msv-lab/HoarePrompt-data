Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 9
- `x` is 0
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing `[10, 10, 10]`
- `mx` is 10
- `ansv` is a list containing `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`

The `print()` statement does not have any arguments, meaning it will print nothing. Therefore, the output will be an empty string.

Output: **None**
