The function processes a single test case where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `X` is an integer between 2 and 10^18. It calculates a sequence of integers stored in `subseq_lens` and constructs a new list `ansv` based on these values. Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` followed by its elements. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
