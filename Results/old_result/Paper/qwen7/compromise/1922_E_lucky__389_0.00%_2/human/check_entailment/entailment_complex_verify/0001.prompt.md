You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 10, `x` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10 three times, and `mx` is 10.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop reduces `x` by `2^i - 1`, where `i` is the value found by the inner while loop. Since `x` starts at 1023 and decreases by 1023 in the first iteration, it becomes 0 after the first iteration. However, since the problem specifies the state after the loop executes 3 times, we can infer that `x` must be reduced further in subsequent iterations, but given the nature of the loop, once `x` reaches a point where no valid `i` can be found (i.e., `2^(i+1) > x+1`), the loop breaks. Given the constraints and the fact that `x` is reduced by the maximum possible value each time (`2^10 - 1 = 1023`), it's clear that `x` will reach 0 after the third iteration, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be 0, `i` will still be 10 (as it was set in the last iteration), `subseq_lens` will contain 10 three times, and `mx` will remain 10.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, `x` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10 three times, and `mx` is 10; `ansv` is a list containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the length of `subseq_lens`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of `subseq_lens` because the loop runs from 1 to the length of `subseq_lens` minus one. The loop appends each element of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element (index 1) to `ansv`. Therefore, `ansv` will contain all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end of the list. The other variables (`x`, `t`, and `mx`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 3
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: i is 9, x is 0, t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, subseq_lens is a list containing [10, 10, 10], mx is 10, ansv is a list containing [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10].
    print()
    #This is printed: None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a single test case where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `X` is an integer between 2 and 10^18. It calculates a sequence of integers stored in `subseq_lens` and constructs a new list `ansv` based on these values. Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` followed by its elements. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`).
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be determined by the number of ways to choose elements from the array in increasing order.
   - The problem suggests using powers of 2 to construct the array, which corresponds to the binary representation of `X`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x`, which is `X - 1`.
   - It then constructs the list `subseq_lens` to represent the binary representation of `x + 1`.
   - The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum value in `subseq_lens`.
   - The list `ansv` is constructed based on the values in `subseq_lens`.
   - Finally, the length of `ansv` and its elements are printed.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly converts `x + 1` to its binary representation and constructs the array based on this representation.
   - The array construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
   - The code handles the special case where `x` is 0 by breaking out of the loop.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2, resulting in an array of length 1 with a single element 0.
   - For larger `X`, the code correctly constructs the array using the binary representation.

5. **Validation:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.
