Reasoning:

The given program aims to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken in the program is to decompose `X-1` into a sum of powers of 2, which corresponds to the lengths of the segments in the constructed array. This method ensures that the resulting array has the desired number of increasing subsequences.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Decomposition of `X-1`**: For each test case, it subtracts 1 from `X` and then decomposes this value into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This decomposition helps in constructing the array.
3. **Constructing the Array**: The program constructs the array by repeating the largest power of 2 found in the decomposition and then appending the smaller powers of 2 in descending order.
4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the constructed array followed by the elements of the array.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the program appears to correctly generate arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences. The approach leverages the properties of binary representation and combinatorial counting, ensuring that the constructed array meets the requirements.

Based on the provided execution summary and the logical steps outlined above, the program seems to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
