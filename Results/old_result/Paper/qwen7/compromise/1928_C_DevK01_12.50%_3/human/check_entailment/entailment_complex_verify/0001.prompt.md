You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. Both q and x satisfy 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: q is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, w is the square root of q, and if w is an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is [w]. Otherwise, M remains unchanged.

    return M
    #M is a list containing integers i and q//i for each i in the range(1, int(w // 1)) such that either i or q//i is greater than or equal to x - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where `q` represents Vasya's position in the line and `x` represents the number Vasya received during the settling. It returns a list `M` containing integers `i` and `q//i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `q`, such that either `i` or `q//i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, no valid `k` can exist since `2k - 2` must be even.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is used to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic in `func_1` is as follows:
     - Calculate the square root of `q` and check if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If true, add it to the list `M`.
     - Iterate through all integers from `1` to the integer part of the square root of `q` and check if they are divisors of `q`. If they are and are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, add them to `M`.
     - Similarly, check the corresponding divisors `q // i` and add them to `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates `L1` using `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the results of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.
   - `L1` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

### Verification:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `y` odd, the program correctly prints `0`.
   - For `y` even, the program calculates the divisors correctly and ensures that the divisors are within the required range.

2. **Mathematical Consistency:**
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that all valid `k` values are found and counted correctly.
   - The main logic correctly handles the conditions for adding elements to `L1`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
