Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but according to the problem statement, `y` should be `2 * n - x`.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`. However, the logic for determining the valid `k` values is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if i >= x - 1` and `if q // i >= x - 1` does not correctly filter the valid `k` values.

3. **Set Conversion**: The use of `set` to remove duplicates before calculating the length is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results. The list `L1` should be directly converted to a set only if necessary, and the length calculation should be done after ensuring all valid `k` values are included.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases where `x` is very close to `n` or when `n` is small compared to `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    y = 2 * n - x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    y //= 2
    w = math.sqrt(y)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        ans += 1
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1) + 1):
        if y % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                ans += 1
            if y // i >= x - 1:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the logic for finding valid `k` values is accurate and handles the problem constraints correctly.
