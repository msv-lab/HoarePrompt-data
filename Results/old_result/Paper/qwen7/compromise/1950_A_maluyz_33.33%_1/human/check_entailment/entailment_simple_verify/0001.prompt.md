You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of strings ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') printed for each iteration of the loop based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each line's output depends on the comparison of these three integers.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a == b == c` and prints 'NONE' if all three numbers are equal.
   - It checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` and prints 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NONE'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where `a > b > c` for 'PEAK'.
   - The program does not handle the case where `a > b < c` or `a < b > c` for 'STAIR'.
   - The program does not handle the case where `a == b` and `b != c` or similar scenarios which should be considered for 'STAIR' or 'PEAK'.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `1 2 3`, the output is 'STAIR' because `1 < 2 < 3`.
- For the input `3 2 1`, the output is 'NONE' because it does not satisfy any of the conditions.
- For the input `1 5 3`, the output is 'PEAK' because `1 < 5 > 3`.
- For the input `3 4 1`, the output is 'PEAK' because `3 < 4 > 1`.
- For the input `0 0 0`, the output is 'NONE' because all three numbers are equal.
- For the input `4 1 7`, the output is 'NONE' because it does not satisfy any of the conditions.
- For the input `4 5 7`, the output is 'STAIR' because `4 < 5 < 7`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly identify all cases for 'STAIR' and 'PEAK'. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where `a > b > c` for 'PEAK' and cases where `a < b > c` or `a > b < c` for 'STAIR'. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.
