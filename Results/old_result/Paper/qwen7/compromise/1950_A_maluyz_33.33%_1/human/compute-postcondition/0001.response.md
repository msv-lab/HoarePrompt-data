State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`.
2. The loop head involves two variables: `i` and `t`.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
4. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins, but the problem asks us to consider the state at the start of the loop, which means `i` should be set to the starting value of the loop, which is 0.
5. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be 0 (or considered as 1 if the loop body modifies `i`).

Given the constraints and the requirement to adjust only the states of objects in the loop head, the correct state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 1**.
