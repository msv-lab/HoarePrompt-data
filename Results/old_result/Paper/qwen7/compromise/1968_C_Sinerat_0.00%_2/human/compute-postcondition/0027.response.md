Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` (which is the final value it reaches after all iterations).
- `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`.
- `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`.
- ...
- `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the values of the list `a`:

1. `a[0]` is initialized to 500.
2. For `a[1]`, it is `a[0] + x[0] = 500 + x[0]`.
3. For `a[2]`, it is `a[1] + x[1] = (500 + x[0]) + x[1] = 500 + x[0] + x[1]`.
4. Continuing this pattern, `a[n-1]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`.

Therefore, the list `a` after all iterations will be `[500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]]`.

The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **500 500 + x[0] 500 + x[0] + x[1] ... 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]**
