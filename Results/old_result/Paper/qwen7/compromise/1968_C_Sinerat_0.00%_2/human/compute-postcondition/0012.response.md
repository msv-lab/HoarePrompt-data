Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0]` and all elements in the list `x` up to index `n-2`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `n` (since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`), `n` must still be greater than 1, and the value of `a[i]` will be the initial value of `a[0]` (which is 500) plus the sum of all elements in the list `x` from index `0` to `n-2`.
