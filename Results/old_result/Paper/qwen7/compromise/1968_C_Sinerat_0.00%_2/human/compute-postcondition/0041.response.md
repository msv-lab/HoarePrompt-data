Based on the initial state provided:

- `a[0]` is 500.
- Each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`.
- After the loop completes, `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has run `n-1` times.
- The list `x` remains unchanged.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the transformation of `a`:

1. `a[0]` is explicitly given as 500.
2. For `a[1]`, it will be the sum of `a[0]` and the first element of `x`.
3. For `a[2]`, it will be the sum of `a[0]`, the first element of `x`, and the second element of `x`.
4. This pattern continues until `a[n-1]`.

Since the exact values of `x` are not provided, we can represent the final state of `a` in a general form. Let's denote the elements of `x` as `x[0], x[1], ..., x[n-1]`.

Therefore, the final list `a` will be:
\[ a = [500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], \ldots, 500 + x[0] + x[1] + \cdots + x[n-2]] \]

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **500 500 + x[0] 500 + x[0] + x[1] ... 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]**
