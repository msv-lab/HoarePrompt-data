Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, the list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) will be the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`, starting with `a[0] = 500`. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, and the list `x` will also remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after running the entire loop, the list `a` will have `n` elements, with `a[0]` being 500 and each subsequent element `a[i]` being the sum of 500 and the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `n` and the list `x` will stay the same as they were initially.
