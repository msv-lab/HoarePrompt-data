Output State: **The value of `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. However, the initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a[i]` and retains the condition that `n` must be greater than 0.
