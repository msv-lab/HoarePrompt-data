Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is `a[2] + x[2]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[3]` to be `a[2] + x[2]`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, and `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`. After executing the code, `a[3]` is calculated as `a[2] + x[2]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
