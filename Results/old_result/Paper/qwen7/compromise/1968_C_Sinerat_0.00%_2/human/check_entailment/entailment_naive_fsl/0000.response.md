Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
2
1
```

Expected output:
```
1 1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
501 500
```

This is incorrect because `a[0]` should be set to a value such that `a[1] % a[0] = x[0]`. In this case, setting `a[0] = 501` and `a[1] = 500` does not satisfy `500 % 501 = 1`, whereas setting `a[0] = 1` and `a[1] = 1` does satisfy `1 % 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
