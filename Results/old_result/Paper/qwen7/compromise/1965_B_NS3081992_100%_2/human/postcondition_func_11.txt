The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the maximum value in `d` (inclusive), an integer `da` representing a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d` (inclusive). If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially 0, updating `processing` and `tmp` accordingly. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns this value.
