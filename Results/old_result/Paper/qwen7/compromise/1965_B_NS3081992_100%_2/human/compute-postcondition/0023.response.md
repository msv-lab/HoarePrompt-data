Output State: **ans is [1, 2, 4, 2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** lk, 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)].**

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `ans` will contain the initial elements `[1, 2, 4, 2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by additional elements `2 ** i` for each `i` in the range from `lk` to `l-1`.
