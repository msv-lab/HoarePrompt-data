Output State: `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, `k` is 1, `l` is 4, `n` is not equal to 2.

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` being 2 and runs until `i` is less than `l`. Given `l` is the length of `b`, and initially `ans` is `[2, 3]`, we can infer that `l` is initially 2 (since the length of `[2, 3]` is 2). However, the loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `l - 1`, so it will run once for `i = 2` and once for `i = 3`, appending `2 ** 2 = 4` and `2 ** 3 = 8` to `ans`. After the loop, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, `k` remains 1, `l` is now 4 (since we appended two more elements to `ans`), and `n` remains not equal to 2.
