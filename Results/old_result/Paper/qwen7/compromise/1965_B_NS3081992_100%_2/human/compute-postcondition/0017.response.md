Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `lk`: This is the length of `bk`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `b`: Binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k`: Second return value of `func_7()`.
   - `bk`: Binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l`: Length of `b`.
   - `lk`: Length of `bk`.
   - `ans`: An empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 2` (since `range(lk - 1)` generates values from 0 to `lk - 2`). Therefore, the loop will execute if `lk` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `lk` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial values of `i` will be set to 0 by the loop itself.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `lk` (which must be greater than 0) and `i` (which will start at 0).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`total` is an empty list, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `lk` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is an empty list**.
