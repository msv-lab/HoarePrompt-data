None of the variables in the function signature are provided in the given program. The function `func_7()` does not take any parameters and its purpose seems to be reading input, which is typically done outside of the function body in the main program flow. However, based on the problem description and the context, it's implied that the function might be part of a larger solution and is expected to read two integers `t` and `n` from the input, where `t` is the number of test cases and for each test case, `n` and `k` are read.
