Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable mentioned in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the `results` list.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `results` list. Therefore, the loop will execute if `results` is not empty.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `results` is a list of 'no' and 'yes' based on certain conditions.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `results` must contain at least one element. If `results` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `results` is not an empty list. 

**State:**
- `results` must be a non-empty list of 'no' and 'yes'.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`results` is a non-empty list of 'no' and 'yes'**.
