Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: Before the loop starts, `results` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means that `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting value) and `t` should be a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

- `i` should be 0.
- `t` should be a positive integer between 1 and 100.

The other variables (`results`, `n`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100**
