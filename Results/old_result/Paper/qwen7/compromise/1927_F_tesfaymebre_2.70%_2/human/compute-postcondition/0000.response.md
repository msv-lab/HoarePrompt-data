Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`**.

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the return value of the function `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `test_cases`. However, we know that `test_cases` is a positive integer because it represents the number of test cases, and the number of test cases must be a positive integer. Therefore, the output state is that `test_cases` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`.
