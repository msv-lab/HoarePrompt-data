You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n-1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and DSU is a disjoint set union data structure initialized with n+1 elements.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: Output State: `graph` is a defaultdict where each key is connected to its corresponding value via bidirectional edges based on the tuples generated by `func_3()` for `m` times, `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples, each tuple consisting of a weight and a pair of connected nodes `(w, u, v)`, and DSU is a disjoint set union data structure initialized with `n+1` elements, representing the connected components of the graph.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: _min_edge is the minimum weight of an edge that was used to union two nodes which already belonged to the same set, node_u and node_v are the nodes involved in that edge. If no such edge exists, _min_edge remains positive infinity (float('inf')), and node_u and node_v remain -1.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: float('inf'), 0
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: [-1, -1, ...] (where the list contains the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal, starting from -1 and ending at the destination node if found)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses predefined variables (n, m, edges, DSU) where n and m are integers with specific constraints, edges is a list of tuples representing weighted edges, and DSU is a disjoint set union data structure. The function processes these inputs to perform some operation and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
