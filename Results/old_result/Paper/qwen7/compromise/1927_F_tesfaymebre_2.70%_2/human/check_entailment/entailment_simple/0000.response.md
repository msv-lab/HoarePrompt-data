Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of vertices \( n \) and the number of edges \( m \).
3. It constructs the graph using an adjacency list representation and stores the edges in a list.
4. The program sorts the edges in descending order of their weights.
5. It uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find cycles. Specifically, it looks for the first edge that connects two vertices in the same component, indicating a cycle. During this process, it keeps track of the minimum weight edge that forms a cycle.
6. After identifying the minimum weight edge that forms a cycle, it performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the vertices involved in this cycle.
7. The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in traversal order.

Given the detailed state transitions and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program is designed to solve the problem as specified. The program correctly identifies the minimum weight edge in a cycle and finds the cycle involving that edge.

Correctness: **True**
