### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the number of vertices \( n \) and edges \( m \) for each test case.
   - It reads the edges and stores them in a graph represented as an adjacency list.
   - It sorts the edges in descending order based on their weights.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization:**
   - A DSU data structure is used to manage connected components.
   - This is initialized with \( n+1 \) elements (to handle 1-based indexing).

3. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges in reverse order (from heaviest to lightest).
   - For each edge, it checks if the two vertices form a cycle by checking if they belong to the same component using the DSU.
   - If they do, it updates the minimum edge weight and the corresponding nodes.
   - If they don't, it unites the components and continues.

4. **Cycle Detection Using DFS:**
   - After finding the minimum weight edge in a cycle, the program uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the actual cycle involving the identified nodes.
   - It uses a `colors` array to keep track of the state of each node during the DFS traversal.
   - If a back-edge is found (a node already visited), it returns the path forming the cycle.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices in the cycle in traversal order.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Test Cases Handling:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
- **Graph Representation:** The graph is correctly represented using an adjacency list.
- **Edge Sorting:** Edges are sorted in descending order, ensuring that the heaviest edges are processed first.
- **Cycle Detection:** The use of DSU and DFS ensures that cycles are detected and the minimum weight edge is found.
- **Output Format:** The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Detailed Evaluation

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_3`, and `func_4` correctly read and parse the input as described.
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The graph is constructed correctly using an adjacency list.
   - The edges are stored in a list and sorted in descending order.

3. **DSU Operations:**
   - The DSU class is implemented correctly with union and find operations.
   - The DSU is used to efficiently manage connected components and find the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

4. **Cycle Finding:**
   - The program correctly identifies cycles using the DSU.
   - The DFS function correctly finds the path forming the cycle and returns the nodes in traversal order.

5. **Output:**
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in traversal order.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and verification against the problem description, the given Python program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight edge for each test case.
