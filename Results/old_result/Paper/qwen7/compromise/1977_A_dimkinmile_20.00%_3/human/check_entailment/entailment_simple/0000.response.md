### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, which are read using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if (n >= m) :` checks whether the number of moves `n` is sufficient to achieve a tower with `m` cubes.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program prints 'Yes'.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, the program prints 'No'.

3. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - It correctly processes the input and prints the appropriate output based on the condition.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for i in range(kreker):` iterates over each test case, ensuring that all test cases are processed.

5. **Postcondition**:
   - After processing each test case, the state of the program is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
