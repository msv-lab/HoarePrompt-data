You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then no changes are made to `n`. If `n` is less than `m`, then no changes are made to `n` either.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a test case consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Based on whether `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints either 'Yes' or 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The variable `kreker` is correctly initialized to read the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs for `kreker` times, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the function correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Given these points, the program logic is almost correct, but there is an issue with the function call within the loop. The function `func_1()` is defined but never called in the main loop. Instead, the loop directly calls the undefined `func_1()` function, which leads to a NameError.

To fix this, we need to call `func_1()` inside the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Should be:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Since the original program does not correctly call the function `func_1()` within the loop, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
