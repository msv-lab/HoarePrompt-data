Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not check all possible sequences of moves that could result in having exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient. 

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider that Nikita can add or remove cubes in any sequence, and the difference between the number of additions and removals must equal `m`. Therefore, the correct condition to check is whether `abs(n - 2 * m)` is even (since each pair of an addition followed by a removal cancels out, and the net effect is determined by the remaining moves).

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(n - 2 * m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version correctly determines if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves by checking if the difference adjusted for pairs of additions and removals results in an even number, which would mean it is possible to achieve the desired state.
