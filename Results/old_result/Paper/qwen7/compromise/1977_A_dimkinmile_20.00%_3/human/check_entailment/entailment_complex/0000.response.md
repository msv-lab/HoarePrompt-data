Reasoning:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
- It then iterates over each test case using a loop.
- Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1()`.
- The function `func_1()` correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
- It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
- The logic inside `func_1()` is correct according to the problem statement.
- The program structure ensures that all test cases are processed, and the correct output is produced for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
