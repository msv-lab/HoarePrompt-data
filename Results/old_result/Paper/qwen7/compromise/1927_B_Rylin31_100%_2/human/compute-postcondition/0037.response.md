Output State: **`ans` is an empty string '', `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an updated input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code `ans = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
