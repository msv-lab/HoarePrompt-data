Output State: **`ans` is a string composed of characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and splits them into a list using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `array` now contains the integers entered by the user, while the other variables (`ans`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
