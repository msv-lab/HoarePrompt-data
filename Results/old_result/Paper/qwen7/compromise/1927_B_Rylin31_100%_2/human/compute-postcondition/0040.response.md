Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'a', `j` is increased by 1, and the character at index `j-1` in `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the character at index `j` in the string `s` by 1. Since `ans` and `s` are assumed to be the same string initially, the last character of `ans` is 'a', which has an ASCII value of 97. Incrementing this character by 1 changes it to 'b' (ASCII value 98). The variable `j` is also increased by 1. Therefore, the last character of `ans` remains 'a', but the character at index `j-1` in `ans` (which was 'a') is now 'b'.
