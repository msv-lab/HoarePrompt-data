Output State: **`ans` is the string where the last character is `chr(s[j] + 97)`, `j` is incremented by 1, `s[j]` is increased by 1, and `array` must still contain elements**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a new character to the string `ans`. This character is determined by converting the value of `s[j] + 97` to a character using `chr()`. The variable `j` is incremented by 1, and the value of `s[j]` is increased by 1. The condition that `array` must still contain elements is preserved.
