Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in array:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97`
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0 except for `s[j]` which is now 1
   - `j` is the next element from the list `s` (i.e., `j+1`)

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` is the next element from the list `s` (i.e., `j+1`), the next value of `j` will be `j+1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to `j+1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to `s[j+1] + 97`, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0 except for `s[j+1]` which is now 1, `j` is `j+1`**.
