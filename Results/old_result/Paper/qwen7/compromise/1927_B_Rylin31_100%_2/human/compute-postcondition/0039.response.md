Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'a' (assuming `s[j]` is 97), `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans`. Here, `chr(97)` returns the character 'a'. The value of `s[j]` is assumed to be 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'. After appending 'a' to `ans`, the value of `j` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
