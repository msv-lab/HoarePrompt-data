Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'a' + the character corresponding to the value of `s[j]` + 97, and `array` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends to the string `ans` the character obtained by adding 97 to the value of `s[j]`. Since `s` is assumed to be a string (or list of characters), `s[j]` is a character, and adding 97 to its ASCII value gives another character. The `+=` operator adds this new character to the end of the string `ans`. The initial state of `array` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `ans` is the original value plus the new character.
