Output State: **`l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4; `s` is a list of `l` elements, each element being 0; `array` is a list of integers created from input split and mapped to integers; `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. No changes are made to the lists `s` and `array`, nor to the integer `l`. Therefore, the values of `l`, `s`, and `array` remain unchanged from their initial states.
