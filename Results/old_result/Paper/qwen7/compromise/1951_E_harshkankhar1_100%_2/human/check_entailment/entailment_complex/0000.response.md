Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires partitioning a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. The solution provided includes two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is used within `func_2` to check if a substring can be part of a valid partition.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the input string `s` and determines if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It handles three main cases:
     - Case 1: The entire string `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s) == False`). In this case, it prints "YES", `1`, and the string itself, indicating a valid partition.
     - Case 2: The first character of `s` is the same as the rest of the string up to the middle (`x == -1`). In this case, it prints "NO", indicating no valid partition.
     - Case 3: The first character of `s` is different from the rest of the string starting from index `x`. It further checks if the substring from `x+1` onwards is a palindrome. If not, it prints "YES", `2`, and the substrings split at index `x`. If the substring from `x+1` onwards is a palindrome and `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s` (rounded down), it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the substrings split at index `x+2`.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates over test cases using `for _ in range(int(input()))`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2()` which processes the input string and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions described.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The program handles all specified cases and outputs the correct results according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
