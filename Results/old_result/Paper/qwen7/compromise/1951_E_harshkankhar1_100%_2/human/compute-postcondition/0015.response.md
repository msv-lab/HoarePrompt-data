Postcondition: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, and `func_1(s)` returns `True`. The substring starting from index `x + 1` of `s` does not satisfy the condition `func_1`.**
