Output: **s (where s is the input string)**

Explanation:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`, but it is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `x` is initialized to `-1`.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is evaluated to `False`, but this function call does not affect the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement `print(s)` will simply print the input string `s`.
