Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character of the string.
- `func_1(s)` returns `True`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no other information about the content of `s` or the value of `x` is provided, we cannot determine the exact characters or their positions. However, the print statement itself does not depend on these details; it only prints the fixed string `'YES'`.
