Postcondition: `s` is an input string, `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, and `func_1(s)` returns `True`. If the substring starting from index `x + 1` of `s` does not satisfy the condition `func_1`, then no change occurs. If the substring `s[x + 1:]` contains at least one character that matches the first character of `s` and `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s` (rounded down), then no change occurs. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.
