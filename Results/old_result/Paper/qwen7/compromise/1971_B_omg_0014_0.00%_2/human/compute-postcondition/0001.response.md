State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

### Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because the `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, so it should be set to 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (which is not relevant to the loop's execution), `i` to 0, and `n` to be greater than 0.
