You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an input integer, each iteration of the loop checks if the input string has a set length of 2 characters. If true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then checks if the sorted string (in ascending order) is equal to the original string. If true, it prints the sorted string in descending order; otherwise, it prints the sorted string in ascending order. This process repeats for n iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the unique characters in `s` form exactly two distinct characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then either the lexicographically sorted version of `s` in descending order or the ascending order, depending on which matches the original string `s`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Set Analysis**: For each test case, the function converts the string `s` into a set `a` to check the unique characters. This is a good approach to identify if there are exactly two unique characters.
3. **Condition Check**: If the set `a` has exactly two unique characters, the function prints 'NO', which is correct because rearranging a string with only two unique characters cannot produce a different string.
4. **Generating Different String `r`**:
   - If the set `a` does not have exactly two unique characters, the function prints 'YES'.
   - It then sorts the string `s` both in ascending and descending order.
   - If the sorted string in ascending order (`b`) is the same as the original string `s`, it means the original string was already sorted in ascending order. In this case, it prints the string sorted in descending order (`c`).
   - Otherwise, it prints the string sorted in ascending order (`b`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the string has only two unique characters correctly by printing 'NO'.
   - For other cases, it generates a different string by sorting the characters in either ascending or descending order, ensuring the new string is different from the original.

6. **Output Format**: The function follows the required output format, printing 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the new string `r`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a different string `r` if possible, and prints 'NO' when it's not possible. The solution is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
