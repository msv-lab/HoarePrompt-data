Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to sum the digits of each number from 0 to `n-1` for each test case, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks to replace each integer from 1 to `n` with the sum of its digits and then compute the sum of these new values.

Here is an example where the program fails:

For `n = 12`, the correct output should be 51, as explained in the example. However, the given program will attempt to sum the digits of numbers from 0 to 11, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should iterate through the numbers from 1 to `n` and replace each number with the sum of its digits, then sum these values. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    soma = sum(func_1(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
    print(soma)
```

This corrected program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.
