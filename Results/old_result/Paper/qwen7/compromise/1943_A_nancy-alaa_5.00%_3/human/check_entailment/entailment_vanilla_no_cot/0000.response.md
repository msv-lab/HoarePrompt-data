Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. The program attempts to find the smallest missing integer in the array `arr` rather than simulating the game where Alice and Bob take turns according to the rules specified. Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. Alice can pick any element from `arr`, append it to her array `c`, and then remove it from `arr`. Bob can only pick and remove elements from `arr`.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The program tries to find the smallest missing integer in `arr` using a counter, which is not equivalent to calculating the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

3. **Turns Handling**: The program does not handle the turns alternately between Alice and Bob as required by the game rules.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game properly, keeping track of whose turn it is and ensuring that Alice and Bob make optimal moves according to their strategies. Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def mex_of_array(arr):
    mex = 0
    seen = set(arr)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def optimal_game_score():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice always picks the smallest available number first
        # Bob will try to minimize the MEX, so he will pick the smallest number that is not in c
        c = []
        for _ in range(n):
            if len(c) % 2 == 0:
                # Alice's turn
                if arr:
                    c.append(min(arr))
                    arr.remove(min(arr))
            else:
                # Bob's turn
                if arr:
                    # Bob will pick the smallest number not in c
                    mex = mex_of_array(c)
                    for num in sorted(arr):
                        if num >= mex:
                            c.append(num)
                            arr.remove(num)
                            break
        
        # Calculate the MEX of the final array c
        print(mex_of_array(c))

optimal_game_score()
```

This solution correctly simulates the game and calculates the MEX of the final array `c` after both players have made their optimal moves.
