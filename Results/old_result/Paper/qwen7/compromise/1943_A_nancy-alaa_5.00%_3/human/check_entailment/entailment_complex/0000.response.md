Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the objective of finding the MEX of the array `c`. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Rules Implementation**:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it, without appending it to `c`.

2. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.

3. **Current Program Logic**:
   - The current program attempts to find the smallest integer `i` that either does not appear in the list `arr` or appears exactly once after the first occurrence. This logic does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob, nor does it simulate the game process correctly.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX of `c` by picking elements that help her achieve a higher MEX value.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX of `c` by picking elements strategically.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX of `c` based on the optimal moves of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
