Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` or the last key in `mpp`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by mapping each element of the input (split by spaces) to an integer using the `map` function. The values of `first` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
