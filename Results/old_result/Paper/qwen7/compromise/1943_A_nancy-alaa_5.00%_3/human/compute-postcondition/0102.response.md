Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is less than `n`, where `n` is an integer equal to the input integer.
- `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, where `mpp` is presumably a dictionary.

The print statement is simply printing the value of `i`.

Since `i` is less than `n` and `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we know that `i` is an integer, but its exact value is not specified beyond these conditions. Therefore, the output will be the value of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is an integer less than n and not a key in mpp)**
