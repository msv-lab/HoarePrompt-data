Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `mpp` and `mpp[i] == 1`, regardless of the value of `first`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
