Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `first` to `True`. Since `first` was previously a boolean and now explicitly set to `True`, its value changes to `True`. However, the problem statement mentions that if `first` is `True` and certain conditions are met, we break out of the loop. But since no such conditions are present in the given code, and the code only sets `first` to `True`, `first` remains `True` in the context of the problem's postconditions. Given the postconditions, `first` should logically be `False` after this line of code, assuming it was `True` before. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
