Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list a contains n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` or the last key in `mpp`, and `n` is less than or equal to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer equal to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is now equal to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `first` is still either True or False depending on whether the condition `mpp[i] == 1` was met during any iteration, and `arr` and `mpp` remain unchanged from their initial states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
