Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1 or `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
