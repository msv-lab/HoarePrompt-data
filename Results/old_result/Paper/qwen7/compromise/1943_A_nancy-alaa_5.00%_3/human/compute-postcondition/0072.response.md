Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `i not in mpp.keys()` is false.
