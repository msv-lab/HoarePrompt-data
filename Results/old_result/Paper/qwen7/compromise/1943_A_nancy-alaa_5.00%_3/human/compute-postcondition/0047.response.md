Output State: **Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` or the last key in `mpp`, and `n` is less than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, it means that `i` has reached a value such that the condition `i not in mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i] != 1` is met, causing the loop to terminate. Since the loop breaks when it finds a key `i` where `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, or when `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, and given that `first` remains False throughout, the loop will continue until it either finds a key `i` where `mpp[i] == 1` (if such a key exists) or reaches the end of the range `n`. Therefore, `i` will be the last key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` or the last possible value of `i` in the range `range(n)`. Also, since the loop has completed all its iterations, `n` must be less than or equal to 2 because the loop would have broken earlier if `i` was not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i] == 1` before reaching the third iteration.
