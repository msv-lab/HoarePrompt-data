State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The initial value of `first` is False, but this variable is not part of the loop head.
3. For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range defined by `n`. Since `i` starts from 0 (the default starting point for `range(n)`), `n` must be greater than 0 to allow at least one iteration of the loop.
4. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `n` set to a value greater than 0.
