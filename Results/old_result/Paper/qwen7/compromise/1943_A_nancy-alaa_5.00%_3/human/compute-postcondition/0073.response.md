Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `i not in mpp.keys()` is not met.
