Output State: **`cur` is -1, `S` is an input integer, `M` contains keys whose values were initially set to 1 and were decremented until they became 0, `cnt` is a list containing all such keys repeated according to their occurrences in `M`, and `T` is decreased by 1; `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is assigned the value `-1`. The other variables (`S`, `M`, `cnt`, `T`, and `N`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
