Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in M.keys()`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` (which iterates over the keys of `M`) and `M`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` has the last element as `k`. If `M[k]` does not equal 1, there is no change in `cnt`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - The variable `k` will take on the next key from `M` in each iteration.
   - The variable `M` remains unchanged within the loop since it is not modified in the loop body based on the given information.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are keys left in `M` that have not been processed. Since `k` takes on the next key from `M`, the loop will continue until all keys have been processed.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The key `k` will change to the next key in `M`.
   - The postcondition ensures that if `M[k]` equals 1, the last element of `cnt` will be updated to `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.

Given that the loop is about to start its next iteration, the key `k` will be the next key in `M`. Therefore, `k` will be the next key in `M` after the current key.

Since `M` and `cnt` are not modified within the loop, their states remain the same.

**Final State**:
State: **`M` is an array, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` has the last element as `k`. There is no change in `cnt` if `M[k]` does not equal 1. `k` is the next key in `M` after the current key.**
