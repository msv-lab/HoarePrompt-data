Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a list element, and assigns this list to the variable `N`. The variables `T` and `S` remain unchanged from their initial state.
