Output State: **`cur` is the current value being tracked + 1, `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered, `num` is the next element in the list `N`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is part of a loop or conditional structure. After executing `break`, the loop or conditional block is exited, but the values of `cur`, `M[cur]`, and `num` remain unchanged.
