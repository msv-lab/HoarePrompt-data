Output State: **`N` is not empty, `cur` is greater than `num` minus one**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Given the initial condition that `num` is greater than `cur` plus one, after executing `cur += 1`, `cur` will now be greater than `num` minus one. The state of `N` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
