Output State: **`M` must have at least one key, `k` is the next key in `M`, `cnt` is a list containing the value of `k`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `k` is the next key in `M`, and `cnt` was previously unchanged, after executing this line, `cnt` will contain the value of `k`. All other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state.
