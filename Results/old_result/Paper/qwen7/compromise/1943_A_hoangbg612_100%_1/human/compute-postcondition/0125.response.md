Output State: **`S` is an input integer, `M` contains keys whose values were initially set to 1 and were decremented until they became 0, `cnt` is a list containing all such keys repeated according to their occurrences in `M`, and `T` is decreased by 1; `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The other variables (`S`, `M`, `cnt`, `T`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
