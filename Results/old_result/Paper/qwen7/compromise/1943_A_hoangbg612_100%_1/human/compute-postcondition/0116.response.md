Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `M` will contain keys that have a value of 1, and these keys will be added to the list `cnt`. For any key `k` in `M` where `M[k]` is greater than 1, `k` will not be added to `cnt`. The list `cnt` will contain all keys from `M` that had a value of 1 at any point during the loop's execution.

In simpler terms, `cnt` will include all keys from the dictionary `M` that had a value of 1 at any iteration of the loop, and no other keys will be included in `cnt`.
