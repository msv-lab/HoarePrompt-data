Output State: **`cnt` is an empty list, `cur` is the highest value present in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` appears in `N`, all other values in `M` will be zero or represent counts of numbers less than `cur` in `N`, the list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed. Additionally, if the sum of all values in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is increased by 1; otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and `M`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = []` initializes an empty list named `cnt`. This operation does not affect the values of `cur`, `M`, `N`, `T`, or `S`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains as described in the initial state, except that `cnt` is now an empty list.
