Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `M` will contain keys whose values were initially set to 1 and were decremented until they became 0. For each key `k` in `M` where `M[k]` was originally 1, `k` will be appended to `cnt` once for each iteration of the loop that `M[k]` is 1. `cnt` will be a list containing all such keys repeated according to their occurrences in `M`. All other keys in `M` will have their counts decremented to 0 after processing. The length of `cnt` is now greater than or equal to 2.**
