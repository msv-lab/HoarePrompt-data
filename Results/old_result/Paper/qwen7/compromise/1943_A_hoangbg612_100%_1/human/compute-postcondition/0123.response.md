Output State: **`S` is an input integer, `M` contains keys whose values were initially set to 1 and were decremented until they became 0, `cnt` is a list containing all such keys repeated according to their occurrences in `M`, and `T` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `S = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `S`. It does not affect the values of `M`, `cnt`, or `T`. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged except that `T` is decreased by 1 due to the loop condition in the initial state.
