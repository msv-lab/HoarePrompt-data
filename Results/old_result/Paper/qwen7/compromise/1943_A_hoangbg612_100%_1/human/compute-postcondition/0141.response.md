Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `num` is the next element in the list `N`, `cur` is the value of `cur` incremented by 1, and `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
