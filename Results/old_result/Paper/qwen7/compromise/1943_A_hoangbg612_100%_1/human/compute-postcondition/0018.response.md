Output State: **`cur` is -1, `M`[-1] is 1, `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary except for `M[-1]` which is 1, `num` is less than or equal to -1**.

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Given that `cur` is -1, `M[-1]` is incremented by 1. Since `M` was initially an empty dictionary, after executing this line, `M` contains the key `-1` with the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
