Output State: **`cur` is num, `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `num` has been encountered.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The value of `M[cur]` (which was previously the count of how many times `cur + 1` was encountered) now reflects the count of how many times `num` has been encountered. The condition to break out of the loop or if statement (`if num > cur + 1`) is not relevant here since the assignment directly updates `cur` without checking this condition.
