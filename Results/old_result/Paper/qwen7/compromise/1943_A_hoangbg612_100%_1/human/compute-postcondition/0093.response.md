Output State: **`N` is not empty, `cur` is the element after the next element in `N`, and `M[cur]` remains 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `N`, `cur`, or `M[cur]`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
