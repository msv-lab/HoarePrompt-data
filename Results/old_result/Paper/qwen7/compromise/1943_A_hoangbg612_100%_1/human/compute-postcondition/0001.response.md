State: **T must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, _ is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The condition for the loop to execute is determined by the value of `T`. Since `T` is given as a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, this value does not need to be adjusted as long as it meets the given constraints.
- Therefore, the only state that needs to be explicitly mentioned is that `_` starts at 0, and `T` must be a positive integer within the specified range.
