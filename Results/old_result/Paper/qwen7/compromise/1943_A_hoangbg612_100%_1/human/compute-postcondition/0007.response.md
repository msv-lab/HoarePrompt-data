Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `num` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `N` is a list of sorted integers.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `N`.
   - The first element of `N` will be assigned to `num` in the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` will take on the values from `N`, we don't need to adjust its initial value directly. Instead, we need to ensure that `N` has at least one element.
   - `T` and `S` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - `M` being an empty dictionary is also not relevant to the loop's execution.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `N` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is -1, `T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` must have at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary**
