You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are given, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1.

    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:

    #State: Output State: `t` is set to 1, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list resulting from the loop's conditions, `x` is an integer indicating the position where a condition was met or the last index of the string, `y` is an integer indicating the position where another condition was met or -1 if no condition was met.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `y` to `x`. If the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to `x-1` matches the substring of `s` from index `i+1` to `x`, then `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks. Since the problem does not provide specific values for `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y`, we can only say that `t` will be set to `x - i + 1` if the condition is met at least once during the loop. Otherwise, `t` remains 1. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop, which they are not in this case.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the list resulting from the loop's conditions)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it fails:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection Logic**: The program attempts to find a specific pattern to form the smallest string but does not handle all possible cases. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   2
   001
   110
   ```
   The program will incorrectly produce `00110` instead of `00010`. This is because the program does not correctly handle the scenario where both rows have a `1` at the same position, leading to an incorrect path selection.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not properly handle the case where both rows have `1`s at the same positions, which could lead to multiple valid paths yielding the same lexicographically smallest string. For instance, in the example provided in the problem statement:
   ```
   8
   00100111
   11101101
   ```
   The program should output `001001101` and `4`, but it incorrectly outputs `001001101` and `1`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
