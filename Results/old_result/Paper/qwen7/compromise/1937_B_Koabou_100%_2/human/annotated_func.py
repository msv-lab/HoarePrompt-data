#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are given, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, `n` is an input integer.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list resulting from the loop's conditions, `x` is an integer indicating the position where a condition was met or the last index of the string, `y` is an integer indicating the position where another condition was met or -1 if no condition was met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is set to 1, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list resulting from the loop's conditions, `x` is an integer indicating the position where a condition was met or the last index of the string, `y` is an integer indicating the position where another condition was met or -1 if no condition was met.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `y` to `x`. If the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to `x-1` matches the substring of `s` from index `i+1` to `x`, then `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks. Since the problem does not provide specific values for `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y`, we can only say that `t` will be set to `x - i + 1` if the condition is met at least once during the loop. Otherwise, `t` remains 1. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop, which they are not in this case.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the list resulting from the loop's conditions)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2`. It identifies specific substrings and positions within these strings based on certain conditions. After processing, it prints a modified binary string `s` derived from the conditions and outputs the value `1`.
