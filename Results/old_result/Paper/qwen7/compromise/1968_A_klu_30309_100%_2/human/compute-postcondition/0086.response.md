Postcondition: `max_sum` is 3, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `best_y` is 2, `current_sum` is 2. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is set to 2, `x` remains at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `best_y` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
