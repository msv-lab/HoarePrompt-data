Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is either unchanged or set to `current_sum`, `best_y` is either unchanged or set to `y`, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`.
