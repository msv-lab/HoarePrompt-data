Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
   ```
   The variables involved in this loop are `y` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is 1 less than the length of `test_cases`.
   - `y` is initially 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `y` values starting from `x - 1` down to 1 (exclusive).

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `x - 1` must be greater than 0, meaning `x` must be at least 2.
   - `y` must be within the range specified by `range(x - 1, 0, -1)`, which means `y` should be between `x - 1` and 1 (exclusive).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is 1 less than the length of `test_cases`, and `y` is 1, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 2 for the loop to start.
   - Given `y` is 1, it falls within the range specified by `range(x - 1, 0, -1)` as long as `x` is at least 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `y`:

- `x` must be at least 2.
- `y` must be 1.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`max_sum` is 0, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is 1, and `results` now contains 1**.
