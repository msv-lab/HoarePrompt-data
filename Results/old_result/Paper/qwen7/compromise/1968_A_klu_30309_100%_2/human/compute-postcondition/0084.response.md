Output State: **`max_sum` is 2, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `best_y` is 1, `current_sum` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `best_y = y` assigns the current value of `y` (which is 1) to `best_y`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `best_y` is updated to 1, while `max_sum`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` retain their original values.
