Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `x`. The loop iterates over each element in the `test_cases` list.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_sum` remains 0
   - `x` remains 1 less than the length of `test_cases`
   - `y` is 1
   - `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`
   - `best_y` is `y`
   - `results` now contains `best_y`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `x` is less than the length of `test_cases`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was 1 less than the length of `test_cases`. For the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `best_y`, and `results`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `x` will be incremented by 1, so it will be equal to the length of `test_cases` minus 1.
   - `y` remains 1.
   - `gcd_val` remains the greatest common divisor of the updated `x` and `y`.
   - `current_sum` remains `gcd_val + y`.
   - `best_y` remains `y`.
   - `results` still contains `best_y`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`max_sum` remains 0, `x` is 1 less than the length of `test_cases`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, and `results` now contains `best_y`**.
