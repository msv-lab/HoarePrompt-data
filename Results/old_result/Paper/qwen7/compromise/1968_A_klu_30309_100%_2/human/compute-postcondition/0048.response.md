Output State: **`max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement it is inside. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
