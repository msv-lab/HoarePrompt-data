Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is equal to `y - 2`, `x` remains the same, `y` is `y - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y - 2`**.

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` assigns the current value of `y` to `best_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
