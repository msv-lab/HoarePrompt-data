Postcondition: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is equal to `y - 2`, `x` remains the same, `y` is `y - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y - 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
