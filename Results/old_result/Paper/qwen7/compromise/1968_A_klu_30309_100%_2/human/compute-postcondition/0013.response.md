Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `y` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than `0`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`.
   - `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`.
   - `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `y` is \(x - 1\).
   - `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `y` in reverse order, the next value of `y` will be `y - 1`.
   - `x` remains unchanged because it is not being modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `results` remains an empty list.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `max_sum` remains the same.
   - `best_y` remains the same.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `y` becomes `y - 1`.
   - `gcd_val` remains the same.
   - `current_sum` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is the same, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**.
