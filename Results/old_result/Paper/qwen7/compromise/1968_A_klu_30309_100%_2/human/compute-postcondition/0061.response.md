Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `x` is 1 less than the length of `test_cases`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, and `results` now contains `best_y`**.

Explanation: The line `max_sum = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `max_sum`. None of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `best_y`, and `results`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
