Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1`. Let's verify the correctness step-by-step:

1. **Function Input and Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of integers).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each `x` in `test_cases`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible `y` values from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`.
   - It computes the current sum `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`.
   - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` to `current_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`. The loop breaks early since we only need the first `y` that gives the maximum sum.

3. **Result Collection**:
   - After determining the optimal `y` for each `x`, it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

4. **Output**:
   - The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1`, and prints the results.

Given the problem statement, the function should indeed find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x`. The provided code correctly implements this logic.

However, the provided state comment at the end of the function is incorrect. The state comment suggests that the function always returns `[1, 1, 1]`, which is not true. The function will return a list of values, where each value is the optimal `y` for the corresponding `x` in `test_cases`.

Therefore, the function logic is correct, but the state comment is misleading. The function does not always return `[1, 1, 1]`.

Correctness: **False**
