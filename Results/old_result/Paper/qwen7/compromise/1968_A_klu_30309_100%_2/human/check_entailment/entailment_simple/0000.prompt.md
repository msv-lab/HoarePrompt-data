Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

# Annotated Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is now a list containing the values `[1, 1, 1]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is 3, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, and `best_y` is 1 after the loop has executed all iterations.
    #
    #This means that for each `x` in `test_cases`, the loop has determined that the value of `y` which maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is 1, and the maximum sum found was 3. The loop has iterated through all elements in `test_cases`, and `results` now contains the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`.
    return results
    #`results` is a list containing the values [1, 1, 1]
