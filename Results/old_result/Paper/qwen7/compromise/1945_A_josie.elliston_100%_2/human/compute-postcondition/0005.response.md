Postcondition: `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers. If the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, the function calculates the minimum number of tents required. Otherwise, the function returns None.
