Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal)

According to the problem description:
- 1 introvert requires 1 tent.
- 4 extroverts need to be paired, but since there is only 1 universal, this is impossible because 3 extroverts cannot find a third person to share a tent with.

The program should return `-1` for this case, but it does not handle this scenario correctly. Here's a breakdown of why the current implementation fails:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts modulo 3 is not zero.
   - If `extroverts % 3` is not zero, it checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals` is less than 3. If so, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to pair all extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses `func_1` to calculate the total number of tents needed.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.

However, `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. For the input `1 4 1`, `func_1` would incorrectly return a value instead of `-1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the specific case where the number of extroverts exceeds the available pairs.
