Reasoning:
1. Let's analyze the logic of `func_1`:
   - The function checks if the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it calculates the minimum number of tents required using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
   - If either condition is not met, it returns `None`.

2. Now, let's look at `func_2`:
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
   - If `func_1` returns a value other than `None`, it adds the result to `introverts` and returns this sum.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it directly returns `-1`.

3. Given the problem statement:
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone, so `introverts` tents are needed for them.
   - Extroverts need to be in groups of 3, and `func_1` handles this part correctly.
   - Universals can be placed in any group configuration, so they do not affect the calculation directly but are used in `func_1` to determine if the extroverts can be grouped properly.

4. The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem requirements:
   - It correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It ensures that introverts get individual tents.
   - It returns `-1` if it's impossible to group the extroverts and universals as required.

5. The provided examples in the problem statement also confirm that the functions work as expected.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summaries.

Correctness: **True**
