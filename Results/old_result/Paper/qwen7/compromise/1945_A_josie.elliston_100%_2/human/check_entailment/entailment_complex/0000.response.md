Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly handles the accommodation of extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it is not, it further checks if the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is at least 3. If these conditions are met, it calculates the minimum number of tents required using the ceiling of the division of `(extroverts + universals)` by 3.
   - If the conditions are not met, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals under the specified conditions.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly integrates the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and adds the result to the number of introverts.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid number of tents, it adds the number of introverts to this value and returns the result.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The main loop iterates over each test case, calling `func_2` with the appropriate arguments.
   - The program correctly processes each test case and outputs the result as expected.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants based on their preferences. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
