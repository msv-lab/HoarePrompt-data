You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array and a sorted list of integers, then calls another function `func_1` to compute some result based on these inputs. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies internal variables like `index`, `t`, `p`, and `results` to manage the data across test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Prefix Sums**: The `func_1` function uses dynamic programming to simulate the generation of prefix sums, but it does not correctly handle the transitions between 1 and -1 values. The transitions should reflect the changes in the prefix sums based on the values in `a`, but the current implementation does not properly account for these changes.

2. **Offset Handling**: The offset handling in `func_1` is not appropriate for the problem. The offset is used to shift the indices, but the logic for updating the DP table does not correctly reflect the transitions between 1 and -1 values in the array `a`.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum calculation in `func_1` assumes that the last element of `p` directly corresponds to the final position in the DP table, which is not necessarily true without proper simulation of the prefix sums.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  3
  -1 0 0
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  2
  ```

  The two possible arrays `a` that can result in the sorted prefix sum array `p = [-1, 0, 0]` are `[1, -1, 1]` and `[-1, 1, 1]`. However, the provided program does not produce the correct result for this case.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, hence the correctness is **False**.
