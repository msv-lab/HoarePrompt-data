Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp` will be equal to `new_dp`, `i` will be 4, and `new_dp` will have been updated based on the values of `dp` according to the given rules.**

Explanation: The code `dp = new_dp` updates the value of `dp` to be the same as `new_dp`. The variable `i` is incremented to 4 as per the initial state description. The value of `new_dp` is updated based on the values of `dp` according to the given rules, which are not explicitly defined in the snippet but are mentioned to be part of the initial state.
