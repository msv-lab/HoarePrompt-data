Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp` will be equal to `new_dp`, `i` will be incremented to 4 (since it starts at 3 and increments by 1 each iteration), and `new_dp` will have been updated based on the values of `dp` according to the given rules.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `new_dp` list will reflect the cumulative sums of `dp[j]` values, adjusted by the modulo operation (`% MOD`). Specifically, for each index `j` where `dp[j] > 0`, the values of `new_dp[j-1]` and `new_dp[j+1]` will be incremented by `dp[j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. The process continues for all indices from 0 to `2*n` as defined by the loop's range. The variable `i` will be set to 4 since it starts at 3 and increments by 1 after each full iteration of the loop. The `dp` list will be updated to match the final state of `new_dp` after all iterations.
