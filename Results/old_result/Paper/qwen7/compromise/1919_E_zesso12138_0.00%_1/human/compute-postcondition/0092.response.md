Postcondition: `j` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `dp[j]` is greater than 0. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. If `j - 1` is less than 0, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
