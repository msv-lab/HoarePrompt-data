You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        dp = new_dp
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length \(2n + 1\) where each element is calculated based on the cumulative sum of its adjacent elements from the previous iteration, modulo `MOD`. Specifically, for each valid index \(j\) (0 to \(2n\)), the value of `dp[j]` will be the sum of `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j+1]` from the previous iteration, taken modulo `MOD`. After all iterations, `i` will be \(n + 1\), and `new_dp` will be assigned the final values of `dp`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` list will contain the values resulting from the specified update rule applied iteratively, starting from an initial condition where only `dp[n]` is 1 and all others are 0. The final `dp` list will reflect the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, wrapped around the list boundaries using modulo arithmetic.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp` at index `final_sum`, where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset` and `dp` reflects the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, taken modulo `MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and `p`, a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer's absolute value is less than or equal to `n`. It returns the value of `dp` at index `final_sum`, where `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, and `dp` represents the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, taken modulo `MOD`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `dp` at index `final_sum`, where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset` and `dp` reflects the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, taken modulo `MOD`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
