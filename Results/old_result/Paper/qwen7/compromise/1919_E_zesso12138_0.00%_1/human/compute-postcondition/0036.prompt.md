Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `index` is increased by the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations, `t` is 0 (since it decreases by 1 each iteration and starts from a value greater than 0), `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, appended with `result` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed segment of the `data` list, `t` will be 0 as it has been decremented to zero, `p` will contain all integers from the specified segments of `data` concatenated together, `data` remains unchanged, `results` will be a list of all the results returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for res in results:
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `index` is set to the initial value, `t` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` with one less element, `index` is set to the initial value, `t` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` with two less elements, `index` is set to the initial value, `t` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
