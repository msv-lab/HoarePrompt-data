Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length `2 * n + 1`, `j` is 0, `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0, so `new_dp[j + 1]` is equivalent to `new_dp[1]`. Since `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `dp[0]` is also the initial value of `new_dp[0]`. However, since `new_dp` is a list of 0s initially, `new_dp[0]` is 0. Therefore, `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(0 + dp[0]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp[0] % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
