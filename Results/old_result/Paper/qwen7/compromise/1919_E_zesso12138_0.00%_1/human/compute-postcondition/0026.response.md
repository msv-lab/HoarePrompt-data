Output State: **`index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[index]`, `t` is greater than 0, `p` is now a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, `results` now contains one additional element which is the latest `result`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the current `result` to the list `results`. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, the list `results` now contains one more element, which is the latest `result`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
