Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is still 2, and `n` remains at least 1; `new_dp` is a list of 0s with a length of `2 * n + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `dp = new_dp` simply assigns the value of `new_dp` to `dp`. This means that `dp` now holds the same list as `new_dp`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. `new_dp` is described as a list of 0s with a length of `2 * n + 1`, which means it is initialized with zeros and its length is determined by the value of `n`.
