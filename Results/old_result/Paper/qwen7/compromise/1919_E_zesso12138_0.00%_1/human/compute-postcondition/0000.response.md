Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `input = sys.stdin.read` has been assigned to the variable `input`.**

This line of code simply assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`, which does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`. It only changes what `input` refers to.
