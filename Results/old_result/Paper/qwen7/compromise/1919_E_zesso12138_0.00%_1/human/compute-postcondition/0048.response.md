Postcondition: `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length `2 * n + 1`, and if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. If `j + 1` is greater than `2 * n`, no changes are made to `new_dp`.
