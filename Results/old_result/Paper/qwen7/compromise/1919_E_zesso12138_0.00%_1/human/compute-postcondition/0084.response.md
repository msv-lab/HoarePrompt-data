Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `dp[j]` is greater than 0, and `j` plus 1 is less than or equal to 2 times `n`; `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**.

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to its current value and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. Since `j` is 0 initially, `j + 1` is 1. Therefore, `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
