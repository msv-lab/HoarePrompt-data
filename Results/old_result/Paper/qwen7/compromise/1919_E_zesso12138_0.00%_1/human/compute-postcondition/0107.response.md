Postcondition: `j` is the previous `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. If `j + 1` is greater than `2 * n`, no updates are made to `new_dp[j + 1]`. Additionally, if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
