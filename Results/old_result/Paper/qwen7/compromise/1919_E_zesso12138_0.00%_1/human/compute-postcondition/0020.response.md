Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is simply `_` (a placeholder variable) and the range object, which is controlled by the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the current state of `t`**: From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `t` is `t - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and `t` was `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `t` must be set to a value greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `index` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
- `p` and `data` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
- `results` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`index` is 5 + `data[index]` + `data[index]`, `n` is `data[index]`, `t` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + data[index] - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, and `results.append(result)` has been executed.**
