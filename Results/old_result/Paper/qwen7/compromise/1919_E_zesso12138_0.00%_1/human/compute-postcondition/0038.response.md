Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array and a sorted list of integers, then calls another function `func_1` to compute some result based on these inputs. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies internal variables like `index`, `t`, `p`, and `results` to manage the data across test cases.**
