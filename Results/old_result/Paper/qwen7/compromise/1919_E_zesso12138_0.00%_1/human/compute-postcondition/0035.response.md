Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` with two less elements.
- `index` is set to the initial value (which is not specified, but it doesn't affect the output of the print statement).
- `t` is 0.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.

The `print(res)` statement is trying to print a variable named `res`. However, there is no definition or initialization of `res` in the provided initial state. Therefore, `res` is not defined, and attempting to print it would result in a NameError unless `res` is defined elsewhere in the code that is not shown here.

Given the information, we cannot determine the value of `res` because it is not defined in the provided context.

Output: **NameError: name 'res' is not defined**
