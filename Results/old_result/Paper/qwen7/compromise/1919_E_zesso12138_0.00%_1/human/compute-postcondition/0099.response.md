Postcondition: **`j` is an integer and equals the previous `j + 1`. `n` is greater than 0. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `dp[j] > 0`, then either `j - 1` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, or `j + 1` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. This update is performed if `j + 1` is within the valid range.**
