Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` with one less element.
- `index` is set to the initial value (which is not specified, but it doesn't affect the output since we are only looking at the `res` variable).
- `t` is 0.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.

The `print(res)` statement is trying to print the last element of the `results` list because `results` is described as having one less element. Since no specific values are given for `results`, we can only refer to the last element of the list.

Output: **the last element of results**
