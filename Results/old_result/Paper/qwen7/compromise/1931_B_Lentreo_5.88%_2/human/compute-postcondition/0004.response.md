Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.**

The code assigns the last element of the list `nums` to the variable `last`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `nums` are still valid.
