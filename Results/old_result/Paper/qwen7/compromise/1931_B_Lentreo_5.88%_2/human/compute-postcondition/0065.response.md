Output State: **`nums` is a list with at least one element (excluding the first element of the previous iteration), `i` is the second element of the original `nums`, `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`.**

Explanation: The code `curr += i - last` updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to the current value of `curr`. Since `i` is the second element of the original `nums`, and the precondition states that `i` is either 0 or not 0, the value of `curr` is updated accordingly. The list `nums` and the variable `last` retain their previous values.
