Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in nums:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on each value from the list `nums` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `nums`: This is a list of integers.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `nums` must contain at least one element. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` will take on the values from `nums`, we don't need to adjust its initial state.
   - We need to ensure that `nums` contains at least one element.

Given the initial states:
- `curr` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input (we need to ensure this list has at least one element).
- `last` is the last element of the list `nums` (this is not relevant to the loop execution).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `nums` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums` must have at least one element**
