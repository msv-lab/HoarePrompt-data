Based on the initial state provided:

- `nums` is an empty list, so it contains no elements.
- `i` does not exist because the loop has completed, meaning that there were no iterations of the loop.
- `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the original `nums` list where each element is subtracted by the corresponding `last` value from the previous iteration. Since `nums` is empty, there are no elements to sum or subtract from.
- `curr` is not equal to 0, but this condition alone doesn't provide a specific value for `curr`.

Given these conditions, the print statement will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
