Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `curr` will be the sum of all non-zero elements in the list `nums`, each adjusted by subtracting the last element seen so far.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`. For each non-zero element `i`, it updates `curr` by adding `i - last`, where `last` is the last element processed in the previous iteration. This means that `curr` accumulates the difference between each non-zero element and the element that was processed immediately before it. After all iterations, `curr` will hold the final accumulated value based on this rule.
