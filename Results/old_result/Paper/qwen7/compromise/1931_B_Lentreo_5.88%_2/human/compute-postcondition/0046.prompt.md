Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `curr` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of `nums`
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the first element of `nums` and is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to the value of `curr + (i - last)`, and `nums` must still have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `curr` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between the current value of `i` and the last value of `i`. `i` is now the second element of `nums` and is not equal to 0. `nums` is the list without the first element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the third element of `nums`, `nums` is the list without the first two elements, `last` is the second element of the original `nums`, and `curr` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between the third element of `nums` and the second element of the original `nums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
