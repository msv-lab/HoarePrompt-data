Output State: **`curr` is updated to the value of `curr + (i - last)`, `i` is the first element of `nums` and is not equal to 0, `nums` must still have at least one element.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the current element `i` and the last element `last` to its current value. The initial conditions for `i` and `nums` remain unchanged.
