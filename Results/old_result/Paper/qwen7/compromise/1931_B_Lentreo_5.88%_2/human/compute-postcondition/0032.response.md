Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in nums:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the variable used to iterate over the elements of `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `nums` to iterate over.
   - The loop will stop when `i` (which represents the current element of `nums`) goes through all elements of `nums`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop requirements**:
   - Since `i` is used to iterate over `nums`, it should start from the first element of `nums`.
   - For the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `curr` is 0.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `last` is the last element of `nums`.

Given these points, the relevant states to adjust are `i` and `nums`. The other states (`curr`, `t`, `n`, and `last`) are not directly related to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `nums`, `nums` must have at least one element**.
