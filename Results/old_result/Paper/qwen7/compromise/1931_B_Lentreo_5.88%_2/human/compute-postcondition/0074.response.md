Output: **YES**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `nums` is an empty list. Since `nums` is empty, there are no elements to process, and therefore, the value of `curr` is 0, which is the sum of all non-zero elements in the original `nums` list (an empty list has no non-zero elements). The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES', and does not depend on the values of `nums` or `curr`.
