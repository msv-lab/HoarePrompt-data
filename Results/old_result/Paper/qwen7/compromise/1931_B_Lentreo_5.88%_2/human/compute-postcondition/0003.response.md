Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int using `map(int, ...)`, and then converts the map object to a list. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `nums` is created and assigned a list of integers based on the input.
