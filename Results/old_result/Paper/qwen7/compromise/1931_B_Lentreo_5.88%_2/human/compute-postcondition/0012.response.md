Output State: **`curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`, `i` is the next element in `nums`.**

This means that the current value of `curr` is now the sum of its previous value, the current element `i` from the list `nums`, and subtracting the last element `last`. The variable `i` remains as the next element in the list `nums`.
