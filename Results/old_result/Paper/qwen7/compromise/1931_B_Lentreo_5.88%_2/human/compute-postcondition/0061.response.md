Output State: **`curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`, `i` is the first element of `nums`, and the current value of `i` is not 0.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the current value of `i` and the previous value of `last` to its current value. The value of `i` remains the first element of `nums`, and it is not 0. The value of `last` is not specified in the initial state, so it is kept as `last`.
