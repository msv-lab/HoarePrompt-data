State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and `_` is now 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, but since it's being incremented within the loop, we can consider it as starting from 1 for the first iteration.
2. The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, so `t` must fall within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and `_` is now 1 (since the loop will start its first iteration).
