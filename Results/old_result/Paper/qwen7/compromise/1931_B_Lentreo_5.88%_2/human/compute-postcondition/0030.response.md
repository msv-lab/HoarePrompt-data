Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the last element of `nums` (`last`), if `curr` equals 0, it remains 0; otherwise, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the last element of `nums` (`last`), `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of the list `nums` to the variable `last`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
