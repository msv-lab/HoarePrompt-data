### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from one container to another.
- The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers \( n \).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
- The program iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the number of containers \( n \) and the amounts of water in each container.
- It calculates the difference between each element and the last element in the list and sums these differences.
- If the sum of these differences is zero, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program checks if the sum of the differences between each element and the last element is zero. This does not guarantee that the water can be evenly distributed among all containers.
2. **Example Test Case**: Consider the input:
   ```
   3
   5
   4 5 2 1 3
   ```
   - The program calculates the differences: \(4-3, 5-3, 2-3, 1-3, 3-3\) which results in \(1, 2, -1, -2, 0\).
   - Summing these differences gives \(1 + 2 - 1 - 2 + 0 = 0\), so the program prints "YES".
   - However, it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water (which should be 3 units each) using the allowed operations.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves checking if the average amount of water per container can be achieved by pouring water between containers.
- The average amount of water per container is given by the total amount of water divided by \( n \).
- We need to verify if it is possible to distribute the water such that each container has this average amount.

#### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water // n
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, we should maintain the original assessment.

**Final: False**
