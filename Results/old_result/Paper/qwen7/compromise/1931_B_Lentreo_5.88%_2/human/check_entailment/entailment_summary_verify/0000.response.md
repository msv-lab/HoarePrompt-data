### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another where the index of the source container is less than the index of the destination container.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**: The provided function summary describes the logic as calculating the sum of all non-zero elements in the list, each subtracted by its respective last element from the end of the list. This is not a valid approach to solve the problem.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers. This means the sum of the water in all containers should be divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If it is, then it is always possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by redistributing the water according to the given operation rules.

4. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation simply checks if the sum of differences between each element and the last element is zero. This is not a valid check for the problem. Instead, it should check if the total sum of water is divisible by `n`.

5. **Example Analysis**: Consider the example provided:
   ```
   3
   5
   4 5 2 1 3
   ```
   - The total sum of water is `4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 15`.
   - Since `15 % 5 == 0`, it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water (which is `15 / 5 = 3` units).

However, the current implementation does not perform this check. It only checks if the sum of differences is zero, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
