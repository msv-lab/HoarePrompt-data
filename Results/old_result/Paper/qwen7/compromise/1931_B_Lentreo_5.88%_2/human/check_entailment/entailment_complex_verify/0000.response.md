### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container has more water than the destination container.

#### Key Points:
1. **Initial Water Distribution**: The initial distribution of water in the containers is given.
2. **Operation Allowed**: Pour any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where \(i < j\).
3. **Objective**: Make the amount of water in all containers the same.

#### Correct Solution Approach:
To solve this problem, we need to check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers. This means that the total amount of water divided by the number of containers should result in an integer (i.e., the average amount of water per container).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the difference between each element and the last element in the list of water amounts. This is not a correct approach because:
- The code does not check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed.
- The code does not simulate the pouring operations to ensure that the water can indeed be redistributed to achieve the desired uniform distribution.

#### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of containers.
     - `nums`: List of water amounts in the containers.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `last`: The last element in the list `nums`.
   - `curr`: Sum of differences between each element and `last`.

3. **Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `nums` and adds the difference between the element and `last` to `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This logic is flawed because:
- It does not check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed.
- It does not simulate the pouring operations to ensure that the water can be redistributed.

#### Example Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
3
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
- Total water: \(4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 15\)
- Average water per container: \(15 / 5 = 3\)

The code will output "YES" because `curr` is zero, but it is not possible to make all containers have exactly 3 units of water using the allowed operations.

#### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve:
1. Calculating the total amount of water.
2. Checking if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers.
3. Simulating the pouring operations to ensure that the water can be redistributed to achieve the desired uniform distribution.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided code does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
