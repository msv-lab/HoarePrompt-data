Output State: **The program returns a list of strings containing the values of t, n, and x for each test case.**

Explanation:
- The code `return input().split()` reads input from the user.
- Since `t` represents the number of test cases, the first line of input will contain `t` as an integer.
- For each test case, the next line will contain two integers `n` and `x`.
- The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace.
- Therefore, the program returns a list of strings where each string contains the values of `t`, `n`, and `x` for each test case.
