### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly points out that the provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are indeed just placeholders for input operations and do not implement the required binary search algorithm or the logic to rearrange the permutation.

However, the problem description specifies that the input processing is handled by these functions, and the main logic for solving the problem should be implemented elsewhere. Given that the problem description mentions the use of these functions, we should assume that the actual logic for solving the problem is supposed to be implemented in some other part of the code that is not provided here.

Since the original assessment is based on the provided code and not on the assumed logic that might be present elsewhere, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it lacks the necessary logic to rearrange the permutation and perform the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the provided code, even though the actual logic might be implemented elsewhere. The original assessment is accurate in this context.
