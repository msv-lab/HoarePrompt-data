Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func()` does not handle multiple test cases. It only processes one test case and then stops, which is incorrect because the input specifies the number of test cases (`t`) at the beginning.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic to determine the minimum number of invitations is flawed. Specifically, the code checks if there exists a pair `(i, l[i])` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2`, assuming that just these two friends will come to the party. However, this logic does not cover all scenarios where more friends might come if additional invitations are sent.

3. **Output for Multiple Test Cases**: The function should process each test case separately and print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        # Create a set to keep track of friends who can come to the party
        can_come = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                can_come.add(i + 1)
                can_come.add(l[i])
        
        # If at least 2 friends can come, print 2
        if len(can_come) >= 2:
            results.append(2)
        else:
            # Otherwise, we need to invite at least 3 friends
            results.append(3)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function
func()
```

This corrected version handles multiple test cases, correctly identifies pairs of friends who can come to the party, and prints the minimum number of invitations required for each test case.
