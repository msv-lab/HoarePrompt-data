Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a list of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list p of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct). For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and returns output based on these parameters without accepting any parameters itself.
