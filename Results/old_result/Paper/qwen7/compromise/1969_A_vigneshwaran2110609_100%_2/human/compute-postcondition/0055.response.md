Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers. If the element at index `i` in list `l` points to an index in `l` such that the element at that index is equal to `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged.
