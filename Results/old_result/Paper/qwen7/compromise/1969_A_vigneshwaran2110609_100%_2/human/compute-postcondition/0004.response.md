Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially 0, the loop will execute if `x > 0`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` (to ensure it is greater than 0) and `i` (which is already 0).

Here is the final state:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.
