Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` because `range(N + 1)` generates values from 0 to N.

3. **Determine the Requirement for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `N`. Therefore, `N` must be a non-negative integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `N` must be a non-negative integer, and since `N` is an integer input from stdin, it should be within the range specified (0 <= N).

Given the initial states:
- `s` is 0
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive
- `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5
- `arr` is an empty list
- `N` is an integer input from stdin
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers
- `e` is 0
- `num` is the first element of `nums`
- `nums` is now `[num, -1]`

We need to adjust the states of `i` and `N` for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `N` is an integer input from stdin that must be a non-negative integer**
