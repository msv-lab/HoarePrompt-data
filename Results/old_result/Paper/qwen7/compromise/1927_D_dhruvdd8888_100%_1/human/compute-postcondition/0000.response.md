Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n; `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply reassigns the variable `input` to refer to the function `sys.stdin.readline`. This does not change the values of any variables or lists but updates which function `input` refers to. All other variables remain in their initial states.
