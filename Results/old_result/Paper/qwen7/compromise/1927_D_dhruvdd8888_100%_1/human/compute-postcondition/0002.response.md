Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n; `N` is an integer input from stdin; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.**

The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input, splits the line into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `N` remain unchanged.
