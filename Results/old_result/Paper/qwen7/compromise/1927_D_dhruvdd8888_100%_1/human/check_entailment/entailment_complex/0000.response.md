### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given subarray \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). If no such pair exists, return \((-1, -1)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and several queries.
   - For each test case, it constructs an auxiliary array `arr` that records the positions where the value of the original array changes.
   - It then processes each query using binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that corresponds to the query range \([l, r]\).
   - Based on the positions found, it determines whether a valid pair \((i, j)\) can be found within the query range.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The construction of `arr` ensures that we have the boundaries where the values change in the original array.
   - The use of binary search helps efficiently find the relevant segment for each query.
   - The logic for determining the output (valid pair or \((-1, -1)\)) seems correct based on the conditions provided.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when the start index `s` is greater than `l` or when the end index `e` is less than `r`.
   - It correctly identifies when no valid pair exists and returns \((-1, -1)\).

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, providing pairs of indices or \((-1, -1)\) for each query.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
