### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to ensure its correctness according to the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`).

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The code creates a list `arr` which stores intervals where the array elements change. This helps in quickly finding the first and last occurrence of each unique element within any subarray.
   - The preprocessing step ensures that we can efficiently handle the queries by using binary search.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the code uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the interval in `arr` that corresponds to the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Based on the position found, the code determines whether there are two distinct elements within the queried range.
   - If such elements exist, it prints their indices; otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the start or end of the interval might be out of bounds or when no distinct elements are found within the queried range.

Given the detailed analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It preprocesses the array to identify intervals where elements change and then uses this information to efficiently answer each query.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
