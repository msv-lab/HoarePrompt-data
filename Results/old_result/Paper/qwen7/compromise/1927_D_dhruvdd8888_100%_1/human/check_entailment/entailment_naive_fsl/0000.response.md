Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same. Specifically, in the `func_1` function, when the queried subarray consists of identical elements, the program fails to find a pair of different elements, leading to incorrect output. For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

The expected output would be `-1 -1`, but the program will incorrectly output a valid pair of indices since it does not properly handle the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same.
