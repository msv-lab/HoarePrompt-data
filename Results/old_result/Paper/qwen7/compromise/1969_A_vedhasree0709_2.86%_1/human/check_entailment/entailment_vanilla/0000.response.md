### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `l` representing each friend's best friend.
   - The code uses a while loop to check pairs of friends `(i, i+1)` to see if they form a valid pair where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is incorrect. This condition checks if the current friend `i` is the best friend of `i+1` and vice versa, but it does not correctly represent the problem's requirements.
   - The logic only checks for a specific pair pattern `(i, i+1)` and does not consider all possible pairs of friends.
   - The code does not handle cases where the best friends form cycles or other patterns that need more than 2 invitations.

4. **Examples from the Problem Statement**:
   - In the first example, the correct answer should be `2` (inviting friends 4 and 5), but the code might fail to recognize this.
   - In the second example, the correct answer is `3`, but the code incorrectly prints `2`.
   - In the third example, the correct answer is `2`, but the code incorrectly prints `3`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to account for all possible scenarios and does not find the minimum number of invitations required in some cases.

**Correctness: False**
