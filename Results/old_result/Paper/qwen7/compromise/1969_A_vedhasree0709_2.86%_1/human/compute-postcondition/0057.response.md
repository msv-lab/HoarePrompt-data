Output State: **`j` is 1**

The code `j = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `j`. No other variables are affected, so the initial state of `i` needing to satisfy the loop condition `i <= n - 1` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is still required to be greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue with `i` starting from 2. However, since no changes were made to `n`, the precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid. The only new information is that `j` is now 1.
