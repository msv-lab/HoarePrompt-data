Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2

3. **Determine the conditions under which the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= n - 1` must be true.
   - Given `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - Since `i` is already 3, it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `n` must be adjusted to ensure the loop condition is met.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
