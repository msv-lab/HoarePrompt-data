Output State: `i` is 5, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times and `i` is now 4 after the third iteration, it will continue to increment `i` in the next iterations. Since no further conditions in the loop body change `i` beyond the increment operation, `i` will reach `n` (which is at least 1) and then the loop will terminate. The variable `j` remains 1 because the condition to change its value to 1 was met during the first iteration, and there's no further condition to change it afterward. The list `l` remains unchanged as no operations modify it within the loop.
