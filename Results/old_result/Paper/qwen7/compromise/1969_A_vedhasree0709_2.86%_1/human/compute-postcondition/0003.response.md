Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The variable `i` is initialized to 0, but no changes are made to `n` or `l`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
