Postcondition: `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. If `l[i]` (which is `l[0]`) equals 2 and `l[i + 1]` (which is `l[1]`) equals 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `j`, or `l`.
