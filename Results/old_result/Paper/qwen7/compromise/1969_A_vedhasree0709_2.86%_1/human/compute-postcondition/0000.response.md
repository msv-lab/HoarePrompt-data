Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is a placeholder typically used when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body. However, the loop itself depends on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. This means the state before the loop must include the condition that the input is valid and non-zero.

3. **State Before the Loop**: We know from the problem statement that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer. Since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to run even once.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `t` is a positive integer (which it already is, given its range).

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
