Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is [2]
- `ans` is 3

The loop continues to execute as long as `cnt` has more than one element. In this case, `cnt` starts as [2], which has only one element, so it does not meet the condition to enter the loop. Therefore, the loop does not run at all.

Since the loop does not run, the value of `ans` remains 3.

Output: **3**
