Output State: **`cnt` is [1, 2, 0]; `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the maximum of 0 and `x - 1` to `ans`. Since `x` can be one of the values 1, 2, or 0, let's consider each case:

- If `x` is 1, then `max(0, x - 1)` is `max(0, 1 - 1)`, which is 0. So, `ans` remains unchanged.
- If `x` is 2, then `max(0, x - 1)` is `max(0, 2 - 1)`, which is 1. So, `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`.
- If `x` is 0, then `max(0, x - 1)` is `max(0, 0 - 1)`, which is 0. So, `ans` remains unchanged.

Since `ans` is initially 0 (implied from the context), and considering the possible values of `x`, the only way `ans` changes is when `x` is 2, making `ans` equal to 1. The list `cnt` remains unchanged.
