Output State: `cnt` is [2], `ans` is 3.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `cnt` will consist of a single element, which is 2, because each element in `cnt` was decremented by 1 in each iteration until only one positive element remained. The variable `ans` will be 3, as it increments by 1 for each iteration of the loop, and the loop executed 3 times before stopping.
