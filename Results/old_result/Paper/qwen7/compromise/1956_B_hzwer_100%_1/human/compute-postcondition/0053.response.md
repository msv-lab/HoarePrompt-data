Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cnt` is `[0, 0, 0]`.
   - `ans` is `8`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `a` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The list `a` must contain at least one integer for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `x` will take on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration of the loop.

Given this information, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a`. Specifically, `a` must contain at least one integer.

**Final State**:
State: **`cnt` is [0, 0, 0], `ans` is 8, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer**
