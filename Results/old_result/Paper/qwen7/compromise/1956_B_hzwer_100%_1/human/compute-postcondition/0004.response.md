Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the number of integers input from `sys.stdin.readline`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.readline` and splits it into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list `a` contains `n` integers, where `n` is the number of integers in the input line. The values of `t` and the original `input` function remain unchanged.
