Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element.
  - `cnt[a[x]]` is incremented by 1.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for x in a:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.
   - Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Next Iteration Conditions:**
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still be a list with at least one element.
   - The variable `x` will take the next element from the list `a` in the next iteration.

3. **Update the State:**
   - Since `x` is iterating through the list `a`, in the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
- The state needs to be updated such that `a` still has at least one element, and `x` takes the next value from the list `a`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**
