Output State: **`ans` is 0 + max(0, `x` - 1) + max(0, `x` - 1), `cnt` must have at least one element**

Explanation: The initial state of `ans` is given as \(0 + \max(0, x - 1)\). The code snippet `ans += max(0, x - 1)` adds the value of \(\max(0, x - 1)\) to the current value of `ans`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` becomes \(0 + \max(0, x - 1) + \max(0, x - 1)\). The variable `cnt` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
