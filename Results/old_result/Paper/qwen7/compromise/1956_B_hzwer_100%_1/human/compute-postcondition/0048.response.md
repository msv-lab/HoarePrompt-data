To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `cnt` is a list of integers.
   - For each element `x` in `cnt` (except the first one), decrement `x` by 1.
   - After all elements (except the first one) have been decremented, remove any non-positive elements from `cnt`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in the modified `cnt`.

2. **Decrement Process**:
   - Each element in `cnt` (except the first one) is decremented by 1.
   - Any resulting non-positive elements are removed from `cnt`.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - For each remaining element `x` in the modified `cnt`, calculate `max(0, x - 1)`.
   - Sum these values to get `ans`.

Given this process, the final `ans` will be the sum of the positive decremented values of all elements in `cnt` (excluding the first element), and `cnt` will contain only the positive decremented values of its original elements.

Since the exact initial values of `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the positive decremented values of all elements in cnt, excluding the first element, and cnt contains only the positive decremented values of its original elements)**
