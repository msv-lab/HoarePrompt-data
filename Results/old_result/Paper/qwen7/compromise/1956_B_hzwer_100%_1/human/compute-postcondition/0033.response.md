Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `a` contains at least one element.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, meaning `x` was an element of `a` in the previous iteration.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - Since `x` was an element of `a` in the previous iteration, `a` now has one less element (assuming `x` was removed or no longer considered in the current context).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` still has at least one element, but it has lost one element since the last iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must have at least one element, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1**
