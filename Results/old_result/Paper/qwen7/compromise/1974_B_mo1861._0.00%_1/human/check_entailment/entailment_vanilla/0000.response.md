Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires decoding a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters from `s` sorted alphabetically, and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to decode the string `b`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique set of `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in `b`.
   - The mapping is done by calculating the position of each character in the sorted unique set and assigning it the corresponding symmetric character.
   - Finally, the function constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly identifies the unique characters in `b` and sorts them.
   - It maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in `b`, ensuring the correct decoding.
   - The implementation handles all test cases as per the problem statement, including edge cases like single-character strings.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly decodes the string `b` to restore the original string `s`.

Correctness: **True**
