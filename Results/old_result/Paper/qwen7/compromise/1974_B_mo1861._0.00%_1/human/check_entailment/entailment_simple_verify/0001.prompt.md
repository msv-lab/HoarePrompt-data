You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires decoding a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters from `s` sorted alphabetically, and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to decode the string `b`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique set of `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in `b`.
   - The mapping is done by calculating the position of each character in the sorted unique set and assigning it the corresponding symmetric character.
   - Finally, the function constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly identifies the unique characters in `b` and sorts them.
   - It maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in `b`, ensuring the correct decoding.
   - The implementation handles all test cases as per the problem statement, including edge cases like single-character strings.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly decodes the string `b` to restore the original string `s`.

Correctness: **True**
