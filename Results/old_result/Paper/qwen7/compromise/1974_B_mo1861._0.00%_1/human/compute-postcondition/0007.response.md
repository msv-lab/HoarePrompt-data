Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the string `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`. The keys in the dictionary are the unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically, and the values are characters from 'z' down to 'a' corresponding to the position of each character in the reversed sorted order of unique characters in `b`; `s` is a string that is the result of replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`.
