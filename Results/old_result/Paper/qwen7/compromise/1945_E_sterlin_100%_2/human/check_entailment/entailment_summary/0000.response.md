Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation such that the element `x` is at index `l` after performing a binary search. This can be done by making at most 2 swaps.
2. **Execution Summaries**:
   - `func_1()`: Returns the number of test cases (`t`).
   - `func_2()`: Returns a tuple `(n, x)` where `n` is the length of the permutation and `x` is the target value.
   - `func_3()`: Returns a list `p` representing the permutation.
   - `func_4()` and `func_5()`: These functions are not used in the provided code and thus do not affect the correctness of the solution.
3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the input and initializes necessary variables.
   - It performs a binary search on the permutation `p` to find the position of `x`.
   - Depending on the result of the binary search, it either prints `0`, `1`, or `2` operations needed.
   - The logic for determining the swaps is correct:
     - If `x` is already at the correct position (`left`), it prints `0`.
     - If `x` is not present in the seen positions, it performs one swap to bring `x` to the correct position.
     - If `x` is not present and a swap is needed, it finds the correct positions to swap and prints them.

Given the execution summaries and the code analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
