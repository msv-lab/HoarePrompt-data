### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided annotated code and compare it with the problem description and the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly uses the utility functions to read the input values for `t`, `n`, `x`, and the permutation `p`.

2. **Permutation Handling:**
   - The code creates a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index.
   - It also initializes a `seen` list to keep track of which elements have been visited during the binary search.

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search is implemented correctly. It uses the `left` and `right` pointers to narrow down the search range until `left + 1` equals `right`.
   - During the search, it updates the `seen` list to mark elements that are less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Swapping Elements:**
   - If `p[left]` is not equal to `x`, the code checks if `x` has been seen yet. If not, it performs one swap to bring `x` into the search range.
   - If `x` is still not found after the first swap, it performs a second swap to ensure `p[left]` is `x`.

5. **Output:**
   - The code correctly outputs the number of swaps performed and the indices of the swapped elements.

Given the above analysis, the annotated code does indeed implement the required functionality:
- It reads the necessary inputs.
- It rearranges the permutation using at most 2 swaps.
- It performs the binary search to find the index of `x` in the rearranged permutation.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is inaccurate. The provided code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
