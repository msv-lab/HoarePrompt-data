Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n; `n` is the length of the `array`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(array)` calculates the length of the list `array` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `array` being a permutation of size n remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated value of `n` and the unchanged state of `array`.
