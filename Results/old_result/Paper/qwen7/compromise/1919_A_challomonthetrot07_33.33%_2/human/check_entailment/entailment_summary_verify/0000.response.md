### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description and Constraints
- Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 coin from their respective wallets.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- Output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins.

#### Function Summary
- The function processes up to 1000 test cases.
- It outputs 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions:
  - If \(a = b\), output 'Bob'.
  - If \(a = 1\), output 'Alice'.
  - If \(b = 1\), output 'Bob'.
  - If \(a\) is odd, output 'Bob'.
