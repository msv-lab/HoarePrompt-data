You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice

    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). Based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\), it outputs either 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case. Specifically, if \(a\) equals \(b\), it outputs 'Bob'. If \(a\) is 1, it outputs 'Alice'. If \(b\) is 1, it outputs 'Bob'. If \(a\) is odd, it outputs 'Bob'. If \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, it outputs 'Alice'. If \(a\) is greater than \(b\), it outputs 'Bob', otherwise it outputs 'Alice'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading pairs of integers `(a, b)` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets respectively.

2. **Conditions and Outputs:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine the winner:
     - If `a == b`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `a == 1`, it prints 'Alice'.
     - If `b == 1`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `a % 2 == 1`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, it prints 'Alice'.
     - If `a > b`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

### Reasoning

To determine the correctness, we need to verify if these conditions cover all possible scenarios and align with the optimal strategy for both players.

#### Key Observations:
- **Turn-Based Game:** Each player alternates moves, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
- **Exchange and Removal:** Players can either exchange wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
- **Winning Strategy:** The key is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

#### Analyzing Conditions:
1. **Equal Coins (`a == b`):**
   - If both players have the same number of coins, the next player can always mirror the previous player's move, leading to a draw if both play optimally. However, since the problem states that the player who cannot make a move loses, the player who starts (Alice) will lose because Bob can always mirror her moves. Thus, printing 'Bob' is correct.

2. **Single Coin (`a == 1` or `b == 1`):**
   - If one player has only one coin, the other player can always force them to lose by removing the last coin and not swapping. Therefore, printing 'Alice' when `a == 1` and 'Bob' when `b == 1` is correct.

3. **Odd Number of Coins (`a % 2 == 1`):**
   - If `a` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and not swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Thus, printing 'Bob' when `a % 2 == 1` is correct.

4. **Even Number of Coins and Odd Number of Coins (`a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`):**
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Thus, printing 'Alice' when `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1` is correct.

5. **More Coins in One Wallet (`a > b`):**
   - If `a > b`, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Thus, printing 'Bob' when `a > b` is correct.

6. **Otherwise:**
   - The remaining condition covers all other cases, which should logically fall under the above rules. If none of the above conditions match, the program defaults to printing 'Alice', which might not be correct in all scenarios but is consistent with the given logic.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the conditions and their implications, the program appears to cover most scenarios correctly. However, there might be edge cases or more complex strategies not explicitly covered by the given conditions. But based on the provided examples and the problem description, the program seems to handle the basic winning conditions accurately.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **True**
