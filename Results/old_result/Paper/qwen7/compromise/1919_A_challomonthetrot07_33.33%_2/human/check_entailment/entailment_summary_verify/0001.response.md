### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the function summary. We need to ensure that the program correctly handles all possible scenarios and aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading pairs of integers `(a, b)` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets respectively.

2. **Conditions and Outputs:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine the winner:
     - If `a == b`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `a == 1`, it prints 'Alice'.
     - If `b == 1`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `a % 2 == 1`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, it prints 'Alice'.
     - If `a > b`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Key Observations:
- **Turn-Based Game:** Each player alternates moves, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
- **Exchange and Removal:** Players can either exchange wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
- **Winning Strategy:** The key is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

#### Analyzing Conditions:
1. **Equal Coins (`a == b`):**
   - If both players have the same number of coins, the next player can always mirror the previous player's move, leading to a draw if both play optimally. However, since the problem states that the player who cannot make a move loses, the player who starts (Alice) will lose because Bob can always mirror her moves. Thus, printing 'Bob' is correct.

2. **Single Coin (`a == 1` or `b == 1`):**
   - If one player has only one coin, the other player can always force them to lose by removing the last coin and not swapping. Therefore, printing 'Alice' when `a == 1` and 'Bob' when `b == 1` is correct.

3. **Odd Number of Coins (`a % 2 == 1`):**
   - If `a` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and not swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Thus, printing 'Bob' when `a % 2 == 1` is correct.

4. **Even Number of Coins and Odd Number of Coins (`a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`):**
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Thus, printing 'Alice' when `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1` is correct.

5. **More Coins in One Wallet (`a > b`):**
   - If `a > b`, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Thus, printing 'Bob' when `a > b` is correct.

6. **Otherwise:**
   - The remaining condition covers all other cases. However, the logic here is flawed. The program defaults to printing 'Alice' in this case, which does not necessarily align with the optimal strategy. For example, consider the case where `a = 2` and `b = 2`. According to the problem, both players can mirror each other's moves, leading to a draw. However, the program incorrectly prints 'Alice' in this scenario.

### Conclusion

The program fails to handle the general case correctly. Specifically, the condition `else: print('Alice')` does not cover all scenarios and does not align with the optimal strategy for both players. There are cases where the program incorrectly determines the winner.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly and does not align with the optimal strategy for both players in all cases.
