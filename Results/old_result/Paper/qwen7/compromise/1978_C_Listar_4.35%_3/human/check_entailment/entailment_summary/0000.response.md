### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze how the functions work together to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If so, it immediately returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no solution exists because the Manhattan value of any permutation must be even.
   - It calculates `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even.
     - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
     - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
   - It checks if `max_k` is less than `k`. If so, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no solution exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as parameters.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It manipulates the list by moving the last element to the front repeatedly until `k` becomes 0 or the operation cannot be performed.
   - If `k` becomes 0, it returns the modified list `l`.
   - If the loop completes without `k` becoming 0, the list is reversed and returned.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function takes a list `l` and prints "YES" followed by the elements of `l` on a single line separated by spaces.
   - It then prints an empty line and returns `None`.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function calls `func_2()` to get values for `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to get the list `l`.
   - It then calls `func_3(l)` to print the result.
   - Finally, it returns whatever `func_3(l)` returns (which is `None`).

### Analysis:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `k` is odd, `func_2` correctly returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no solution exists.
  - If `k` is even and within the possible range for a given `n`, `func_1` should generate a valid permutation.
  - `func_3` correctly formats and prints the result.

- **Logic Flow**:
  - `func_2` ensures that `k` is even and within the possible range for a given `n`.
  - `func_1` generates a permutation with the required Manhattan value.
  - `func_3` prints the result in the correct format.

Given that all functions work as intended and handle edge cases correctly, the overall program should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
