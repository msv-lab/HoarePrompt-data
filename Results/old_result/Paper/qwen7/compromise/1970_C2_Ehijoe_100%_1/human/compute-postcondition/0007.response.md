Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each value is a list containing up to `n-1` integers representing the adjacent nodes to the corresponding key, `leaves` is a deque**

Explanation: The code initializes a deque named `leaves`. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, `empty`, or `nodes`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only new variable introduced is `leaves`, which is now initialized as an empty deque.
