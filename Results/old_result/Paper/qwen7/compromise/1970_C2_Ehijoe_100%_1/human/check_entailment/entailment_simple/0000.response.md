### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game played on a tree where players take turns moving a stone from one node to another. The game ends when no valid move is possible, and the player unable to make a move loses. The goal is to determine the winner of each round given the tree structure and the starting node.

2. **Key Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(nodes, start, parent)`**: This function checks if the current node can force a win in the game. It recursively checks all its children and ensures that at least one child node cannot force a win. If such a condition is met, it returns `True`, indicating that the current node can force a win. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **`func_2()`**:
   - **Tree Construction**: The function constructs the tree from the input edges and stores it in a `defaultdict` where each key points to a list of its neighbors.
   - **Leaf Nodes Identification**: It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) and stores them in a `deque`.
   - **Starting Node Input**: Reads the starting node for the game.
   - **Game Outcome Determination**: Calls `func_1(nodes, start)` to determine if the starting node can force a win. If `func_1` returns `True`, "Ron" wins; otherwise, "Hermione" wins.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The function correctly handles the tree structure and the game logic.
   - The recursive function `func_1` accurately determines if a node can force a win by ensuring that at least one of its children cannot force a win.
   - The overall logic aligns with the game rules and the problem statement.

5. **Execution States**:
   - The provided execution states match the expected behavior of the functions.
   - The transitions between states are logical and consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the starting node and the tree structure. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
