Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- `i` is `0`
- `string` is an input string from the user
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string, with the first character assigned to `x`
- `n` is `1`
- `count` is `0`
- `count2` is either `0` or `1`
- `j` is `0`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables because it directly outputs the string literal `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
