Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is either equal to `j` or greater than 0, `s[j]` remains not equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this step, the variable `count2` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
