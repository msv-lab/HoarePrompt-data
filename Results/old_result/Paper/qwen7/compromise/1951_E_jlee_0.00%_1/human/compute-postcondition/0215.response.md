Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `string` is a new input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `x` is the first character of `s`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is `False`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, `j` is 0, and the loop continues until `x` equals the last character of `s`. If `x` appears `n-1` times in `s`, the loop stops.**
