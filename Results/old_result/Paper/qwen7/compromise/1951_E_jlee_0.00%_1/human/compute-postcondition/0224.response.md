Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- The current value of `j` is such that the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.

Here, `n` is the length of the string `s`. The condition states that the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`. This means that if we take the character at index `j` and compare it with the character at the opposite end of the string (index `n - 1 - j`), they should not be the same.

However, the print statement simply prints the string `string`. Given that there is no specific value assigned to the string `string` in the provided information, we assume that the string being printed is the same as `s`.

Output: **s**
