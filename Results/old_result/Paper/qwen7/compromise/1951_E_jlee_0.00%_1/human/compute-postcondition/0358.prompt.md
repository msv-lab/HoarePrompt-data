Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `x` is the first character of `s`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is `False`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `x` is the first character of `s`
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string, `done` is set to True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is equal to `j`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count` remains greater than 0, `s[j]` remains not equal to `x`, and `done` is set to True. If `count` is not greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1 and remains greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is either equal to `j` or greater than 0, `s[j]` remains not equal to `x`, and if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is not greater than `count`, then `count2` is incremented by 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, and `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is updated to `j`, and `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`. Otherwise, `count2` is incremented by 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
