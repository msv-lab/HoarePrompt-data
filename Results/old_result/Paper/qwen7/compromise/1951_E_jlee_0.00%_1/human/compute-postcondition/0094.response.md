Postcondition: `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `done` is `True`, `count` is less than 1, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` remains unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
