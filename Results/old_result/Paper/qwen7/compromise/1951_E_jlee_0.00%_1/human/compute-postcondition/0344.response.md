Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`. If `count` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` is 0, and we continue the most internal loop or if statement.**
