Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string, `done` is set to True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is equal to `j`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count` remains greater than 0, `s[j]` remains not equal to `x`, and `done` is set to True. If `count` is not greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1 and remains greater than 0.**
