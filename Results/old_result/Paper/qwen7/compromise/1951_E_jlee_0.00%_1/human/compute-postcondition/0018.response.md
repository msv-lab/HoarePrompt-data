Output State: **`i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is the length of the list `s` and equals 1, `done` is `False`, the current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of `s`.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values or affect the state of the program. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if there was one) and moves on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables, their previous values remain unchanged.
