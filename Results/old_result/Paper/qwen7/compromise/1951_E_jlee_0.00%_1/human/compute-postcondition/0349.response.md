Output State: **`done` is set to `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `done`, `count`, `j`, `s[j + 1]`, or `x`. After executing the `break` statement, the conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged except for the fact that we have exited the loop or if statement.
