Output State: **`done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `done`, which remains `True`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. Since no other variables are affected, the only change is the indication of breaking out of the loop or statement.
