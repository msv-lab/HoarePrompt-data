Output State: **`i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is the length of the list `s` and equals 1, `done` is `False`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in the given code does not modify any variable's value or perform any operations. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if there was one) and continues with the next iteration. Since no changes occur to the variables, their previous states remain unchanged.
