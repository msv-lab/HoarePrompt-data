The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is the length of the list `s` and equals 1, `done` is `False`, and the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`. Additionally, if `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is not equal to `x`, then `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is not equal to `x`. Otherwise, `n` is even or the middle element of `s` is equal to `x`.**
