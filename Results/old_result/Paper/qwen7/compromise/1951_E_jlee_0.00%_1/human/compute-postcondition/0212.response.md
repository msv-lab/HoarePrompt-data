Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `string` is a new input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `x` is the first character of `s`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is `False`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, `j` is 0, and if `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, we continue the loop or iteration.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because the postconditions provided for both parts are identical. Therefore, the overall postcondition after the if-else block executes is the same as the initial postcondition.
