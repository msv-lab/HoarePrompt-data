Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- The current value of `j` is such that the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.

The print statement simply outputs the number `1` without any reference to the string `s` or the variable `j`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
