The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\). If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) equals \(-a\) or \(-b\), it prints 'no'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
