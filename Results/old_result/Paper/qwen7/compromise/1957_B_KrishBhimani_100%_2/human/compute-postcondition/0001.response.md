Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes an input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). The new variable `l1` is created and assigned the result of the split operation, which is a list of strings.
