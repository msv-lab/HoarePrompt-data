Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 2 or 4 depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is true or false, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
