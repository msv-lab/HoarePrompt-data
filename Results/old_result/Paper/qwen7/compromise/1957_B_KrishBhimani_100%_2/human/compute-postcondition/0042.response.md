Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.**

In this step-by-step process, the code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the list `l1`, which is a list of strings, and uses the `map` function along with `int` to convert each string in `l1` to an integer. Since `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first two elements of `l1` are converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `k`, respectively. The rest of the list `l1` remains unchanged.
