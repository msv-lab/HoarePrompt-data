Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, and `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `arr`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions. The new variable `arr` is created and set to an empty list.
