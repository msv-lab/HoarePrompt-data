Output State: **`i` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 4, and the current value of `temp` is less than `k`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
