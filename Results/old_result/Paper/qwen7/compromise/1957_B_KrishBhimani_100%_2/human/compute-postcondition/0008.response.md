Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `k0 = k` assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. No other variables are affected. The initial values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
