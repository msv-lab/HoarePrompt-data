Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1.**

The code initializes `temp` to 1, which does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
