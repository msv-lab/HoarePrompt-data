The only variable in the loop head is the condition itself, which is `True`. Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute the first time regardless of the current state of the variables.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the variables `i`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `temp` to make the loop execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1**
