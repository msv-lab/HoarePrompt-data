### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to count occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively. It iterates through each character in the string and increments the appropriate counter.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences, the program compares `ac` and `bc`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases where the string can be composed of any combination of 'A' and 'B'. It correctly identifies the more frequent character in each test case.
5. **Distinct Test Cases**: The problem statement mentions that all strings in a test are different, which the program inherently respects since it processes each test case independently.

Given these points, the program appears to be logically sound and should work correctly for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
