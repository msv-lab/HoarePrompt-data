Postcondition: **`ac` and `bc` are either both 1 or both 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 0, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the third character of the string `s`. If `i` equals 'A', then `ac` becomes 2, and `bc` remains either 1 or 0. Otherwise, `ac` remains either 1 or 0, and `bc` becomes 2.**
