Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is 3, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, `total` is 1, and `n` is the length of list `s` with `n` not equal to 2, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
