Output State: **`total` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is initially either 1 or 0. The expression `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans`. If `ans` was 1, it becomes 0, and if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1. In both cases, the new value of `ans` is the opposite of its original value.
