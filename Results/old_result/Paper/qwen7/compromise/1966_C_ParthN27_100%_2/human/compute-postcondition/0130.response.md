Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be between 3 and \( n-3 \), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that was checking the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, the only change is that the loop or conditional block is exited. The conditions on `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
