Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is -1, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `total` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `n` is not equal to 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans ^= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is 1 (or any value between 1 and n-2), `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `total` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `n` is not equal to 2. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is either 0 or 1 (determined by the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`), `total` is 1, and `n` is the length of list `s` with `n` not equal to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is 3, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, `total` is 1, and `n` is the length of list `s` with `n` not equal to 2, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
