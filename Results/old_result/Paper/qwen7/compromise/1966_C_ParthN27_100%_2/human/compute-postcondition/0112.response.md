Output State: **After sorting, the set `s` is converted to a sorted list, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `s` is `[0] + s, and `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `s`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
