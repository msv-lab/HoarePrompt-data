Postcondition: **`n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `s` is `[0] + s`, and `ans` is 1. If `n` is equal to 2, `i` remains as `n-1` and `ans` stays at 1. If `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be between `n-2` and 1 (inclusive), and `ans` will be 1 if the number of iterations is even, or 0 if the number of iterations is odd.**
