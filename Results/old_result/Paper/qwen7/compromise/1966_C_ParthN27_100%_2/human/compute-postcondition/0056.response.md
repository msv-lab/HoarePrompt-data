Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n-2`, `s` is a set containing `arr[n-2]` and `arr[i]`, `ans` is 0, `total` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Given that initially `i` was `n-1`, after executing the code, `i` becomes `n-2`. The set `s` now contains both `arr[n-2]` and `arr[i]` (which is now `arr[n-2]` since `i` is decremented). All other variables remain unchanged.
