Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue if `i < n`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (though not explicitly shown, this is implied by the structure of the loop), `i` will be increased by 1 from its previous value.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.
   - `arr[i]` will be added to the set `s` in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be increased by 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `arr[i]` will be added to the set `s`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`**
