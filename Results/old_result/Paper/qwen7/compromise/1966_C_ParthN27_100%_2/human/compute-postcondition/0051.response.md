Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0, `total` is 1, `i` is less than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`i`, `s`, `ans`, `total`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
