Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.**

The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, this precondition remains unchanged. The value of `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`, but the specific value of `arr[i]` is not provided, so it is described as being added to the set `s`.
