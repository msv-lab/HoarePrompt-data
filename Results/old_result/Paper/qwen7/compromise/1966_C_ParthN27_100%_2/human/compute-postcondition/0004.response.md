Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n`: This is an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
