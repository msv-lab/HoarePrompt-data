Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` must be between `n-2` and 1 (inclusive).
- `ans` will be 0 if the number of iterations is even, or 1 if the number of iterations is odd.
- The current value of `ans` is true since it enters the if condition.

The `print('Alice')` statement will print the string "Alice".

Output: **Alice**
