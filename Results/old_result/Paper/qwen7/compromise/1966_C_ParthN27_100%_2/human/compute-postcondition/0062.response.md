Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is -1, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0, `total` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

The code `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. Since `s` initially contains all elements from `arr`, sorting `s` does not change the values of `arr`, `i`, `ans`, `total`, or `n`. The only change is that `s` is now sorted.
