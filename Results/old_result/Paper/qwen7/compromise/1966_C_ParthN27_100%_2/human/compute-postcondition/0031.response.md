Output State: **`total` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1 or not, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement we were inside. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
