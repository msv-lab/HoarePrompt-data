Output State: **`total` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0 if `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1. This means that if `ans` was 0 before the operation, it will become 1, and if `ans` was 1 before the operation, it will become 0. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and the condition for `ans` remain unchanged.
