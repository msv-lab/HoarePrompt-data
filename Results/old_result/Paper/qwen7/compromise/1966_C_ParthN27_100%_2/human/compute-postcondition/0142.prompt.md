Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers a (length n) represents the initial number of stones in each pile, with each a_i satisfying 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1, and either `n` is equal to 2 or `total` is 1, `i` is less than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is either -1 or `n-2`, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` reflects the final toggle state based on the sequence in `s`, `total` is 1, and `n` is the length of list `s`. If the length of list `s` is 2, `i` is -1 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is `n-2`, and `ans` is 1 if the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` is ever met during the loop; otherwise, `ans` is toggled between 0 and 1 with each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `s` is `[0] + s`, and `ans` is 1. If `n` is equal to 2, `i` remains as `n-1` and `ans` stays at 1. If `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be between `n-2` and 1 (inclusive), and `ans` will be 1 if the number of iterations is even, or 0 if the number of iterations is odd.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
