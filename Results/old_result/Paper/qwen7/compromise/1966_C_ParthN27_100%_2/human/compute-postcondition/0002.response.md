Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on whitespace, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was an input integer before the code execution.
