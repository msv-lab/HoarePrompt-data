Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Pile Count and Initial Stones**: For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile stored in `arr`. This is handled correctly.

3. **Set and Sorting**: The program converts the list of stones into a set to remove duplicates, sorts the resulting list, and prepends a `0` to this sorted list. This step is necessary to handle the logic of the game correctly.

4. **Game Logic**: The core logic of the program checks if the length of the modified list `s` is 2. If it is, it prints "Alice" because in this case, the piles are identical, and Alice can always win by removing the same number of stones from each pile. Otherwise, it iterates through the list to check the differences between consecutive elements. If any difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks, indicating that the game state changes significantly, and the result is determined based on the parity of the number of iterations.

5. **Output Determination**: The variable `ans` is toggled based on whether the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1. If the length of `s` is greater than 2, `ans` is toggled for each element until the end of the list. The final value of `ans` determines the winner: if `ans` is 1, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when all piles have the same number of stones (length of `s` is 2) and when the piles have different numbers of stones (length of `s` is greater than 2).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
