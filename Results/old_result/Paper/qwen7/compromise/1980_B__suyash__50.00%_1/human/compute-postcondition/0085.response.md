Postcondition: `i` is 3, `t` is the same as before, `l` has been fully traversed, `k` is the third element of the list `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` equals `n`, then `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string `a` and converting each element to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `b`, and `f` is the second element of the list `b`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `k == n` is not met.
