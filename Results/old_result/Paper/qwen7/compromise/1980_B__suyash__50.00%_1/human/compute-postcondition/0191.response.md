Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is encountered, the loop or conditional block is exited. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, but the condition that either `fav` is equal to `l[3]` or `k` is less than or equal to 0 remains valid. Therefore, after the `break` statement, `k` is less than or equal to 0.
