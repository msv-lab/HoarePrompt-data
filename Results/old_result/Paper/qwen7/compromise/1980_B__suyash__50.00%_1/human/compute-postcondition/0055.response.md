Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `k` is defined as `k - dic[l[0]]`. However, since `k` is not initialized or given an explicit value, and `dic` and `l` are not further defined, we can only describe `k` in terms of its definition.
- `l` must have at least one element, but no specific value is provided for `l`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since there are no variables or objects from the initial state that influence this print statement, the output remains straightforward.

Output: **YES**
