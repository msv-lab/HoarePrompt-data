Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was modifying the value of `k`. Since the `break` statement does not assign new values to any variables, the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `k` is greater than or equal to 0 still holds true.
