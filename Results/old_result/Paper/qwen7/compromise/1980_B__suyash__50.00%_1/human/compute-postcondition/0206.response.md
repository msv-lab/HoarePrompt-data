Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[4]]`, `len(l)` is greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `dic`, `l`, or `len(l)`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
