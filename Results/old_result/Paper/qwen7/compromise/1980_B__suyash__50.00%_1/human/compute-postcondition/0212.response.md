Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 4.
- `k` is decreased by `dic[l[4]]`.
- `len(l)` is greater than 2.
- Either `k` is less than or equal to 0, `fav` is equal to `l[3]`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given this information, the print statement will simply output the string 'YES'. The values of `k`, `dic`, `l`, and `fav` are not necessary to determine the output of the print statement since the statement itself is hardcoded.

Output: **YES**
