Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is less than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code, the only effect is that the execution would exit such a block. Given the initial conditions, `i` remains 3, `k` is still less than or equal to 0, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
