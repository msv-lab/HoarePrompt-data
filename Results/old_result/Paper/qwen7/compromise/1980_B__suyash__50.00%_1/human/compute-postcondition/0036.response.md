Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `l` must have at least one element.
- `fav` is equal to the first element of `l`.
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[0]]`.
- The current value of `k` is less than 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('MAYBE')
```

The print statement simply outputs the string `'MAYBE'`. The values of `i`, `l`, `fav`, and `k` are not directly used in this print statement, and their specific values do not affect the output.

Output: **MAYBE**
