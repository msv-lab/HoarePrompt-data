Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then `k` is 0, `res` is -1, and `ans` is either `dif` or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is -2, `k` remains either `-dif * 2` or 0, and `ans` remains either `dif` or 0.
