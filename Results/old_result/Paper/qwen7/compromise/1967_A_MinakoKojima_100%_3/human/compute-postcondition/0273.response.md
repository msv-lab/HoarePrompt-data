Output State: `ans_list` must contain the sum of `ans` values calculated for each iteration, with each `ans` value being printed during the loop. After all iterations, `ans_list` will have as many elements as there were iterations, and each element in `ans_list` will be the value of `a` (which is the current element being iterated over) from each respective iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, `ans_list` will contain the sequence of values that `a` took on during each iteration of the loop, and since the loop prints each `a`, `ans_list` will be a list of these printed values in the order they were printed.
