Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `dif` is 0, `ans` is increased by `res`, `k` is 0, `res` is adjusted by adding `k % n` which is 0, `ans_list` contains the final value of `ans` after all iterations, the `a` list remains unchanged, and `ans_list` now includes the updated value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The line `ans_list.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. Since `ans` was previously updated by `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, and then increased by `res` (which is `k % n` and equals 0), the value of `ans` remains the same as after the last update. Therefore, `ans_list` now contains the updated value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
