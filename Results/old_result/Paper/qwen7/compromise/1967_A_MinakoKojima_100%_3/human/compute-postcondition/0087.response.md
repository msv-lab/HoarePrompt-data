Output State: **`ans` is incremented by `res`, `res` is a non-negative integer which has been decremented by `n-1`, `ans` is incremented by `k // n`, `res` is incremented by `k % n` if `k` is not fully consumed (i.e., `k != 0`), `res` is further adjusted by subtracting 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` if `k` is not 0, `ans_list` contains the current value of `ans`, `dif` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, and `i` is incremented with each iteration.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. This does not change the values of `ans`, `res`, `k`, `n`, `i`, `dif`, or the list `a`. It only adds the current value of `ans` to `ans_list`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new information about `ans_list`.
