Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved here are:
   - `_`: A placeholder variable used to iterate over the range.
   - `int(input())`: This is the expression that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**: 
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and doesn't need to be explicitly adjusted as it will take on values from the range.
   - The key object to consider is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must evaluate to a positive integer (greater than 0).

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `ans_list` is already described as an empty list and does not affect the loop condition, it remains unchanged. The focus should be on ensuring that the loop can execute based on the input.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**State:**
**`ans_list` is an empty list, int(input()) must be greater than 0**
