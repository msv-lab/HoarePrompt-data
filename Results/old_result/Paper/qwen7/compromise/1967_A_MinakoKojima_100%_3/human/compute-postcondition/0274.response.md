Output State: `ans_list` must have as many elements as there are iterations of the loop, with each element being the value of `a` from each respective iteration of the loop.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans_list` will contain a list where each element corresponds to the value of `a` printed during each iteration of the loop. The length of `ans_list` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop ran.
