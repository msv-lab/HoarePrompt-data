Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
