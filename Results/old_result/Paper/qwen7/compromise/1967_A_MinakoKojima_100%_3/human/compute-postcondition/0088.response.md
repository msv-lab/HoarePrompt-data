Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` (which is just a placeholder for the loop variable) and the expression `range(int(input()))`. The key variables here are `i` (which is the loop variable) and the input value from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented with each iteration, at the start of the first iteration, `i` is 0. After each iteration, `i` increases by 1.

3. **Determine the input value**: The input value is determined by `int(input())`. Let's denote this value as `N`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` starts at 0 and will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - The input value `N` remains the same for each iteration since it is read once before the loop starts.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the start of the next iteration:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The input value `N` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ans` is incremented by `res`, `res` is a non-negative integer which has been decremented by `N-1`, `ans` is incremented by `k // N`, `res` is incremented by `k % N` if `k` is not fully consumed (i.e., `k != 0`), `res` is further adjusted by subtracting 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` if `k` is not 0, `ans_list` contains the current value of `ans`, `dif` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, and `i` is incremented with each iteration.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, the new state will be:

State: **`ans` is incremented by `res`, `res` is a non-negative integer which has been decremented by `N-1`, `ans` is incremented by `k // N`, `res` is incremented by `k % N` if `k` is not fully consumed (i.e., `k != 0`), `res` is further adjusted by subtracting 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` if `k` is not 0, `ans_list` contains the current value of `ans`, `dif` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

So, the final state is:

State: **`ans` is incremented by `res`, `res` is a non-negative integer which has been decremented by `N-1`, `ans` is incremented by `k // N`, `res` is incremented by `k % N` if `k` is not fully consumed (i.e., `k != 0`), `res` is further adjusted by subtracting 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` if `k` is not 0, `ans_list` contains the current value of `ans`, `dif` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
