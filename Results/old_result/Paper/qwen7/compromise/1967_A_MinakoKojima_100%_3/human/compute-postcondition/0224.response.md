Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code `res += k % (i + 1)` updates the value of `res` by adding the result of `k % (i + 1)` to it. Given the initial state, `k` is 0, `i` is 2, so `k % (i + 1)` is `0 % 3`, which equals 0. Therefore, `res` changes from -2 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
