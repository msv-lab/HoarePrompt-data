Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not equal to 0, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
