Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is -2, `k` is either `-dif * 2` or 0, `ans` is `2 * dif`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif` adds the value of `dif` to `ans`. Given that `ans` was initially either `dif` or 0, and considering the condition that if `dif` equals 0, `res` is set to -2 and `ans` remains either `dif` or 0, the only way `ans` could have been -2 is if `dif` was 0. In all other cases, `ans` would be `2 * dif`. Since `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is -2, `k` is either `-dif * 2` or 0, and the condition for `ans` being `2 * dif` holds true when `dif` is not 0.
