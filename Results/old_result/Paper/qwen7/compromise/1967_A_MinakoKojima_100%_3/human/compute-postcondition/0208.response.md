Postcondition: `i` is 0, `dif` is not equal to 0, `res` is -2, `k` is equal to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, and `ans` is `ans` plus `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`. If `k` is not greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `i` is not 0, `dif` is not equal to 0, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
