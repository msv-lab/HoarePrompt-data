Output State: **`ans_list` contains the sum of `ans` values calculated for each iteration, with each `ans` value being computed based on the logic within the loop. The final `ans` value after all iterations is the last element in `ans_list`.**

To explain in more detail:
- After all iterations of the loop, `ans_list` will contain all the intermediate `ans` values calculated during each iteration.
- The final value of `ans` will be the last element in `ans_list`.
- Each `ans` value is computed based on the sorted list `a`, the integers `n` and `k`, and the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
- The loop processes each input set of `n`, `k`, and `a` independently, updating `ans` and `res` according to the given conditions.
- The loop continues until all inputs are processed, and the final `ans` value is appended to `ans_list` after the loop completes.
