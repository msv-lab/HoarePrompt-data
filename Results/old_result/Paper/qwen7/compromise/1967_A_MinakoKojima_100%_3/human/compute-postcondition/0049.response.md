Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 3, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` is unchanged, `k` is 0, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is adjusted by adding `k % (i + 1)`.
