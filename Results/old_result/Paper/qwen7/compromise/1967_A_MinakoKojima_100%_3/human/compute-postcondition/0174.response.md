Postcondition: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `dif` is undefined or could be considered as 0, `ans` is the final accumulated value plus `k // n`, `k` is 0, `res` is adjusted by adding `k % n`, which is 0, `ans_list` contains the final value of `ans` after all iterations, the `a` list remains unchanged, and the `if` condition `(k != 0)` is false.**
