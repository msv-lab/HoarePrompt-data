Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is -3, `k` is `k - dif * 3`, `ans` is `2 * dif`**

Explanation: The code `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` was initially `-2`, after executing this line, `res` becomes `-3`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
