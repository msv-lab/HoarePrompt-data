Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer which has been decremented by `n-1`, `ans` is incremented by `k // n`, `res` is incremented by `k % n` if `k` is not fully consumed (i.e., `k != 0`), `k` is partially consumed (not set to 0) if `k` is not 0, `dif` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, and `i` is incremented with each iteration. If `k` is not 0, `res` is further adjusted by subtracting 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`.
