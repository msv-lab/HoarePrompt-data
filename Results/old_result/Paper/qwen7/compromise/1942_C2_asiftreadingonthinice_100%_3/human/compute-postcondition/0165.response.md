Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing either 1 or the value `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`, and `i` is 5. If `a[5] - a[4] == 2`, then `tmp` is updated to contain the value `1`; otherwise, `tmp` remains as `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`.
