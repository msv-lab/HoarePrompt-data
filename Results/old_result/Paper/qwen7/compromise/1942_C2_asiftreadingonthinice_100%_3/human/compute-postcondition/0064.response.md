Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be the last element in the `tmp` list, `tmp` will be an empty list since it will be consumed during the iterations, `ans` will be the sum of all elements in `tmp` where each element `i` in `tmp` was added to `ans` if `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`, and `y` will be reduced by the cumulative amount of `i - 1` for each iteration where the condition was met.

In simpler terms, `i` will point to the last remaining value in `tmp` after all iterations, `tmp` will be empty, `ans` will hold the total sum of all valid `i` values from `tmp` that satisfied the condition, and `y` will be reduced by the sum of all valid `i - 1` values.
