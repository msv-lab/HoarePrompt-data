Output State: **`tmp` must contain at least one element, y is the original value of y minus (i - 1), ans is ans plus i.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decremented by the value of `i - 1`. Since `i - 1` is a specific expression, we use it directly. The other variables (`tmp` and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
