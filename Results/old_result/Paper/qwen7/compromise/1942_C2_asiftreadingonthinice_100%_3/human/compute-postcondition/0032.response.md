Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`. The variable `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` is exactly 2. The variable `tmp` will contain the half of the difference between consecutive elements in `a` whenever this difference is even but not 2.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will point to the last index of the list `a`. The variable `ans` will hold the count of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that differ by exactly 2. The list `tmp` will contain the half of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` whenever these differences are even numbers but not 2.
