Output State: **`i` is 3, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` retains its original value based on the condition `a[2] - a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 3, this translates to appending `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` to `tmp`. The other variables (`len(a)`, `ans`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
