Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is x + y - 2, `i` is the smallest remaining value in `tmp`, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is the remaining value after all valid subtractions from `tmp` have been made, `ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input, `tt` is the same as before, `tmp` is now an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, and if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 != 0`, then `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or 3, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `tmp` is a list depending on the condition `a[2] - a[1]`, and `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` (where `i` is 2), then `ans` is 1; otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, `ans` is updated accordingly, otherwise `ans` retains its original value based on the condition `a[2] - a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `tmp` is a list. If `a[3] - a[2] == 2`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`. If `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0` and `(a[3] - a[2] != 2)`, `ans` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` retains its original value based on the condition `a[2] - a[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
