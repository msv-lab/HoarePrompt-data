Output State: **`i` is the first element of `tmp`; `tmp` is a sorted list with at least one element; `ans` is increased by `i` - 1; `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is the first element of `tmp`. The value of `ans` is already increased by `i`, so it does not change here. The value of `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.
