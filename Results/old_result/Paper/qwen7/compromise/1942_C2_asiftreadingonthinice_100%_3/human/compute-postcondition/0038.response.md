Output State: **`i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` is exactly 2, `tmp` will contain the half of the difference between consecutive elements in `a` whenever this difference is even but not 2, and `tmp` now includes the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. The condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2)` is false, and the expression `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. This value is derived from the condition that `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even and not equal to 2. The other conditions and the values of `i`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain as per the initial postconditions.
