Output State: **`tt` is an input integer, and it represents the number of test cases.**

The code reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`tt`). This value is stored in the variable `tt`. The initial conditions and constraints for `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged for the subsequent lines of code, but they are not yet read or processed. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `tt` and retains the initial constraints for `n`, `x`, and `y`.
