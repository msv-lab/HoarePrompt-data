Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The list `a` is modified to be sorted.
