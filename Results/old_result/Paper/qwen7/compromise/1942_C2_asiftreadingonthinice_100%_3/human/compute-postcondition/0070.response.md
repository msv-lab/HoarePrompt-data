Output State: **`i` is the smallest remaining value in `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `tmp` that were successfully subtracted from `y` without making `y` negative, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is the remaining value after all valid subtractions from `tmp` have been made, `ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `tt` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `ans`, `tmp`, `y`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `tt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
