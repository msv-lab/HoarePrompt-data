Output State: **After executing the if-else block, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` is exactly 2, `tmp` will contain the half of the difference between consecutive elements in `a` whenever this difference is even but not 2, and `tmp` will also include the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2)` is true. The `tmp` list is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `tmp.sort()` sorts the list `tmp`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `ans`, or the condition for adding elements to `tmp`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `ans`, and the conditions for adding elements to `tmp` remain unchanged. The only change is that `tmp` is now sorted.
