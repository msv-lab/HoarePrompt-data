Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3.
   - The length of the list `a` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the new state of `i`**:
   - If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - If `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate because `i` would exceed `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `a`**:
   - The length of `a` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration, so `len(a)` is still greater than 0.
   - Since the loop continues, `a` itself does not change.

5. **Summarize the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3 (since `i` was 2 and the loop continues).
   - `len(a)` remains greater than 0.
   - `tmp` and `ans` are not directly affected by the loop head, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `tmp` is a list depending on the condition `a[2] - a[1]`, and `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `a[3] - a[2] == 2`, then `ans` is 1; otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, `ans` is updated accordingly, otherwise `ans` retains its original value based on the condition `a[2] - a[1]`.**
