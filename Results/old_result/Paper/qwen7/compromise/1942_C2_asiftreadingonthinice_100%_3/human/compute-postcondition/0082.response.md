Output State: **`tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, the current value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 0, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, and the current value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2` is equal to 0, the value appended to `tmp` is specifically `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
