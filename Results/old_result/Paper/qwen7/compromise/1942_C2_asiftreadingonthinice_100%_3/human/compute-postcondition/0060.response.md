Output State: **`ans` is increased by `i`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1`, `i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decremented by the value of `i - 1`. The value of `i` remains the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`, and `ans` is still increased by `i`. The state of `tmp` and `i_end` remains unchanged.
