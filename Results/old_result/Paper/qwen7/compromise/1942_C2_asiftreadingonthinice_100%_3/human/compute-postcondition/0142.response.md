Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `ans`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while adding the new empty list `tmp`.
