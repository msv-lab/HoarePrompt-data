Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `ii` and `tt`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is the smallest remaining value in `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the sum of all elements in `tmp` that were successfully subtracted from `y` without making `y` negative.
   - `tmp` is an empty list.
   - `y` is the remaining value after all valid subtractions from `tmp` have been made.
   - `ans` is incremented by `y`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `ii` in the range from `0` to `tt-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `ii < tt`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ii` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `ii` will be `1`.
   - `tt` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `i`, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the loop body. However, since no specific operations are mentioned in the loop body, we assume these variables remain as they are unless explicitly changed within the loop body.

Given the information provided and the loop structure, the only variables that change are `ii` and `tt`. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `tmp`, `y`) remain as they are at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is the smallest remaining value in `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `tmp` that were successfully subtracted from `y` without making `y` negative, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is the remaining value after all valid subtractions from `tmp` have been made, `ii` is 1, `tt` is the same as before**.
