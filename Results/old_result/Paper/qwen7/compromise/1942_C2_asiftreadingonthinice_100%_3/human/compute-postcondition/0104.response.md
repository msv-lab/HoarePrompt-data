Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `tmp` will be a list containing elements that satisfy the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` when `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
