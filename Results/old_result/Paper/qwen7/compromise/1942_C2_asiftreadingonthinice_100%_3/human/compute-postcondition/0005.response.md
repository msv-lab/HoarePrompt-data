Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `ans` is `x + y - 2`**.

This means that the variable `ans` is now assigned the value of `x + y - 2`. The other variables (`ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
