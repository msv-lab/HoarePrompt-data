Output State: **`len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 1, ans is 1, the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` is 2, `len(a)` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. After executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` becomes 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
