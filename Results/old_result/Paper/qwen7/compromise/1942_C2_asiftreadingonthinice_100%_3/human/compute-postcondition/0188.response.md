Output State: **`tmp` must contain at least one element, `i` is no longer the first element of `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of the first element of `tmp` plus whatever was previously in `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += i` adds the value of `i` (which is the first element of `tmp`) to `ans`. After this operation, `i` is no longer the first element of `tmp` because it has been used in the calculation. The value of `ans` is updated to include the value of `i`.
