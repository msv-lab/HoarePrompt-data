Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and does not correctly maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The logic for counting triangles when there are consecutive vertices (with a difference of 2) is correct.
   - However, the logic for handling gaps between chosen vertices is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding additional vertices.

2. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The code tries to add triangles by considering gaps between the chosen vertices. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple gaps can be filled with the available `y` vertices.
   - The sorting and iteration over the gaps do not ensure that the maximum number of triangles is formed.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final calculation of `ans` includes an incorrect addition of `y` at the end. This does not reflect the actual number of triangles that can be formed after filling the gaps optimally.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the initial number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
2. Identify and fill the gaps between the chosen vertices optimally using the available `y` vertices.
3. Ensure that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is formed.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for _ in range(tt):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Initial number of triangles
        ans = x - 2
        
        # Handle gaps between chosen vertices
        gaps = []
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            gaps.append(a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
        gaps.append(a[0] + n - a[-1] - 1)
        
        # Sort gaps in descending order to use larger gaps first
        gaps.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Fill gaps with available y vertices
        for gap in gaps:
            if y >= gap - 1:
                ans += gap
                y -= gap - 1
            else:
                break
        
        # Add remaining y vertices if any
        ans += min(y, n - 2 - ans)
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the gaps between chosen vertices are handled optimally, and the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is calculated correctly.
