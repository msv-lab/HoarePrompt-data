Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the chosen vertices are consecutive. For example, consider the input:

```
4 2 2
1 3
```

In this case, the program should be able to choose 2 additional vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of triangles it can form. The correct output should be 2, but the program might output a different value due to its logic not properly accounting for consecutive vertices.

To verify, let's manually check the logic:
- With vertices 1 and 3 chosen, we can add 2 more vertices to form triangles.
- The correct way to maximize triangles is to add vertices 2 and 4, forming triangles (1,2,3), (2,3,4), and (1,3,4).

The program's logic does not account for this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
