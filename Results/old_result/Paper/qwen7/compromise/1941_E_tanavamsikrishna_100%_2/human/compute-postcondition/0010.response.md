Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`, and `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sums of all possible consecutive sublists of length `k` from the original `costs` list. The variable `i` will be set to the last index that the loop could have iterated over, which is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`. The `rows` and `costs` lists remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
