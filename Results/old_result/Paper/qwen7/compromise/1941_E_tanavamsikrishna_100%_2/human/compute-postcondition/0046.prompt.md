Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `row` is a list of integers with its first element being 1, and each subsequent element being the original second element plus 2 times its index (starting from 0), `i` is equal to `d`, `d` must be greater than 2, and the length of `row` is `d`; `min_heap` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an element from `row` and its index, starting from 0, and `min_heap` is a min-heapified version of `min_heap`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(d, len(row)):
    while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
        pass
    row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
    heappush(min_heap, e)
    heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `min_heap` contains the element `(row[i], i)`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))` is executed, adding `(row[i], i)` to `min_heap`. The loop continues to execute as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. After all iterations, `i` will be greater than or equal to `d + 3` and the loop terminates when no further elements in `min_heap` satisfy the condition `heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d - 2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i_prev + 3`, `d` remains the same, the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and `e` is pushed into `min_heap`, and `(row[i], i)` is pushed into `min_heap`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
