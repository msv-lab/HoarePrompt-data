Output State: **`i` is greater than or equal to `d + 3`**

Explanation: The code does not modify any variables or perform any operations that would change the initial conditions. The only requirement is that `i` must be greater than or equal to `d + 3` for the loop to execute the first time, which remains true after the code is executed.
