Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`, and `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list. The `rows` and `costs` lists will remain unchanged. The variable `i` will be set to `len(costs) - k`, indicating the last iteration of the loop. Additionally, the length of the `costs` list must be at least `k - 1` for the loop to execute properly.
