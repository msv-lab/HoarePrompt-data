Output State: **`heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))` is executed, adding `(row[i], i)` to `min_heap`. The loop continues to execute as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. After all iterations, `i` will be greater than or equal to `d + 3` and the loop terminates when no further elements in `min_heap` satisfy the condition `heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d - 2)`.**

This means that the tuple `(row[i], i)` has been added to the `min_heap`. The conditions for the loop to continue or terminate remain unchanged.
