Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 3`.
   - `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must still hold true.
   - Since `i` is fixed and cannot change within this context, we need to ensure that the value popped from `min_heap` still satisfies the condition.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The state of `i` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop condition directly.
   - We need to ensure that the next value popped from `min_heap` still satisfies the condition. Therefore, the value of `heappop(min_heap)[1]` should be such that it is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value popped from `min_heap`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is greater than or equal to `d + 3` and `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**
