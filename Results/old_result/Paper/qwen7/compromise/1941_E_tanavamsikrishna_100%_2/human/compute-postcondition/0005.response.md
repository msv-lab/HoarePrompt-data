Output State: **`total_costs` is now a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, and `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list starting from index `i` to the `total_costs` list. Since `i` is initially set to 0, the first element added to `total_costs` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`. The `rows` list and the `costs` list remain unchanged, and `i` remains 0 because the code does not modify it. The condition that `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k - 1` also remains valid.
