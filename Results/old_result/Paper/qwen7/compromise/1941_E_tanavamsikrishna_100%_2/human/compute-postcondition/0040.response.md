Output State: **`i` must be `i_prev + 2`, `d` remains the same, and the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`.**

Explanation: The `pass` statement does nothing and simply acts as a placeholder. It does not modify any variables or perform any operations. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
