Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` consecutive elements from `costs` appended, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k` - 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the first `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list to `total_costs`. The value of `i` is set to 2, meaning the slicing operation starts from the second element of the `costs` list. The `total_costs` list now includes the sum of the first `k` elements, while other variables remain unchanged.
