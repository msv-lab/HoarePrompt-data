Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `row`, a list of integers representing the depths of river cells, and `d`, a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. The function applies an update rule to each element in `row`, where each element is incremented by the value popped from a `min_heap` and then 1. Finally, the function returns the last element of the updated `row` list.**
