Based on the initial state provided:

- `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.
- `rows` remains unchanged.
- `costs` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `len(costs) - k`, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
- The length of the `costs` list must be at least `k - 1` for the loop to execute properly.

The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value among the sums of every `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

To explain further:
- `total_costs` contains sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.
- Each element in `total_costs` represents the sum of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.
- The `min()` function finds the smallest value among these sums.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest sum among the sums of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(sum of every k consecutive elements from costs)**
