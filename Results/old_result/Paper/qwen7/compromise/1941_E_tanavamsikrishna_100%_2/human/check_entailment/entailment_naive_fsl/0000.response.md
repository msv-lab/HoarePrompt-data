Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints. 

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 1 1 0
0 1 2 0
```
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `4`

The program incorrectly calculates the cost of placing supports. According to the problem description, the cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. The program should ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`, and it should place supports optimally to minimize the total cost.

The `func_1` function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for a single row. It initializes the first `d` elements of the row and then tries to update the rest of the row, but it does not correctly handle the optimal placement of supports to minimize the total cost. This can be seen in the example above, where the expected minimum cost is `3`, but the program outputs `4`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
