Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t, followed by pairs of integers n and k, and a list of integers c. For each test case, it returns information based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters (t, n, k, and a list c). It processes these inputs and provides outputs based on the given constraints and relationships between the parameters.
