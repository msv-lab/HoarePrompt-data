You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Example

Input

    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 2
    
    3 8 1 48 7
    
    6 2
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40
    
    6 3
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40

Output

    2
    1

    1
    6
    
Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; the list of integers c represents the numbers written on the cards, where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each card i.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, the value of k is subtracted by 1 and printed. The final state of t remains unchanged, but the printed values are the result of k-1 for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( c \). It then prints the value \( k - 1 \) for each test case. The final state of the variable \( t \) remains unchanged, but the function outputs \( k - 1 \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, we need to minimize the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards. However, the given program simply prints `k - 1` regardless of the input, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

The correct solution should analyze the frequency of each card and determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further. In this case, the output should be `2`, as we can exchange the three `4`s for two new cards, leaving us with two `1`s and two new cards, resulting in a total of 2 cards.

The provided program fails to account for the actual distribution and reduction of cards, hence it is incorrect.
