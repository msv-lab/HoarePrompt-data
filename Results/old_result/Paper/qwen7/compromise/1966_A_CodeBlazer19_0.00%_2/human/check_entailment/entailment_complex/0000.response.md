Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The function `func()` simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual numbers on the cards (`c`). According to the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the number of cards left by performing operations that allow exchanging `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards. However, the provided code does not take into account the values of the cards at all. Instead, it always prints `k - 1`, which is incorrect because the number of cards left should depend on the distribution of the card values.

The correct approach would involve counting the occurrences of each card value and determining the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of size `k`. This requires a more complex logic than what is implemented in the current function.

Correctness: **False**
