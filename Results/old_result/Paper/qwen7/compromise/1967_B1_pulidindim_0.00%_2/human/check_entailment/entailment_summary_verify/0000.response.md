Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from `count = 2` to `count <= m`. This does not cover all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. **Calculation of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized as `n` and updated inside the loop. The update rule `ans += g / count + 1` seems to be an attempt to increment `ans`, but it does not correctly reflect the count of valid pairs.
3. **Condition Check**: There is no direct check for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. For each pair, calculating \(\gcd(a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Verification:
Given the provided program, it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It attempts to count pairs without properly checking the condition and does not cover all possible pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Final: **False**
