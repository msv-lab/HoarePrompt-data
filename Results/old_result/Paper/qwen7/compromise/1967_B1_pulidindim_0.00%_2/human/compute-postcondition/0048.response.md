Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `countmins - 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 1. So, `g` becomes `g - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
