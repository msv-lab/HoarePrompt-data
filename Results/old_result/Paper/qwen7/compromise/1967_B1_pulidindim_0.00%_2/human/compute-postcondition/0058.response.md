Output State: **`count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 4 - 3`, `ans` is `ans + (g / count + 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `g / count + 1` to its current value. Since the initial value of `g` is `n / 4 - 3`, the updated value of `ans` becomes `ans + ((n / 4 - 3) / 4 + 1)`. The values of `count` and `countmins` remain unchanged.
