Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is `n + (n / count - countmins) / count + 1`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is undefined.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to its current value. Given that `count` is 1 and `countmins` is 0, `g` is calculated as `n / count - countmins`, which simplifies to `n`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `n + (n / 1 - 0) / 1 + 1`, which further simplifies to `n + n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
