Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0) + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is now `n / 2 - 1`**

Explanation: The line `countmins = count - 1` updates the value of `countmins` from 1 to 0. The value of `count` is updated from 3 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
