Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is -1, and `g` is `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = n` simply reassigns the value of `n` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
