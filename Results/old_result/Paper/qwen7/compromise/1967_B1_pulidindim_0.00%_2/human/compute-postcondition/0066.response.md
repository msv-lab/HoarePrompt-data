Output State: **`count` is 5, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `n / 5 - 7`, `ans` is `ans + (g / 5 + 1)`, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 6.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 4. So, `g` becomes `n / 5 - 3 - 4`, simplifying to `n / 5 - 7`. The states of the other variables (`count`, `countmins`, `ans`, and `m`) are not affected.
