Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0) + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is now `n / 2 - 0`, and `g` is equal to `countmins`.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 0. Therefore, `g` becomes `n / 2 - 0`, which simplifies to `n / 2`. Since `g` was originally `n / 2`, subtracting `countmins` (which is 0) does not change its value. The condition `if g < countmins` would not be met because `g` is equal to `countmins`. Thus, no break statement is triggered, and the other variables remain unchanged.
