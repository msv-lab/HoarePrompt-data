Postcondition: `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, and `g` is `n / 4`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the values of `count`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged if the condition `g < countmins` is not met.
