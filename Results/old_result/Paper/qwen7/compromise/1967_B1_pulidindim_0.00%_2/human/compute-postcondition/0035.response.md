Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their values:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
2. `i` is 0.
3. `n` is an integer from the input split.
4. `m` must be at least 5.
5. `count` is `m + 1`.
6. `ans` is calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   ans = n + \left(\frac{n}{3} - 0\right) / 3 + 1 + \left(\frac{n}{5} - 1\right) / 6 + 2 + \left(\frac{n}{7} - 2\right) / 8 + \ldots + \left(\frac{n}{count} - (count-3)\right) / count + (count-3)
   \]
7. `countmins` is `count - 3`.
8. `g` is calculated as `n / (count - 1) - (count - 3)`.

Given the formula for `ans`, it involves a series of additions and divisions based on the value of `n` and `count`. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` in terms of `n` and `count`.

The final value of `ans` is derived from the initial value of `n` plus a series of incremental adjustments based on the formula provided. Each term in the series is calculated as follows:
- For each `count` from 2 to `m`, `ans` is incremented by `g / count + 1`, where `g` is adjusted in each iteration.

Given the complexity of the formula, the exact value of `ans` depends on the specific value of `n` and `m`. However, we can represent the final value of `ans` in a general form.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value calculated using the provided formula with n and m as defined in the initial state)**
