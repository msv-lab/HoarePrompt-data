Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / count - countmins`.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated by subtracting `countmins` from its current value. Since `countmins` is 0, `g` is now `n / count`. All other variables remain unchanged.
