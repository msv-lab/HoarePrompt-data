State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments with each iteration.
2. The loop condition `for i in range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times if `t` is a positive integer.
3. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` is within this range for the loop to execute.
4. The initial value of `i` is 0, as specified by the `range(t)` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is within the valid range and `i` starts at 0.
