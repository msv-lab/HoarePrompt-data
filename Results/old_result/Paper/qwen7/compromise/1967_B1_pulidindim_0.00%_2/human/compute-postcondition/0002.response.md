Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
