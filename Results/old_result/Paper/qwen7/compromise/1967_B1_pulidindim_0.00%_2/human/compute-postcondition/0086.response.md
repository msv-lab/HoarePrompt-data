Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / 2 - 0`.**

Explanation: The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Initially, `count` was 2, so after executing this line, `count` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
