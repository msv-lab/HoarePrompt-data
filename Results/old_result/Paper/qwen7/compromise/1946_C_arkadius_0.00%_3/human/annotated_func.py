    #  - If \( tree.vertices[u].remaining_size \geq x \), then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be incremented by 1.

It processes the tree structure to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex, reflecting the cumulative count of good components and the total remaining size of all descendant components for the starting vertex `s`. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the number of good components for vertex `s` and the remaining size of all its descendant components.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes a tree structure to determine the number of "good components" and their sizes. A "good component" is defined as a subtree where the remaining size (number of vertices) is greater than or equal to a given minimum size `x` after removing exactly `k` edges. The function returns two values: `good_components`, which is the total count of such good components, and `remaining_size`, which is the cumulative size of these components. The function recursively traverses the tree, updating these counts based on the properties of each subtree.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree represented as `tree`, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to remove (with 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5), and an integer `x` representing the desired size of the connected components after removing `k` edges. It calls another function `func_1` to determine the number of good components and their remaining size. If the number of good components is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

    #State: Output State: `beg` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `mid` is an integer. After all iterations of the loop, `beg` will be equal to `end`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `beg` and `end` until they converge, with `beg` being incremented and `end` being decremented based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. The final value of `mid` will be the same as `beg` and `end`, calculated as (`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1 when `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true, or `beg` will be set to `mid` and `end` will be adjusted accordingly until they meet.
    return beg
    #The program returns the integer value of `mid` which is the same as both `beg` and `end` after they converge.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree structure), an integer n representing the number of vertices in the tree, and an integer k representing the number of edges to be removed (with 1 ≤ k < n). It uses a binary search approach to find an integer value of `mid` which is the same as both `beg` and `end` once they converge. The function returns this integer value, which represents a specific condition related to the tree and the number of edges to be removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and tree is an object representing the tree structure where methods like add_edge and root_tree_non_recursive are available.

    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all `k` edges have been added to the tree. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and the tree will have `k` edges added between pairs of nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`, where `u` and `v` are integers obtained from input.

    #This is printed: func_4(tree, n, k) (where func_4 returns a value related to the tree with n nodes and k edges)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `k` to remove from the tree, constructs the tree structure, adds `k` edges to the tree based on user input, roots the tree, and then calls another function `func_4` to compute and return a value related to the modified tree.
