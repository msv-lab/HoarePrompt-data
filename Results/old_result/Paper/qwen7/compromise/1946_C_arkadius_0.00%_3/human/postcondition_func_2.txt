The function accepts a tree represented as `tree`, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to remove (with 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5), and an integer `x` representing the desired size of the connected components after removing `k` edges. It calls another function `func_1` to determine the number of good components and their remaining size. If the number of good components is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
