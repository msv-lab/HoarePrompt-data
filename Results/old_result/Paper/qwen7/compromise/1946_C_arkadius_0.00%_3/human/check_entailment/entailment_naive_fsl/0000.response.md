Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` do not accurately calculate the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3 1
1 2
1 3
```

The tree looks like this:
```
   1
  / \
 2   3
```

The correct answer should be 2 because after removing the edge between 1 and either 2 or 3, we get two connected components of sizes 1 and 2. However, the program incorrectly returns 3, which is not possible since removing one edge cannot result in a component of size 3.

The issue lies in how the functions handle the calculation of `good_components` and `remaining_size`. The logic in these functions does not properly account for the removal of edges and the resulting sizes of the connected components. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
