### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k`.
   - It constructs a tree using the given edges.

2. **Tree Class and Methods:**
   - The `Tree` class is used to represent the tree structure.
   - The methods `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and others are used to build and manipulate the tree.

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - **`func_1`:** This function aims to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing some edges. However, the logic inside this function does not correctly implement the problem requirements.
     - The function uses a post-order traversal but does not correctly handle the removal of edges.
   - **`func_2`:** This function recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for a subtree.
     - It should be used to check if a subtree can be a good component.
   - **`func_3`:** This function checks if the current value of `x` allows for the removal of `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
     - The logic here is flawed because it uses `func_1` which is incorrectly implemented.
   - **`func_4`:** This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
     - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
   - **`func_5`:** This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Implementation of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges, but it does not correctly simulate the removal of edges.
   - It uses a post-order traversal but does not update the tree structure to reflect the removal of edges.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` in `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` uses `func_1` to check if a given `x` is feasible, but since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_3` will also produce incorrect results.

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic in `func_4` is correct in principle but relies on the incorrect implementation of `func_3`.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code

1. **`func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly simulate the removal of edges. It only updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes without actually removing the edges from the tree.

2. **`func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to recursively calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for a subtree.
   - It correctly simulates the traversal and calculation but does not remove edges.

3. **`func_3` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_3` uses `func_1` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_3` will also produce incorrect results.

4. **`func_4` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
   - Since `func_3` relies on `func_1`, which is incorrect, `func_4` will also produce incorrect results.

5. **`func_5` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.
   - Since `func_4` is incorrect, `func_5` will also produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the overall program will not produce the correct results for the given problem.
