### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to understand why the original assessment might be incorrect.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex in the tree.
- It uses a post-order traversal to ensure that all child components are processed before updating the parent's attributes.
- The logic seems correct in terms of updating the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes based on the conditions provided.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function is a recursive helper function for `func_1`.
- It correctly calculates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for subtrees.
- The logic here also appears to be sound.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.
- It uses the results from `func_1` to make this determination.
- The logic here is correct in terms of checking the conditions for `good_components` and `remaining_size`.

#### Function `func_4`:
- This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
- It correctly uses the `func_3` function to perform the binary search.
- The logic here is sound.

#### Function `func_5`:
- This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.
- The overall flow of the program is correct.

#### Overall Program Flow:
- The program reads the input, constructs the tree, and then uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
- Each function is designed to work together to achieve the goal of finding the maximum `x`.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment stated that the program fails due to issues in handling the calculation of `good_components` and `remaining_size`, but upon closer inspection, the logic in these functions seems to be correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is likely incorrect. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description.
