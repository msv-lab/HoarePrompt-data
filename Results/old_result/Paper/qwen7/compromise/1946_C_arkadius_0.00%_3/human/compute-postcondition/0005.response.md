Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `u` is an input integer
   - `v` is an input integer
   - An edge is added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 2.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to execute again.

6. **Keep other states unchanged**: The states of `u`, `v`, and the edge addition in the tree do not change based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, an edge is added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree**.
