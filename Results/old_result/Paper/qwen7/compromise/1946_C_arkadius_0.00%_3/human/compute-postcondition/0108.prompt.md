Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` contains the tuple `(s, False)`, `tree` is an instance of a custom `Tree` class representing the tree structure, `s` is the starting vertex (an integer), and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing the specified number of edges.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `v` is an integer, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be incremented based on the following rules:
- For each child `u` of vertex `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be incremented by 1.
- If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be incremented by 1 plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.
- Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be updated by adding `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` whenever `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The `tree.vertices[v].good_components` attribute will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of vertex `v`, plus one for each child `u` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` attribute will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of vertex `v`. The state of all other attributes and the structure of the tree will remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After all iterations of the loop, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all child vertices `u` of `v`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all child vertices `u` of `v` that have `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` less than `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
