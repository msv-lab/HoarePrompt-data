Functionality: **The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree structure), an integer n representing the number of vertices in the tree, and an integer k representing the number of edges to be removed (with 1 â‰¤ k < n). It uses a binary search approach to find an integer value of `mid` which is the same as both `beg` and `end` once they converge. The function returns this integer value, which represents a specific condition related to the tree and the number of edges to be removed.**
