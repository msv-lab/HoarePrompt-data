Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, for every vertex \( v \) in the tree:

- `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be the total count of good components for all child vertices \( u \) of \( v \). A good component is defined as a connected component with a remaining size greater than or equal to \( x \). Specifically, for each child \( u \):
  - If \( tree.vertices[u].remaining_size \geq x \), then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be incremented by 1.
  - Otherwise, it will be incremented by 1 plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.

- `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all child vertices \( u \) of \( v \).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, for any given vertex \( v \):

- `tree.vertices[v].good_components` reflects the cumulative count of good components among all its descendants, considering the threshold \( x \).
- `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` represents the total remaining size of all its descendant components.
