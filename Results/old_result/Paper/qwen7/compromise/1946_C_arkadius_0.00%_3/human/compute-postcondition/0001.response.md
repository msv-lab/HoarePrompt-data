Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and a `Tree` object with `n` vertices has been created.**

Explanation: The code creates a `Tree` object with `n` vertices. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The `Tree` object is now part of the current state, indicating that a tree structure with `n` vertices has been initialized.
