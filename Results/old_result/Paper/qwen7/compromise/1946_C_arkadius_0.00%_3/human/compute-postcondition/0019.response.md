Output State: **`beg` is `mid`, `end` is an integer, and `mid` is (`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The value of `beg` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The value of `end` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The expression for `mid` is still valid and is defined as (`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1.
