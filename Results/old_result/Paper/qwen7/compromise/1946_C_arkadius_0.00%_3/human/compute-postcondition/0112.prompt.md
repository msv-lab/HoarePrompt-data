You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `tree` is an instance of a custom `Tree` class representing the tree structure, `s` is the starting vertex (an integer), and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing the specified number of edges.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, for every vertex \( v \) in the tree:
    #
    #- `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be the total count of good components for all child vertices \( u \) of \( v \). A good component is defined as a connected component with a remaining size greater than or equal to \( x \). Specifically, for each child \( u \):
    #  - If \( tree.vertices[u].remaining_size \geq x \), then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be incremented by 1.
    #  - Otherwise, it will be incremented by 1 plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.
    #
    #- `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all child vertices \( u \) of \( v \).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes, for any given vertex \( v \):
    #
    #- `tree.vertices[v].good_components` reflects the cumulative count of good components among all its descendants, considering the threshold \( x \).
    #- `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` represents the total remaining size of all its descendant components.
    return tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size
    #The program returns the tuple containing the number of good components for vertex `s` and the remaining size of all its descendant components.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a `Tree` object `tree`, an integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing specified edges. It returns a tuple containing the number of good components for vertex `s` and the remaining size of all its descendant components.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the tuple containing the number of good components for vertex `s` and the remaining size of all its descendant components.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
