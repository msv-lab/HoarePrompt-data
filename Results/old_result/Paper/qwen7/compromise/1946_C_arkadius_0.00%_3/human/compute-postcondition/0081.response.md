Output State: **stack contains ((next_u, False), (u, False))**

Explanation: The initial state of the stack contains `(next_u, False)`. The code snippet `stack.append((u, False))` appends a new tuple `(u, False)` to the stack. Therefore, the stack now contains both `(next_u, False)` and `(u, False)`.
