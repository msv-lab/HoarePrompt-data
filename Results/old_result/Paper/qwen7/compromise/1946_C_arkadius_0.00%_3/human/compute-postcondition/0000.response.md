Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and the values of `n` and `k` are input integers.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the lists `[n, k]`. Since these values are read from the input, they are now specific integers, but their exact values are not known until the input is provided. However, we know that `n` and `k` represent the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. The tree object and its methods remain unchanged.
