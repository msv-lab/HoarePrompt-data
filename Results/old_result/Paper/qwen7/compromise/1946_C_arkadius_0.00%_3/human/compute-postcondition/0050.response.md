Output State: The stack will contain tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `stack` will include every vertex in the subtree starting from `v`, each represented as a tuple where the first element is the vertex and the second element is initially set to `False`. The exact order in the stack will follow the order in which the vertices were pushed into it during the loop's iterations, which corresponds to a depth-first traversal of the subtree starting from `v`.
