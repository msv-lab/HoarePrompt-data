Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `v` is `s`, `tree.vertices[s].children` contains all children of vertex `s`, and the stack contains a series of tuples `(u, False)` where each `u` is a child of `s`. This means that every child of `s` has been pushed onto the stack exactly once, starting from the first child and continuing through all of `s`'s children, and the postorder traversal has started.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`; `v` is `s`, `tree.vertices[s].children` contains all children of vertex `s`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either 1 (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`) or `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`). Additionally, `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged in both cases. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is only increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'` when `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by 1 if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, otherwise it is increased by 1 plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`. `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is only increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. After executing the if-else block, `u` is set to the next child of `tree.vertices[v]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
