You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. The specific sequence of these outputs depends on the values of `b` and `c` entered during each iteration. Since the initial value of `t` does not affect the loop itself, the output state will be determined solely by the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of pairs of positive integers \(b\) and \(c\) (where \(1 \leq b, c \leq 100\)) based on a given count \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)). For each pair, it prints 'YES' if \(b\) equals \(c\), 'NO' if \(b\) is less than \(c\), 'Yes' if both \(b\) and \(c\) have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `a` times, reading pairs of integers `(b, c)` for each test case.

2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the program prints 'YES'. This condition checks if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes, which is logically correct.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints 'NO'. This condition checks if the number of moves is insufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes, which is also correct.
   - If `b` is greater than `c` and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program prints 'Yes'. This condition checks if the number of moves is sufficient and the parity matches, which is correct because adding or removing cubes alternately will maintain the parity.
   - Otherwise, the program prints 'No'. This covers all other cases where the conditions above do not hold, ensuring a comprehensive check.

### Testing the Conditions:

- **Case 1**: `b = 3`, `c = 3`
  - `b == c`: True, so the program prints 'YES'.
- **Case 2**: `b = 2`, `c = 4`
  - `b < c`: True, so the program prints 'NO'.
- **Case 3**: `b = 5`, `c = 3`
  - `b > c` and both `b` and `c` have different parities, so the program prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the given test cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
