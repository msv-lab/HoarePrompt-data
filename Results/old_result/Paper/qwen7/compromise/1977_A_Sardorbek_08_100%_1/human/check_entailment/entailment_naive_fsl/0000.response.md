Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of moves `b` is odd and the desired number of cubes `c` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, the parity (odd or even nature) of `b` and `c` should be the same for it to be possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves. However, the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' when `b % 2 == c % 2`, which is always true for the given examples but fails in other cases. For instance, if `b = 3` (odd) and `c = 4` (even), the program should print 'No', but it prints 'Yes'.
