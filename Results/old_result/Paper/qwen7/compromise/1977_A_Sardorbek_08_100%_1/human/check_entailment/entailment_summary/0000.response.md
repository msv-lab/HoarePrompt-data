Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly \(m\) cubes after \(n\) moves.
2. The provided solution checks several conditions but does not correctly implement the logic required for the problem.

Let's analyze the conditions in the code:
- If \(b\) (number of moves) equals \(c\) (desired number of cubes), it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, it means every move added a cube.
- If \(b\) is less than \(c\), it prints 'NO'. This condition is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- The condition `if b % 2 == c % 2` checks if both \(b\) and \(c\) have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, this alone is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the result. The key point is whether the difference between \(b\) and \(c\) is even or odd, since each move changes the parity of the number of cubes.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the difference between \(b\) and \(c\) is even. If the difference is even, it means we can achieve \(c\) cubes after \(b\) moves; if the difference is odd, it's impossible.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
