State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `a`, and the implicit variable `range(a)`.
2. The loop will execute if `a` is a non-negative integer and greater than 0 (since `range(a)` generates numbers from 0 to `a-1`).
3. Before the loop starts, `i` must be initialized to 0, as `range(a)` starts counting from 0.
4. The value of `t` (which is given to be between 1 and 100) does not affect the loop's execution condition directly, but it is mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must be a non-negative integer and greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**
