Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not compute the product of the array elements before taking the remainder. Instead, it attempts to append elements to the list `b` based on the direction ('L' or 'R') specified in the commands, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Compute the product of the remaining elements modulo m
        for j in range(i):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        # Append the result of the product modulo m
        ans.append(product)
        # Process the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return ans
```

This corrected version ensures that the product of the remaining elements is computed and taken modulo `m` at each step, and then the appropriate array element is removed based on the command.
