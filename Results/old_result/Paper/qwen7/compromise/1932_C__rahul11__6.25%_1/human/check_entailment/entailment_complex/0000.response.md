Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.
3. It initializes an array `res` to store the results.
4. The product `ans` is initially set to the product of all elements in `a`.
5. The program iterates through the string `s` and updates `ans` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
6. For each command, it calculates the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in `res`.
7. The loop correctly handles the removal of elements from `arr` based on the commands in `s`.
8. Finally, it prints the results stored in `res`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic and steps taken by the program match the requirements. The program correctly processes each test case and computes the required remainders at each step.

Correctness: **True**
