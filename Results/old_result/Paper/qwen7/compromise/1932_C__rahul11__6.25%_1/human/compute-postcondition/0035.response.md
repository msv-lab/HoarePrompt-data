Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is the same as before, `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` updates the value of `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. Specifically, `k` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, and `res[c]` is now set to `ans % m % MOD`. The condition `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L' and `c` is increased by 1 also hold true as per the initial conditions and the code snippet provided.
