Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input within this range, `m` is the second integer input within this range, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string.**

The code `s = list(input())` takes a new input string and converts it into a list of characters. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
