Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is increased by 1, `r` and `arr` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain in their previous states.
