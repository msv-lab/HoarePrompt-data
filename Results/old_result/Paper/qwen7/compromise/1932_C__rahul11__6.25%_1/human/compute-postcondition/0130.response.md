Output State: **`res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is the value of `ans` divided by `arr[r]` and then modulo `MOD`, `k` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L'.**

This means that the value of `res[c]` is updated to be the result of `ans % m % MOD`. The other variables retain their previous states.
