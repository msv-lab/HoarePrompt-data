Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
