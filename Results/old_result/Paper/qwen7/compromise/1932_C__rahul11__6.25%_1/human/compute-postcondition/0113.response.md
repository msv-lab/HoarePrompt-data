Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `ans` is multiplied by the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the variable `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the provided context, it is assumed to be the first element of the list `arr` (as per the initial state condition that `arr` must contain at least one element). The other variables remain unchanged.
