Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is an integer, `k` is `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**

This means that the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, `ans` has been updated to the result of `ans` divided by `arr[l]` (using integer division) and then taken modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` remains an integer, `k` has been incremented by 1, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `k + 1` still holds true.
