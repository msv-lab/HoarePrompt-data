Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `ans` is multiplied by the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `i` is not defined elsewhere in the given context, it is assumed to be the first element of `arr` (as `arr` must have at least one element). The other variables remain unchanged.
