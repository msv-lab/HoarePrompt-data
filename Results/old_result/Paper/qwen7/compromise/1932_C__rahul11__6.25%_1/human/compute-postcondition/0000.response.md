Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `MOD` is 10 ** 9 + 6.**

The code initializes the constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 6`. This value does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
