Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`. Since `ans` was previously updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` now holds the value of `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables (`k`, `n`, `arr`, `l`, `r`, `s`, `c`, `m`, `MOD`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
