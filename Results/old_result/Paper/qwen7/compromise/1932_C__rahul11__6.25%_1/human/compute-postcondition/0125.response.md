Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` after performing the operation `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `k` is an index within the string `s`, the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', and `arr[l]` and `MOD` are unchanged from their previous values.**

Note: The values of `ans`, `arr[l]`, and `MOD` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unchanged. The character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', and `k` itself remains an index within the string `s`.
