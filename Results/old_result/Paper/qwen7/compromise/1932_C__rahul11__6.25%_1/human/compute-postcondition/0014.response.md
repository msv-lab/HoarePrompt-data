Output State: **`res[0]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is equal to the product of all elements in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to `res[0]`. Here, `ans` is initially equal to the product of all elements in `arr`. After executing the code, `res[0]` holds the value of `ans` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, while `ans` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
