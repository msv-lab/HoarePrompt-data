Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. It does not affect the values of `k`, `n`, `res[c]`, `l`, `r`, or `c` directly. The value of `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L'. `c` is increased by 1. The value of `ans` is updated based on its current value and `arr[l]`. All other variables retain their previous states.
