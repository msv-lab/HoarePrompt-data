Postcondition: `ans` is the value of `ans` after performing either `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` (if `s[k] == 'L'`) or `ans = ans // arr[r-1] % MOD` (if `s[k] != 'L'`). `res[c]` is the value of `ans % m % MOD`. `k` is an index within the string `s`, and `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`. The character at index `k` in string `s` is either 'L' or not 'L', and `arr[r-1]` remains unchanged from its previous value.
