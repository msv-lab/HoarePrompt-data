Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1, and the value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is calculated as `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, and `res[c]` is set to the new value of `ans % m % MOD`. The condition for the loop to continue (`k < n - 1`) and the actions to be taken (increasing or decreasing `l` or `r` based on `s[k]`) remain the same.
