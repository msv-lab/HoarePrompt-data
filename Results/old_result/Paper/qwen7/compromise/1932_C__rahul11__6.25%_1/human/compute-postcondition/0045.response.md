Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[r]` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. However, the values of `ans`, `arr[r]`, and `MOD` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans` after the operation. The variables `k` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
