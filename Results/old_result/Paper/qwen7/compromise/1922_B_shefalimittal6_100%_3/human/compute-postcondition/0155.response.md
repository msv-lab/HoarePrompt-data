Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`, `cnt` will be the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` will be the sum of certain combinations of elements in `v` based on the conditions given, and `n` will remain unchanged.

To elaborate, `cnt` accumulates the sum of all elements in `v` as the loop iterates through each index from 0 to `n`. For each iteration, if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated by adding the combination formula `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to it. If `v[i]` is only greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it. The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations.
