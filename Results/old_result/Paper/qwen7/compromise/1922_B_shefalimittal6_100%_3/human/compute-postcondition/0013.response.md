Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. However, the initial values of `v`, `x`, `n`, and `idx` are not specified. We know that `n` must be greater than 0 and `idx` is increased by 1, but we cannot determine the exact value of `v[x]` without knowing the initial value of `v[x]` or the value of `x`. Therefore, we only update the value of `v[x]` to reflect the increment operation.
