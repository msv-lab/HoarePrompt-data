Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is equal to the initial value of `idx` plus `n`, `v[data[idx-1]]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` is assigned the value of `data[idx-1]` and `n` is the number of iterations, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if v[i] >= 2:
        ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
    if v[i] >= 3:
        ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
    cnt += v[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is in the range `[0, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further increased by `cnt * v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) // 2 + v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) * (v[i + 1] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i + 1]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is in the range `[2, n + 1)`, and `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. The value of `cnt` is now `cnt + v[i]`. The value of `ans` is now `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. The conditions for adjusting `ans` based on `v[i + 1]` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
