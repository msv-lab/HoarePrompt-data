Output State: **`results` contains a string representation of `ans` appended to it, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`, and `ans` is updated according to the formulae provided in the loop body for each `i` in the same range.**

This means that the `results` list now includes a new element which is the string representation of `ans`. The `cnt` variable has been incremented by the value of `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`, and `ans` has been updated according to the specified formulae within the loop for each `i` in the same range.
