Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n` inclusive, so `i` ranges from `0` to `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop:**
   - `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`.
   - `i` is in the range `[0, n + 1)`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
   - If `v[i]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was in the range `[0, n + 1)`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will now be in the range `[1, n + 1)`.

4. **Update the states:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is an external condition and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final state after adjusting:**
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `cnt` and `v[i + 1]`.

Given these points, the final state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i + 1]`, `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) // 2 + v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) * (v[i + 1] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i + 1]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.**
