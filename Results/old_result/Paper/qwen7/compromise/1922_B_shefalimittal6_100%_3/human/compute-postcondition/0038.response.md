Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6`
   - `idx` is 3 + n
   - `cnt` is 1
   - `i` is 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains the same, so `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 (since `i` is now 3).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` becomes 3
- `n` must remain greater than or equal to 3

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6`, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
