Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` remains unchanged, and if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, then `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
