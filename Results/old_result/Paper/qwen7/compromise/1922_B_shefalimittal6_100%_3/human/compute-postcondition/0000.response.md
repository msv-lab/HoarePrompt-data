Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This changes how input is read from the standard input, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the constraints and values of these variables remain unchanged.
