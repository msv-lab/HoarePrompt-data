Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `idx` is increased by 1.**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `idx` has been incremented by 1, while `n` still must be greater than or equal to 1.
