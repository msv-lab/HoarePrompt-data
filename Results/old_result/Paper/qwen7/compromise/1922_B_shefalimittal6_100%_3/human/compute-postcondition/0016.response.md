Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1.**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the value of `x` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `idx`.
