Output State: `ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for each `i` where `v[i] >= 2`, plus the sum of `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for each `i` where `v[i] >= 3`, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `n + 1`.

In this final state, `ans` accumulates contributions from each element in the list `v` based on its value. For each element `v[i]` that is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` is added to `ans`. Similarly, for each element `v[i]` that is greater than or equal to 3, `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` is added to `ans`. The variable `cnt` increments by the value of `v[i]` at each iteration, reaching a total of `n + 1` after the loop completes. The index `i` will be `n + 1` after the last iteration, and `idx` remains unchanged at `3 + n`.
