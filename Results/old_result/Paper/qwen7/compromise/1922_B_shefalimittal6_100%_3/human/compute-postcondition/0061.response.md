Output State: **`t` is now max(0, t-1), `n` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v` is a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is decremented by 1 if it was greater than 0, so `t` is now `max(0, t-1)`.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is assigned from `data[idx]` but no operation is performed on it within the given code snippet.
- The variable `idx` is increased by 1.
- A new list `v` is created with a length of `n + 1` and filled with zeros.
