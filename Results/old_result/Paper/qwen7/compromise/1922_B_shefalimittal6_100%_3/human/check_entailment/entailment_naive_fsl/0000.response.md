Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. However, it does not check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 1
```

The program will output `3` because it counts all combinations of three sticks, but it does not check if they can form a triangle. In this case, the combination (1, 1, 2) cannot form a non-degenerate triangle since \(1 + 1 \not> 2\).

To fix this, the program needs to include a check for the triangle inequality theorem. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        
        ans = 0
        for combo in combinations(range(n + 1), 3):
            if v[combo[0]] > 0 and v[combo[1]] > 0 and v[combo[2]] > 0:
                a, b, c = sorted(combo)
                if a + b > c:
                    ans += v[a] * v[b] * v[c]
        
        results.append(str(ans))
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected version uses `combinations` from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three stick lengths and checks if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem before counting them.
