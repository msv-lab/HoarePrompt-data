Precondition: **k and q are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; p is a list of k positive integers representing the sequence a where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100; qs is a list of q positive integers representing n_i where 1 <= n_i <= 100; n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.**

Note: The actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided in the given code snippet, but the precondition describes the expected types and ranges of the variables involved in the function calls within `func_2`.
