Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `qs` is a list of integers from the new input string.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` is empty).
   - `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `t` times. For each iteration, it processes an element from the list `qs`.

4. **Adjusting States**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the state directly, we focus on the elements that change within the loop.

5. **Variables in Loop Head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `t` and `_`. However, since `_` is just a placeholder, we consider `t` as the key variable that determines how many times the loop will run.

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - `qs`: Remains the same unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `qs` remains unchanged.
   - `n`: Will be updated to the next element in `qs` if `qs` has more elements. If `qs` is empty, `n` will remain undefined.
   - `res`: This list will be populated with the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`. After the loop, `res` will contain the results for all elements processed.

7. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed. If `t` is 1, then after one iteration, `t` should be 0 for the loop to stop.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `qs` remains the same.
- `n` becomes the second element of `qs` if `qs` has more than one element, or remains undefined if `qs` has only one element or is empty.
- `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for the elements processed so far.

Since the exact value of `n` and `res` depend on the loop body, we can only adjust `t` to ensure the loop continues.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`qs` is a list of integers from the new input string, `n` is the second element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` has fewer than 2 elements), `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to the first element of `qs`**, and `t` is reduced by 1.
