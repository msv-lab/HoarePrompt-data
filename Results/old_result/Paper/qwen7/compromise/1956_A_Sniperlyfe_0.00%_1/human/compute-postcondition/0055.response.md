Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of inputs. Each set includes positive integers `k` and `q`, a list `p` of `k` positive integers, and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and stores the result in a list `res`. Finally, it prints the elements of `res` for each set of inputs.**
