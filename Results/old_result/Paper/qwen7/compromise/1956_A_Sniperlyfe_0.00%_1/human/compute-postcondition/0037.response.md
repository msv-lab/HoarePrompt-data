Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers from the new input string, `n` is the second element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` has fewer than 2 elements), `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to the first element of `qs`, `k` is an integer from the input split, `q` is an integer from the input split**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `k` and `q` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values are assigned to the variables `k` and `q`. The other variables (`qs`, `n`, `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
