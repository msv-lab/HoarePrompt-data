Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string and converted to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with all elements remaining) and now `qs` is updated to be the list of integers from the new input string, `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n in qs:
    res.append(func_1(n, p))
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `qs` is a list of integers from the new input string that must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `qs` must have at least zero elements, `n` is the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements, otherwise `n` is undefined, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `qs` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
