Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers from the new input string that must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `n` is the first element of `qs`, and `p` is an unspecified parameter, the value of `res` is updated accordingly. The initial state of `qs` and `n` remains unchanged, and `res` now contains the result of the function call.
