Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains as the initial input, `k` and `q` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers as initially provided, `qs` is an empty list, and `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the original `qs`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` which controls the number of iterations remains the same as the initial input. The values of `k` and `q` also remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `p` retains its initial values as provided. The list `qs` becomes empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `res` contains the results of applying the function `func_1(n, p)` to each `n` in the original `qs`.
