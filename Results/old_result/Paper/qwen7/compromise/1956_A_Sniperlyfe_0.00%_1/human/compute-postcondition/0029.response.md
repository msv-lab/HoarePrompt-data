Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `qs` has at least one element.
   - `n` is the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements; otherwise, `n` is undefined.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` must have at least zero elements.
   - `n` is the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements, otherwise `n` is undefined.
   - `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

4. **Determine the adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least one element.
   - `n` will be the next element in `qs`.
   - `res` will be updated with the new value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `qs` must have at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `n` will be the next element in `qs`.
   - `res` will be updated with the new value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `qs` must have at least one element, `n` is the next element in `qs`, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

However, since we need to provide a specific format, we can simplify it as follows:

**State: `qs` must have at least one element, `n` is the next element in `qs`, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**
