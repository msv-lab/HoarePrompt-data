### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of players) and `p` (the sequence of indices to remove players).
   - The function iterates while `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - In each iteration, it reduces `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - This process continues until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.
   - The function returns `n`, which is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer less than the minimum value in `p`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the lengths of the sequences `p` and `qs` respectively.
   - It then reads the sequence `p` and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Program Flow and Correctness:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game's rounds and determines the number of winners.
   - The program outputs the results in the required format.

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and performs the necessary operations correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
