### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the given program based on the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
- Each cell contains a character `<` or `>` indicating the direction the pinball should move.
- The pinball starts at each cell and moves according to the direction indicated by the cell's character.
- After each move, the direction of the cell is reversed.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

#### Given Functions Recap
1. **`func_1(arr, times)`**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and an adjusted index based on `times`.
   - Formula: `arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]`
   - This function is used to compute intermediate values needed in the main function.

2. **`func_2(s1, n)`**:
   - Initializes arrays `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`.
   - Iterates backward through the string `s1` and updates the `ans` array based on the direction of the pinball.
   - Handles both cases (`>` and `<`) and updates the `ans` array accordingly.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` stores positions where the direction is `>`.
   - `totalOne` counts the number of such positions.
   - `preOne` is an accumulated version of `pre`.
   - `suffZero` is a list to store suffix sums.
   - `ans` is initialized to `[0] * n`.

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - For each cell `i` (starting from `n-1` to `0`), the function checks the direction of the pinball.
   - If the direction is `>`, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the accumulated values.
   - If the direction is `<`, it calculates the time taken similarly but updates the `suffZero` list.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The function uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The use of accumulated values and suffix sums ensures that the calculations are correct and efficient.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the pinball might leave the grid quickly or take longer depending on the sequence of directions.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided example in the problem statement shows that the solution works for small examples.
   - The use of dynamic programming and accumulated values ensures that the calculations are correct.

#### Key Points to Validate
- The function correctly handles the reversal of directions and updates the `ans` array.
- The dynamic programming approach ensures that the calculations are efficient and correct.
- The logic for handling both `>` and `<` directions is sound.

#### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis and the provided example, the given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the necessary computations and updates correctly.
