Based on the initial state provided:

- `totalOne` is `0`
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `pre` is an empty list
- `preOne` is an empty list
- `suffZero` is a list of integers where each integer is the cumulative sum of indices of '<' up to that point in `s1`
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the contents of the `ans` list. Since the exact values of `ans` are not provided in the initial state, we need to consider how `ans` is populated during the loop execution. However, without the loop details, we can only describe `ans` in terms of its definition.

Given that `ans` is populated based on certain conditions inside the loop, and considering the nature of the problem, `ans` likely contains values derived from the string `s1` and possibly the lists `pre`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a list of n integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop involving the string s1 and other lists)**
