Output State: **`totalOne` is `len(pre)`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i+1 is the position index (1-indexed) of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of accumulated sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is `[0]`**.

Explanation: The line `suffZero = [0]` initializes a new list `suffZero` with a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, or `preOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
