### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initial Check for `n < k`:**
   - The program currently checks if `n < k` and prints "NO" without further processing. This part is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Handling `n == k`:**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" followed by 1 twice and returns the value of `n`. This is also correct as per the problem statement.

3. **General Case (`n > k`):**
   - The program initializes `costs` as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates over `costs` and calculates the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
   - If the sum is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the elements of `costs`.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function. It correctly states that if `n < k`, it prints "NO". If `n == k`, it prints "YES" followed by 1 twice. For `n > k`, it calculates the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` and prints "NO" if the sum is less than `k`. Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the elements of `costs`.

#### Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO".
- The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by printing "YES" followed by 1 twice.
- The general case where `n > k` is handled correctly by calculating the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` and printing "NO" if the sum is less than `k`. Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the elements of `costs`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and matches the function summary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary.
