### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles the cases where \( n \) (the number of coins Alice has) is equal to \( k \) (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy). In this case, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with the price of 1 coin per jewel.
   
2. **Case Where \( n < k \):**
   - If \( n \) is less than \( k \), the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy even one jewel, let alone \( k \) jewels.

3. **Case Where \( n \ge k \):**
   - The program attempts to set up stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - It initializes the list `costs` with the values \([n - k + 1, 1]\).
   - It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updates the total count (`h`).
   - If the total count of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) is less than \( k \), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of stalls (2 in this case), and the prices of the stalls.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( n \) is just slightly more than \( k \). For example, if \( n = k + 1 \), the program will set up 2 stalls with prices \([2, 1]\), ensuring Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - The program also correctly handles larger values of \( n \) and \( k \) within the constraints.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The output matches the expected format for both "YES" and "NO" cases.
   - The logic for setting up stalls and calculating the number of jewels Alice can buy is sound and adheres to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
