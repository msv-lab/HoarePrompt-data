Output State: **`costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is a positive integer.**

Explanation: The list `costs` is initialized with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, with the condition that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
