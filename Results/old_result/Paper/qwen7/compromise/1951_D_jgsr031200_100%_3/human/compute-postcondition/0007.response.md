Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers.
- Both `n` and `k` are within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- At the moment of execution, the value of `n` is less than `k`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **'NO'**
