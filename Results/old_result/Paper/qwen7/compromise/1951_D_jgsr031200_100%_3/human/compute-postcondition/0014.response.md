Output State: `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.

In this output state, the variable `h` is updated to be the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in the list `costs`. The list `costs` remains unchanged, and `n` is reduced according to the loop's logic but its exact value depends on the initial value of `n` and the values in `costs`.
