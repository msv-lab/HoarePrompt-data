Output State: **`length` is the length of the string `expression`, `count` is the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`, `sub` is the difference between `length` and `count`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of characters in the string `expression` (stored in `length`) and subtracts the number of '+' characters in the same string (stored in `count`). The result of this subtraction is stored in the variable `sub`. The initial values of `count` and `expression` remain unchanged.
