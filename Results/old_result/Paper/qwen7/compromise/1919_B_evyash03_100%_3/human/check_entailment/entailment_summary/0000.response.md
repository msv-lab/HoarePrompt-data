Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Counting '+' and '-' Characters**: The program correctly counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
2. **Calculating the Difference**: The program calculates the difference between the length of the string and the count of '+' characters.
3. **Returning the Penalty**: However, the program returns the absolute value of the difference between this calculated difference and the count of '+' characters. This is incorrect because the penalty should be calculated based on splitting the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero whenever possible.

To achieve the optimal solution, the program should aim to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero (i.e., equal number of '+' and '-' characters). If it's not possible to make the sum zero, the penalty for each segment should be calculated as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Given the example test cases, the program fails to produce the correct penalties. For instance, in the third test case, the optimal split would be `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of 0, but the program outputs 0 instead of correctly calculating the penalty.

Correctness: **False**
