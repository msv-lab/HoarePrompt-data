Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `length` and the string `expression`. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `expression` (a string of '+' and '-') and `length` (an integer).
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression` and stores this count in `count`.
   - It then calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of the string and the count of '+' characters.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1`:
- `count` is the number of '+' characters in the string.
- `sub` is the number of '-' characters in the string, since `sub = length - count`.
- The return value is `abs(sub - count)`, which simplifies to `abs(length - 2 * count)`.

Now, let's consider the problem statement and the examples provided:
- The goal is to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
- The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- If `count` is the number of '+' characters, then `length - count` is the number of '-' characters.

The function `func_1` essentially calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string. However, this does not directly give the minimum penalty. The optimal strategy involves splitting the array in such a way that the penalties of the subarrays are minimized.

To illustrate with an example:
- For the input `5 -----`, the string has 5 '-' characters and 0 '+' characters.
- The function calculates `abs(5 - 0) = 5`, but the correct minimum penalty is 5, as explained in the problem statement.

The function `func_1` does not account for the optimal splitting of the array. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty.

Final: **False**
