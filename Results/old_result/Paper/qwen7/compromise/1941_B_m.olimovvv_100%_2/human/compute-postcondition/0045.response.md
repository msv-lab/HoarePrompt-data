Output State: **`b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is inside. Therefore, the values of `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
