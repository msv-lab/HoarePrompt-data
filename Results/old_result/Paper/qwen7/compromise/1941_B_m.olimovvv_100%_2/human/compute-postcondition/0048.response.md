Output State: **`b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` updates the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting `2 * b[i]` from it. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged, so `b[i + 2]` is still decreased by `b[i]`, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the loop or if statement would break, but since no such condition is specified to occur here, we assume the loop continues.
