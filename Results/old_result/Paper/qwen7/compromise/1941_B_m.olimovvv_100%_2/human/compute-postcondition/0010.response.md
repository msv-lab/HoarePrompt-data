Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` must be at least 2, and `i` is 1; `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1), and `b[i + 1]` (which is `b[2]`) is updated by subtracting `2 * b[i]` (which is `2 * b[1]`). The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
