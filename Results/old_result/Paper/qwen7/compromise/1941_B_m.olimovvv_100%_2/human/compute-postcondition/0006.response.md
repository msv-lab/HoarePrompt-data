Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` must be at least 2.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `b[i]` is less than 0.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
