Output State: **`a` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `a` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, and `b[i + 1]` is set to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`. The code snippet modifies `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i]` from it. Since `i` is 1, `b[i + 2]` refers to `b[3]`. Therefore, `b[3]` is updated to `b[3] - b[1]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
