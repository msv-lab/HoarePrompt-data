Output State: `a` is greater than 5, `i` is 3, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 2]` is `b[4] - b[1]`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (4 times), `a` must be greater than 5 because the loop runs from `0` to `a-2`, so `a-2 = 3` implies `a > 5`. The value of `i` will be 3 since the loop increments `i` each iteration. At the end of the loop, `b[i]` (which is `b[3]`) is set to 0. Additionally, `b[i + 2]` (which is `b[5]` or `b[4]` based on zero-indexing) is updated by subtracting `b[1]` from it.
