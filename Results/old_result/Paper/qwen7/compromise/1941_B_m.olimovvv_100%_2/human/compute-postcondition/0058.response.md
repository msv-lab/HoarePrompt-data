Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i]` is `0`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, `b[i]` is `0`**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, which means `b[i]` will become 0. Since `b[i]` was already set to 0 before this line of code, it remains 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
