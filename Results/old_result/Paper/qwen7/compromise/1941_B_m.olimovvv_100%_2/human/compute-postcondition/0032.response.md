Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a - 2`, `b[3]` is 0, `b[4]` is equal to \(-6 \times (a-5)\), `b[5]` is equal to \(-6 \times (a-5)\), and all elements `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to 2 are 0.**

The code `a = int(input())` takes an input, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `b[3]`, `b[4]`, `b[5]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
