Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The solution checks if any element in the array is negative after the first pass through the loop, but this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made entirely zero. Instead, the solution should simulate the operations and check if it's possible to reduce all elements to zero.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the prefix sums
        prefix_sums = [0] * n
        prefix_sums[0] = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i]
        
        # Check if the total sum is zero
        if prefix_sums[-1] != 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the minimum prefix sum is non-negative
        min_prefix_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            min_prefix_sum = min(min_prefix_sum, prefix_sums[i])
            if min_prefix_sum < 0:
                print("NO")
                break
        else:
            print("YES")

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: We calculate the prefix sums of the array. This helps us understand the cumulative effect of the operations.
2. **Total Sum Check**: If the total sum of the array is not zero, it's impossible to make all elements zero, so we print "NO".
3. **Minimum Prefix Sum Check**: We iterate through the prefix sums and keep track of the minimum value. If at any point the minimum prefix sum is negative, it means we cannot make all elements zero, so we print "NO". Otherwise, we print "YES".

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operations.
