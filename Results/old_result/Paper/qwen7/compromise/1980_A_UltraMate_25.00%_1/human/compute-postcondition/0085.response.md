Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in p`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 'A'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEF'
   - If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` remains equal to `m`.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over each character in `p`, the next value of `i` will be the next character in the string `p`. Given that `i` was 'A' in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 'B'.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `p`. The string `p` does not change within the loop, so it remains 'ABCDEF'. The variable `i` changes to 'B'.

5. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` remains equal to `m`. However, since we are only asked to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to modify `hmp`, `ans`, or `m` unless explicitly stated.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
