Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 'B'
   - `hmp` remains an empty set or a set that does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F'
   - `ans` is increased by `m - hmp['B']` if `hmp['B'] < m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - The loop iterates over each key in `hmp`.
   - Since `i` was 'B' at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.
   - Given that `hmp` does not contain 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F', the next key `i` could be any other key in `hmp` (if it exists).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will change to the next key in `hmp`.
   - `hmp` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless `i` is 'B' and `hmp['B'] < m`, but since `i` is changing, this condition will be checked again for the new `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be the next key in `hmp` (which could be any key except 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F').
- `hmp` remains an empty set or a set that does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F'.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

Since we don't know the exact next key in `hmp`, we can represent it generically as `next_key`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is `next_key`, `hmp` remains an empty set or a set that does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F', `ans` remains unchanged**
