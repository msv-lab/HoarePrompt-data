Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, the function returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific parameters, and returns output based on those parameters without directly accepting them as function arguments.
