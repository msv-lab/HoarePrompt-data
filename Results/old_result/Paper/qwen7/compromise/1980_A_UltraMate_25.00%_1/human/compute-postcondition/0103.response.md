Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over all keys in the dictionary `hmp`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next key in `hmp`.
   - We need to find the next key in `hmp` for the next iteration.

4. **Consider the possible values of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is the next key in `hmp`, it means that `i` is the current key being processed in the loop.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` will change to the next key in `hmp`.
   - The value of `p` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The value of `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition `hmp[i] < m` is met, but since we are only asked to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to consider the value of `ans` changing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is the next key in `hmp`, `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
