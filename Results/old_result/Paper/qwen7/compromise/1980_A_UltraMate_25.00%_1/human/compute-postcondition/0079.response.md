Output State: **`i` is 'E', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the input integer from the user, `m` is the input integer from the user, `s` is the input string from the user, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and includes the keys 'F', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', the character 'i' is in the counter `hmp`.**

Explanation: The code `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a Counter object `hmp` that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. This operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `p`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged, and `hmp` is updated to count the characters in `s`.
