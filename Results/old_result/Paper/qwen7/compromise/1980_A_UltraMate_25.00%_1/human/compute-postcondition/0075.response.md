Output State: **`i` is 'E', `p` must be 'ABCDEF', `ans` is the sum of `0 + 6*m` minus the total number of characters in the string `s` that have a count less than `m`, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and includes the keys 'F', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', the character 'i' must be in the counter `hmp`, `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `m`. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
