Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases through its constraints, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and potentially `t`.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing `t`, `a`, and `b`, and returns a specific result for each case based on these inputs, without explicitly defining the return type or value in the given snippet.
