Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic of the game. The key issue lies in the condition used to determine the winner. Specifically, the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:` is incorrect for determining the winner based on the rules of the game.

According to the game rules:
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Players take turns removing one coin from their wallet until it is empty.
- If both players play optimally, the player whose turn it is when the wallets are equal (i.e., `a == b`) will lose because they will be forced to make the last move, leaving the opponent with an empty wallet.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This version checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, Bob will win because Alice will be forced to make the last move. Otherwise, Alice will win.
