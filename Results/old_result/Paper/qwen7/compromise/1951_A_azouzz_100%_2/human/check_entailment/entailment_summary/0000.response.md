Reasoning:
1. The given program consists of two separate functions: `generate_files_for_html_in_range` and `func_1`.
2. The execution summary describes the behavior of `func_1`, which is not related to the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.
3. The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is responsible for generating `.py` files in specific directories that contain `.html` files within a specified range.
4. The execution summary does not mention anything about generating files or checking for directories with `.html` files.
5. Since the execution summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1` but does not describe the behavior of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`, we cannot determine the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function based solely on the provided execution summary.

Given that the execution summary only pertains to `func_1` and does not provide information about the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, we cannot make a judgment on its correctness based on this summary alone.

Correctness: **False**
