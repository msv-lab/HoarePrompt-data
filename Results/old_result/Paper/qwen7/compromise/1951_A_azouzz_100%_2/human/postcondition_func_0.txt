The function reads multiple integer inputs `t` and for each of these inputs, it reads a string `s`. It then checks the count of '1's in each string `s`. Based on the count and presence of consecutive '1's, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses corresponding to the input strings `s`.
