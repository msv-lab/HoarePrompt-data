Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
