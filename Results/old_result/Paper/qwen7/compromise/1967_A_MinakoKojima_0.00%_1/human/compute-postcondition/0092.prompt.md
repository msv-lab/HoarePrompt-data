Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of type i initially.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, and `ans` is the initial value of `ans` (which is `a[0]`) multiplied by the product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, unless `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, in which case `ans` remains `math.factorial(n)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is either the factorial of `n` or the cumulative product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is the cumulative product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, and `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations, with the condition that `n` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is either `math.factorial(n)` if `k >= n * m`, or the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `i` is equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
