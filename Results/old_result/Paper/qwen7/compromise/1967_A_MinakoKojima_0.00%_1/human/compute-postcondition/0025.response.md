Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0] * (a[3] - a[2])`
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n`. Since `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0] * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
