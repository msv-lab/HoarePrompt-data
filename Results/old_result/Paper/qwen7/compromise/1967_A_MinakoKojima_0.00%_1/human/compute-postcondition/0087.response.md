Output State: **`ans` is equal to `ans * a[1] - a[0] * (a[3] - a[2]) * (a[4] - a[3])`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to its original value multiplied by `(a[4] - a[3])`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 4, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
