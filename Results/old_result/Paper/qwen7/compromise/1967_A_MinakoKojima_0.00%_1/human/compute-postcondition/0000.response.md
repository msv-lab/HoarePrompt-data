Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range of input values.
   - `input()`: This function call returns an integer value which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**: 
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Since `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), the input will always return a valid integer within this range.
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value returned by `int(input())`, which should match the value of `t`.

3. **Formulate the State**: 
   - We need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` matches the value of `t`. 

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` itself, ensuring that the loop will execute based on the input value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input to `int(input())` must equal `t`**
