To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n`: The first integer input split from the input string.
   - `k`: The second integer input split from the input string.
   - `a`: A list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `m`: The minimum value in the list `a`.
   - `ans`: Either the factorial of `n` or the cumulative product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`.
   - `i`: Equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is determined based on the comparison between `k` and `n * m`.

Given these details, let's analyze the possible scenarios for `ans`:

### Scenario 1: `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`
- In this case, `ans` is the factorial of `n`.
- The factorial of `n` is denoted as `n!`.

### Scenario 2: `k` is less than `n * m`
- In this case, `ans` is the cumulative product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not provided, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the problem specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, so we can proceed with the general form.

### Output:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is `n!`.
- If `k` is less than `n * m`, then `ans` is the cumulative product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`.

Since the exact values are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value of `ans`. Therefore, the output will be described in terms of the conditions given.

Output: **ans (where ans is the factorial of n if k >= n * m, otherwise the cumulative product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list a starting from index 1 up to n-1)**
