Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is 0, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code sets `ans` to 0, which overrides its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
