Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string.
   - `k` is decreased by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can continue if `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Hence, `n` remains the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Consider the value of `k`**:
   - The value of `k` is updated based on the previous iteration's values, but since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we do not need to explicitly state the updated value of `k`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string, `k` is decreased by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i + 1])`**.
