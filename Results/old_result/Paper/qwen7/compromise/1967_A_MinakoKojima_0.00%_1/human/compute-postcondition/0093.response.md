Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and a list `a` containing `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the given constraints and relationships between the inputs.**
