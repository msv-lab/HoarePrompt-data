Output State: `num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216, `idx` is 24.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k >= 1 << idx`. Given that `1 << idx` doubles with each iteration starting from `1 << 0 = 1`, after 24 iterations, `idx` will reach 24, and `1 << 24 = 16777216`. Therefore, the loop will stop when `k` is less than 16777216. Hence, after all iterations, `idx` will be 24, and `k` must be at least 16777216.
