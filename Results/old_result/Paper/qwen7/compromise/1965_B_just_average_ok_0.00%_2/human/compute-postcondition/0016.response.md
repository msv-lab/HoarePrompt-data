Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 with an additional element `k - nums[24]` and now includes `k + 1`, `idx` is 24, `nums` is updated to exclude `1 << idx`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 24, `1 << idx` is equivalent to `1 << 24`, which equals 16777216. So, the number 16777216 is removed from the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
