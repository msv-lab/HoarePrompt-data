Output State: `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 4.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << \text{idx}\). Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `idx` is now 3. Therefore, the condition for the loop to continue is `k >= 1 << 3`, which means `k` must be at least 8. After the loop finishes, `idx` will be incremented one more time to 4, and the loop will stop since `k` will no longer meet the condition `k >= 1 << 4`.
