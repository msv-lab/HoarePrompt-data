Output State: The loop will execute for each test case provided by the user. After all iterations, `num_tests` will be the total number of test cases processed, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000. For each test case, `n` will be the integer obtained from the first input split, and `k` will be an integer within the range 2 <= k <= n. The variable `nums` will be a list containing specific integers based on the value of `k` for each test case. Specifically, `nums` will include the powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, plus three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. After removing the largest power of 2 from the list, `nums` will contain exactly 25 elements. The variable `idx` will be set to the index of the largest power of 2 removed from the list, which will vary depending on the value of `k`.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, the output state will reflect the processing of all test cases, with `num_tests` indicating the total number of cases, `n` and `k` representing the parameters for each case, and `nums` being the final list of 25 integers for each case as described above.
