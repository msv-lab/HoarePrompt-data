Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\).
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split. This value is not relevant to the current print statement.
   - `k` is less than 16. This means `k` can be any integer from 0 to 15.
   - `nums` is a list containing the following elements:
     \[
     [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-15, k+17]
     \]
   - `idx` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*nums)
   ```

The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list `nums` and prints its elements separated by spaces.

Given the structure of `nums`, it contains a sequence of powers of 2 followed by two additional elements: `k-15` and `k+17`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the list `nums` printed with a space between each element.

Output: **2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304 8388608 [k-15] [k+17]**
