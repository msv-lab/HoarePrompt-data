Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 with an additional element `k - nums[24]` and now includes `k + 1`, `idx` is 24.**

Explanation: The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Initially, `nums` contains integers from 1 to 16777216 with an additional element `k - nums[24]`. After appending `k + 1`, the list `nums` now includes this new element. All other variables remain unchanged.
