Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
   - `k` must be at least 2.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216.
   - `idx` is 2.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `k >= 1 << idx` must be true. Given that `idx` is currently 2, the condition becomes `k >= 1 << 2`, which simplifies to `k >= 4`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `idx` is fixed at 2, no adjustment is needed for `idx`.
   - We need to ensure that `k` is at least 4 for the loop to continue. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` must be at least 2, but to ensure the loop continues, `k` must be at least 4.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is at least 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` must be at least 4, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216, `idx` is 2**
