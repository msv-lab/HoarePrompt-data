Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.

2. **Understand the loop head variables**: The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`.

3. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216.
   - `idx` is 1.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `k >= 1 << idx` must be true. Given that `idx` is currently 1, the condition becomes `k >= 1 << 1`, which simplifies to `k >= 2`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `idx` is currently 1, we need to check if `k` is at least 2. If `k` is less than 2, the loop cannot execute again.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `idx`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` must be at least 2, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216, `idx` is 1**
