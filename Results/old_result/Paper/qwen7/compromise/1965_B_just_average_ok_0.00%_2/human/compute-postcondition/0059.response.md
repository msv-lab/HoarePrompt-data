Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), and for each t, two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n) are provided. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for n and k within each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing values for t, n, and k. For each set of n and k values, the function determines the outcome based on the given constraints and returns the appropriate result for each test case.
