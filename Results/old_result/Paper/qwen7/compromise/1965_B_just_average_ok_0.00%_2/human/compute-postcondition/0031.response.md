Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 16, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 3.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `idx` being 3, while `num_tests`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` retain their initial values.
