Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 (which are powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\)), `idx` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `num_tests`, `n`, `k`, or `nums`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the new value of `idx`.
