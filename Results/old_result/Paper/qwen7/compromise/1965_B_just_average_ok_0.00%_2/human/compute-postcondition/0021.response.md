Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 0 < num_tests <= 999, `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608], `idx` is 24.**

Explanation: The code replaces the existing `nums` list with a new list generated using a list comprehension. The new `nums` list contains elements that are powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
