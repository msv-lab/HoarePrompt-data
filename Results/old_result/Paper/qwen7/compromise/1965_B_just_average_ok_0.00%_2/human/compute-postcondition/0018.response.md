Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **num_tests**: A positive integer where \(1 \leq \text{num\_tests} \leq 1000\).
2. **n**: An integer obtained from the first input split. This value is not relevant to the current code snippet.
3. **k**: At least 16777216.
4. **nums**: A list containing integers from 1 to 16777216, with an additional element `k - nums[24]` and now includes `k + 1`. This means initially, `nums` contains integers from 1 to 16777216, and then it has two extra elements: `k - nums[24]` and `k + 1`.
5. **idx**: 24.
6. **nums** is updated to exclude `1 << idx`, which is `1 << 24` or 16777216.

Given these details, let's reconstruct the `nums` list after the updates:

- Initially, `nums` contains integers from 1 to 16777216.
- After adding `k - nums[24]` and `k + 1`, the list becomes: `[1, 2, ..., 16777216, k - nums[24], k + 1]`.
- Finally, `16777216` (which is `1 << 24`) is removed from the list.

So, the final `nums` list is: `[1, 2, ..., 16777215, k - nums[24], k + 1]`.

When the `print(*nums)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the `nums` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 ... 16777215 [k - nums[24]] [k + 1]** (where `k` is at least 16777216 and `nums[24]` is one of the integers from 1 to 16777216).
