Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, it processes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). The function does not specify a direct return value in the given information, implying it might print or process results for each test case internally.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, and performs some operation based on these values, though the exact nature of the operation and the return value are not specified in the given information.
