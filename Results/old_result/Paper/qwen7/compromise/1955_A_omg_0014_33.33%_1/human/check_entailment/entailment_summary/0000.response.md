Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is correct according to the problem statement.
2. For each test case, the program reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. The program calculates the cost of buying \( n \) yogurts using the regular price (\( a \times b \)) and the promotional price (\( a \times \frac{c}{2} \)), where \( c \) is supposed to be \( b \) in this context.
4. However, the program uses an additional variable `d` that is assigned the value of \( \frac{c}{2} \) (which should be \( \frac{b}{2} \)), but it never actually uses this variable correctly in the comparison. Instead, it compares \( a \times b \) with \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \), which is not the intended logic.
5. The correct logic should compare the total cost of buying \( n \) yogurts at the regular price with the total cost of buying them using the promotion as much as possible.
6. The program should calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotional price and how many individual yogurts will be needed at the regular price.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the cost based on the promotion.

Correctness: **False**
