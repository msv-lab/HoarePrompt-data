### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Annotated Code:
- Before the function call, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\).
- For each test case, it calculates either \(a \times b\) or \(a \times \frac{c}{2}\) (where \(c\) is another integer read from input), and prints the result.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. Specifically, the program calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`b * (n // 2)`) and the remaining single yogurts at the regular price (`a * (n % 2)`).

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        pairs = c if c < 2 * a else 2 * a
        total_cost = (c if c < 2 * a else 2 * a) * (c // 2) + a * (n % 2)
        print(total_cost)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Original Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`.
   - This comparison is incorrect because `d` should represent the cost of two yogurts at the promotion price, which is `b`.

2. **Corrected Program Logic:**
   - The corrected program calculates the minimum cost by:
     - Determining the better price per pair of yogurts (`pairs`).
     - Calculating the total cost as the sum of the cost of pairs and the cost of the remaining single yogurts.

3. **Annotations and State Analysis:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after processing each test case.
   - The annotations confirm that the original program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. The corrected version provided in the original assessment is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
