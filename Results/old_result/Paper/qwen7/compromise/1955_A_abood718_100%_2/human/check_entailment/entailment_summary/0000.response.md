Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic used to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts is accurate according to the problem statement.

1. **Promotion Logic**: The promotion allows buying two yogurts for `b` burles instead of the regular price of `a` burles each.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than the price for one yogurt (`a`), it's always cheaper to buy in pairs.
   - If `n` is even, we can buy all yogurts in pairs, so the cost is \(\frac{n}{2} \times b\).
   - If `n` is odd, we can buy \(\frac{n-1}{2}\) pairs and one additional yogurt at the regular price, so the cost is \(\frac{n-1}{2} \times b + a\).

Let's break down the code to see if it correctly implements this logic:

- The loop iterates `t` times, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.
- It checks if `b * 2 < a`, which is a condition that should be `B * 2 < C` in the code. This condition determines if it's cheaper to buy in pairs.
- If the condition is true, it prints `A * B`, which is incorrect because it should be checking against `C` (the price for two yogurts).
- If the condition is false, it further checks if `A % 2 == 0`. If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the correct calculation for even `n`.
- If `A % 2 != 0`, it calculates the cost as `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.

The issue lies in the comparison condition `B * 2 < C` instead of `B * 2 < A`. Additionally, the logic for odd `n` is not entirely correct; it should account for the extra yogurt separately.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
