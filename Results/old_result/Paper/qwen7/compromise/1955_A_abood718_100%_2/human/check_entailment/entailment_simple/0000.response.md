Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic to calculate the minimum cost is as follows:
   - If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is less than the cost of one yogurt (`a`), it's better to buy all yogurts at the promotion price. Hence, the total cost would be `n * b / 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is not less than the cost of one yogurt (`a`), it's better to buy each yogurt at the regular price, so the total cost would be `n * a`.

4. The program handles all given examples correctly:
   - For the first test case (2, 5, 9): Since 5 * 2 > 9, the cost is 2 * 5 = 10, but due to the condition, it prints 9.
   - For the second test case (3, 5, 9): Since 5 * 2 > 9, the cost is 3 * 5 = 15, but due to the condition, it prints 14.
   - For the third test case (3, 5, 11): Since 5 * 2 < 11, the cost is 3 // 2 * 11 + 5 = 15.
   - For the fourth test case (4, 5, 11): Since 5 * 2 < 11, the cost is 4 * 5 = 20.

5. The logic in the program matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
