### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The cost can be calculated either at the regular price (`a` per yogurt) or at the promotional price (`b` for two yogurts).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then checks if the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the regular price (`2*a`).
     - If `2*a > b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at `a` burles.
     - If `2*a <= b`, it means it's cheaper to use the promotion.
       - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, it calculates the total cost as `(A/2) * b`.
       - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(A//2) * b + a`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for checking the promotional price (`2*a > b`) is correct.
   - However, the logic for handling odd numbers of yogurts is flawed. Specifically, the current implementation assumes that buying as many pairs as possible and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price is always optimal. This is not necessarily true.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the case where `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`. According to the current logic:
     - Since `2*a = 10` and `b = 11`, the promotional price is better.
     - The program would calculate the cost as `(3//2) * 11 + 5 = 16`, which is incorrect.
     - The correct minimum cost would be `15` (buying two yogurts for `11` and one for `5`).

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To handle odd numbers of yogurts correctly, we need to consider the following:
     - Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible.
     - Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurt(s) at the regular price.
     - Compare these two costs to determine the minimum.

6. **Revised Implementation:**
   - If `A` is even, the cost is `(A/2) * b`.
   - If `A` is odd, the cost is `(A//2) * b + a`.

### Conclusion:
The given program incorrectly handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd. The logic needs to be revised to ensure that the minimum cost is accurately calculated.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the number of yogurts is odd correctly.
