Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of input.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic within the function is designed to calculate the minimum cost based on the given conditions:
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the promotion price (`C`) is less than the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * B`), it means buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper. In this case, the program checks if `n` is even. If `n` is even, it calculates the total cost as `n * C / 2`. If `n` is odd, it buys `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price (`(n // 2) * C + B`).
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the promotion price is not cheaper than the cost of two yogurts at the regular price, the program simply calculates the total cost as `n * B`.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic implemented in the function correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
