### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The cost can be calculated either at the regular price (`a` per yogurt) or at the promotional price (`b` for two yogurts).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then checks if the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the regular price (`2*a`).
     - If `2*a > b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at `a` burles.
     - If `2*a <= b`, it means it's cheaper to use the promotion.
       - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, it calculates the total cost as `(A/2) * b`.
       - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(A//2) * b + a`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for checking the promotional price (`2*a > b`) is correct.
   - However, the logic for handling odd numbers of yogurts is flawed. Specifically, the program assumes that buying as many pairs as possible and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price is always the optimal strategy. This is not necessarily true.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3 5 11
     ```
   - According to the program, since `A` is odd, it will calculate the cost as `(A//2) * b + a = (3//2) * 11 + 5 = 1 * 11 + 5 = 16`.
   - However, the optimal solution would be to buy one pair of yogurts for `b` burles and one yogurt for `a` burles, resulting in a total cost of `11 + 5 = 16`. But this is the same as the program's output, so it might seem correct here.
   - Now consider another test case:
     ```
     1
     3 5 10
     ```
   - According to the program, since `2*a <= b`, it will calculate the cost as `(A/2) * b = (3/2) * 10 = 1 * 10 = 10`.
   - However, the optimal solution would be to buy one pair of yogurts for `b` burles and one yogurt for `a` burles, resulting in a total cost of `10 + 5 = 15`.
   - Therefore, the program's logic for odd numbers of yogurts is incorrect.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the edge case where the promotional price is exactly half the individual price (`2*a == b`). In such cases, the program will incorrectly assume that buying in pairs is always cheaper, which is not true.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions. The program fails to account for the optimal strategy when the number of yogurts is odd and the promotional price is exactly half the individual price.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
