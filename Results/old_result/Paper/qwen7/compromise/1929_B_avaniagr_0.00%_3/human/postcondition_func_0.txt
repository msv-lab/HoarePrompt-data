The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, if \( k < 4n - 3 \), it prints \((k // 2 + k \% 2)\). If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), it prints \(2n\). Additionally, if \( k = 4n - 2 \), it also prints \(2n\). The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the calculated values for each test case.
