Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 1
- `a` is a list containing the strings '010' and '110'
- `n` is 3
- `s` is the string '010'
- `x` is 0

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(s, sep='')
```

Here, `sep=''` means no separator between the printed items. Since `s` is the only item being printed, the `sep=''` parameter does not affect the output in this case.

Given that `s` is the string '010', the print statement will output this string directly.

Output: **010**
