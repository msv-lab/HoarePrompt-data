Output State: **The program returns a string that is the substring of 's' from the start up to the k-th character, repeated n times.**

This means that given the initial state where `t` is an integer between 1 and 676, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `s` is a string containing 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw', the program returns a new string. This new string is formed by taking the substring of `s` starting from the beginning up to the `k`-th character (exclusive) and repeating this substring `n` times.
