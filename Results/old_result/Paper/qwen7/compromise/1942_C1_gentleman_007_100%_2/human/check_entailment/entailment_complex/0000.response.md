Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**: The provided code includes a series of functions, but the primary logic for solving the problem is concentrated in the main block of code, which processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out.
2. **Problem Description**: The problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using a given set of vertices. The solution involves checking for consecutive vertices and handling edge cases where the polygon might wrap around.
3. **Main Block Analysis**:
   - **Input Reading**: The code correctly reads the number of sides `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the number of additional vertices `y` (which is always 0 in this version).
   - **Vertices Sorting and Processing**: The chosen vertices are sorted, and the code checks for consecutive vertices to maximize the number of triangles. This is done by iterating through the sorted list and counting consecutive vertices.
   - **Edge Cases Handling**: The code handles edge cases where the polygon wraps around (i.e., the first and last vertices are considered consecutive).
   - **Output**: The code correctly outputs the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all necessary cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
