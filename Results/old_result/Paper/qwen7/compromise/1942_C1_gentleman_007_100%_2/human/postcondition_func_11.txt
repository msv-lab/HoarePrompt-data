The function accepts two parameters: `num`, a positive integer, and `Prime_array`, a dictionary where keys are prime numbers and values are the corresponding prime factors of `num`. It returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of the original `num` and its value is the total count of that prime factor in the prime factorization of the original `num`. After executing, the function fully decomposes `num` into its prime factors and counts their occurrences, storing these in the returned dictionary `d`.
