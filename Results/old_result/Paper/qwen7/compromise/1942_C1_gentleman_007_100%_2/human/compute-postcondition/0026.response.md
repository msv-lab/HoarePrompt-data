Based on the initial state provided:

- `ver` is the first element in `q` that was removed using `popleft()`. This means `ver` is the node that was dequeued from the left end of the queue `q`.
- All nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) are marked as visited (`vis[node] == 1`). This indicates that these nodes have been processed and their status is set to visited.
- `q` contains at least one node excluding the one that was just removed. This means there are still nodes in the queue after removing `ver`.

The `print(ver, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `ver` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **ver (where ver is the node dequeued from the left end of the queue q)**
