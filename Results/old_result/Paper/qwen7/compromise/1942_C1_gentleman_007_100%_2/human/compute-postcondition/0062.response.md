Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1` for all nodes in the graph), and the queue `q` is empty.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, it means that every node reachable from the starting node `ver` has been visited. This is indicated by `vis[node] == 1` for all relevant nodes. Additionally, since all reachable nodes have been processed and added to the queue `q`, and then dequeued, the queue `q` is now empty.
