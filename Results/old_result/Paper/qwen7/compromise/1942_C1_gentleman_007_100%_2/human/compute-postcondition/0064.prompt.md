Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a deque containing `ver`, `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list or array of boolean values used to keep track of visited vertices, and `vis[ver]` is set to 1.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node (initial value of `ver`) are marked as visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and `q` contains all the nodes that were added during the iterations of the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and `q` is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1` for all nodes that were initially reachable), and the queue `q` is empty. The graph `graph[ver]` does not contain any unvisited nodes, meaning all connected nodes have been processed.

In this final state, the loop has iteratively marked all connected nodes as visited and added them to the queue until no more nodes could be reached from the starting node. As a result, the queue `q` is now empty, and the visitation status `vis[node]` is `1` for all nodes that were initially reachable from `ver`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
