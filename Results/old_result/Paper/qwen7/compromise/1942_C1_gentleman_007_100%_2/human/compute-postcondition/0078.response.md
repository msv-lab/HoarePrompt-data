To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `i != 0 and j != 0`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. **If `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`:**
   - In this case, `j` is decremented by 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be non-zero after decrementing.

2. **Otherwise (if `dp[i][j]` does not equal `dp[i][j - 1]`):**
   - `i` is decremented by 1.
   - `j` remains non-zero.

Given that `i` and `j` are non-zero integers at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that both `i` and `j` are non-zero for the loop to continue.

- Since `j` can be decremented, we need to ensure that `j` is still non-zero after decrementing.
- Since `i` can be decremented, we need to ensure that `i` is still non-zero after decrementing.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition that both `i` and `j` are non-zero.

State: **`i` and `j` are non-zero integers**
