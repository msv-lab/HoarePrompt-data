Output State: **`q` contains `node` and `ver`, `ver` is unchanged, `graph` is unchanged, `vis[ver]` is 1, `vis[node]` is 1, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the value of `node` to the list `q`. Since `q` initially contained `node` and `ver`, after appending `node`, `q` will now contain both `node` and `ver`. The values of `ver`, `graph`, `vis[ver]`, and `vis[node]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
