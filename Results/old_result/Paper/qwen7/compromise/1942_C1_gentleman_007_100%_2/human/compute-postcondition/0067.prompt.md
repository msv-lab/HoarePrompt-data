You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. The variable vis is a list or array of boolean values used to keep track of visited vertices, with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1` for all reachable nodes), and the queue `q` is empty. The graph `graph[ver]` does not contain any unvisited nodes, indicating that the entire connected component of the starting node has been fully processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a vertex `ver`, a graph represented as a dictionary, and a visitation status list `vis`. It returns `True` if the vertex `ver` has not been visited, marking it as visited in the `vis` list. Otherwise, it returns `False` if the vertex `ver` has already been visited.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
