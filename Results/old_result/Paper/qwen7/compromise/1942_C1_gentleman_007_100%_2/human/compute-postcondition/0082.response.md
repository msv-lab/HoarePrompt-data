Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `j` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1**

The value of `j` is decremented by 1, making it one less than its original value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only affects `j`. Both `i` and `j` are still non-zero integers, but `j` is now one less than its original value.
