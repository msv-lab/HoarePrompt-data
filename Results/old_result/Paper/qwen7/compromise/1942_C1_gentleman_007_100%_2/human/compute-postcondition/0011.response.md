Output State: **`q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after removing the first element, `ver` is the first element that was removed from the deque, `graph` is unchanged, `vis[ver]` is set to 1, `vis[node]` is set to 1, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, and `q` now contains the node `node`.**

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
