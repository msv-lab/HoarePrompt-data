Output State: **`graph[ver]' contains the node that was appended to the queue q`.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the queue `q`. The initial state of `graph[ver]` containing at least one node does not get directly affected by this operation. The only change is that the `node` is added to the queue `q`. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.
