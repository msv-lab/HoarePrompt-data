Output State: **`ver` retains its original value, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is equal to 0, `q` contains the node that was just appended, `vis[node]` is now equal to 1**.

This means that the value of `ver` remains unchanged, `graph[ver]` still contains at least one node where `vis[node]` was originally 0, `q` still contains the node that was just appended, and now the `vis[node]` for that specific node has been set to 1.
