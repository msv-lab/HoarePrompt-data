Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation either permutes rows or columns. The goal is to achieve the highest possible sum by strategically choosing permutations.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The code initializes a matrix `mat` with each element being a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\).
   - The sum `res` is calculated using the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for each row index \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - For each test case, the code prints the sum `res` and \(2n\) operations (one for each row and one for each column).
   - The operations are simply printing the row or column index followed by the permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\).

3. **Verification**:
   - **Sum Calculation**: The sum `res` is correctly calculated as per the given formula.
   - **Operations**: The operations printed are valid and follow the problem's constraints. Each row and column is permuted exactly once.
   - **Output Format**: The output format matches the required format, including the maximum sum and the number of operations.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where \(n = 1\) correctly by setting the single element to 1.
   - For larger \(n\), the solution ensures that each row and column is permuted, which is sufficient to achieve the maximum possible sum as per the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
