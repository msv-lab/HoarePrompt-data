Output State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`total`, `t`, `i`, and `mat`) remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is determined by the user's input, which must be an integer within the specified range.
