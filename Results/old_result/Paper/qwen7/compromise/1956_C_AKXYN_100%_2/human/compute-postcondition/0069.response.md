Output State: **The loop will execute for each test case defined by `t`. For each test case, `n` will be processed according to the given conditions. After all iterations, `res` will be the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` across all test cases. The value of `total` will be the cumulative sum of all `res` values from each test case. The variable `t` will remain within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). The matrix `mat` will be printed as specified, but its final state will not affect the output value of `res`. The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 10 for the last observed state, and it can vary for different test cases.**

This output state describes the final values and conditions after the loop has executed for all iterations, focusing on the key variables `res` and `t`, and noting the constraints on `n`.
