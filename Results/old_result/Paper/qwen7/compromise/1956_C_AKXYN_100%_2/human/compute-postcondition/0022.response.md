Output State: **`res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is equal to 0.**

### Explanation:
Given the loop structure and the pattern observed, the loop continues to add the value \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) to `res` until `i` reaches 0. Since the loop starts with `i` equal to `n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, once `i` becomes 0, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, and the final value of `res` remains 140, as no further additions are made to `res` when `i` is 0. The conditions for `t`, `n`, and the initial value of `i` are as described above.
