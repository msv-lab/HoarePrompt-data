Based on the initial state and the calculations provided:

- `res` is explicitly given as 360.
- `n` is determined to be 4 because the problem states that after 3 iterations, `i` is 4, and the value of `res` is 108, which matches the pattern for `n = 4`.
- The expression `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which shifts the bits of `n` one position to the left, effectively multiplying `n` by 2. For `n = 4`, `n << 1` results in `4 * 2 = 8`.

Therefore, the `print(res, n << 1)` statement will print the value of `res` followed by the result of `n << 1`.

Output: **360, 8**
