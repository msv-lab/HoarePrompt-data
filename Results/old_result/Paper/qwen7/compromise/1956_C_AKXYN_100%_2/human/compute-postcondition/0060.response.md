Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 360 (though this is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) (also not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 10.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n` (the value of `n` is not explicitly given but it is stated that `n` must be greater than or equal to 10).
- `res` is 81 (though this is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'1 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i` after the number 1. Since `i` is 10, this part will be `'1 10'`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object into arguments for the print function. This will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given that `n` must be at least 10, the range will include at least the numbers from 1 to 10. However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only say that the range will go up to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... n** (where the sequence continues up to `n` if `n` is greater than 10).
