Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head consists of the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is already given as 1.
   - `n` is not explicitly given, but it determines the number of iterations in the loop.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the loop will execute if `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 so that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
