Output State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` is an input integer, and `mat` is initialized as a square matrix of size `n` x `n` filled with integers from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `mat` as a list of lists (a matrix) where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, and this initialization is done for `n` times, making `mat` a square matrix of size `n` x `n`. The values of `total`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
