Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is explicitly given as 140.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). However, the value of `t` does not affect the output of the given print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 2. Let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 3 (since it must be greater than 2).
- `i` is equal to `n - 2`, so if `n` is 3, then `i` is \(3 - 2 = 1\).

Now, let's break down the print statement:

```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

- `'2 %d' % i` will substitute `i` with its value, which is 1. So, this part becomes `'2 1'`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` will unpack the range object from 1 to `n + 1`. If `n` is 3, then `range(1, 3 + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output:

Output: **2 1 1 2 3**
