Given the initial state:
- `res` is 140.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is equal to `n-2`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `n - 2`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 2, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 3 (the smallest integer greater than 2).
   - Therefore, if `n = 3`, then `i = 3 - 2 = 1`.

2. **Value of `range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - If `n = 3`, then `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence from 1 to 3.
   - So, `range(1, 4)` will produce the values `[1, 2, 3]`.

3. **String formatting:**
   - The string `'1 %d' % i` will be formatted with the value of `i`.
   - Given `i = 1`, the string becomes `'1 1'`.

4. **Combining the parts:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range values into separate arguments.
   - Therefore, `print('1 1', *range(1, 4))` will print the string `'1 1'` followed by the values `1, 2, 3`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
Output: **1 1 1 2 3**
