Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value, which is converted to an integer and used as the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 1, and `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` being greater than 4.
   - The loop will execute based on the input value, which is an integer read from the user.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, the input value itself needs to be adjusted for the next iteration. Let's denote this input value as `k`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be a valid integer (i.e., \(1 \leq k \leq 500\)).

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are:

- `total` remains 360.
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `i` remains 1.
- `mat` remains a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` being greater than 4.
- The input value `k` for the next iteration must be a valid integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4, and the input value for the next iteration must be a valid integer within the specified range.**
