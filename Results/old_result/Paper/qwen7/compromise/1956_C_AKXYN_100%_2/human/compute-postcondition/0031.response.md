Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 24
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `i` is 3
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 1

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute again**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - Since `i` is now 4, `n` must still be greater than 4 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `res` remains 24
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `i` is now 4
- `n` must be greater than 4

State: **`res` is 24, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
