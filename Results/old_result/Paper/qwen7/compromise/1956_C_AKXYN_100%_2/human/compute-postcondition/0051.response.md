Output State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 2, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 9, `n` must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` becomes 2. The calculation for `res` is as follows: 
- Initially, `i` is 1, so `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` equals `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`.
- After the addition, `res` becomes `0 + 6 = 6`.

However, since `i` is now 2, the next time this line of code is executed, `i` would be 3, and the process would continue. But based on the given information and the single execution of the provided line of code, the updated state is as described.
