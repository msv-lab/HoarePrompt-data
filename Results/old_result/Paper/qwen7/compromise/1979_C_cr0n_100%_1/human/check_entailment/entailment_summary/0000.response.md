Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means we need to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\) such that:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i
   \]
   Simplifying, this becomes:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i
   \]

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` returns \( \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \).
   - This function simplifies the product of two numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is useful for finding a common denominator when dealing with fractions.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` takes an integer \(N\) and a list of integers \(k_1, k_2, ..., k_N\).
   - It calculates a common denominator `den` by applying `func_1` successively to the elements of the list.
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in the original list, truncated to an integer.
   - Finally, it checks if the remaining value `den` minus the sum of `vprod` is non-negative. If it is, it prints the elements of `vprod`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Checking the Solution**:
   - The approach in `func_2` is to find a common denominator that can be used to distribute the bets such that the condition is satisfied.
   - By calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using `func_1`, the code ensures that the bets can be scaled appropriately.
   - The check at the end (`den - sum(vprod) > 0`) ensures that the total bet is indeed less than the winnings for any outcome.

Given the logic and the steps taken in `func_2`, it correctly implements the required functionality to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
