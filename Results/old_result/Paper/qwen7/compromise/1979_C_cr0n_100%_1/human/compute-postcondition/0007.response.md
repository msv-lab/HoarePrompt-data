Output State: **`den` is the result of `den - sum(vprod)`. `vprod` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The initial state defines that `den` is the result of successively applying `func_1` to the initial value `den` and each element in the list `vals`, and `vprod` is a list of values obtained by dividing `den` by each element in `vals` using integer division. The code snippet `den = den - sum(vprod)` updates the value of `den` by subtracting the sum of all elements in `vprod` from `den`. The list `vprod` itself does not change during this operation.
