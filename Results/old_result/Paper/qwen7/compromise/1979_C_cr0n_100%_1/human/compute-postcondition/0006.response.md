Output State: **`den` is the result of successively applying `func_1` to the initial value `den` and each element in the list `vals`; `vprod` is a list of values obtained by dividing `den` by each element in `vals` using integer division.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `vprod` where each element is the result of integer division of `den` by each corresponding element in the list `vals`. The value of `den` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the result of successively applying `func_1` to the initial value `den` and each element in the list `vals`.
