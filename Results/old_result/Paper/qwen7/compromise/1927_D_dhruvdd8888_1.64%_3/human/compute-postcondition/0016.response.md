Output State: **The output state depends on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop. For each query (l, r), the output could be one of the following: (-1, -1), (s, e+1) where s and e are determined based on the binary search result. Since the exact inputs are not given, the output cannot be precisely calculated. However, it will consist of multiple lines, each containing either two numbers or two -1s, corresponding to the results of each query.**

This output state describes the possible outcomes for each query processed within the loop, but without specific input data, the exact results cannot be determined.
