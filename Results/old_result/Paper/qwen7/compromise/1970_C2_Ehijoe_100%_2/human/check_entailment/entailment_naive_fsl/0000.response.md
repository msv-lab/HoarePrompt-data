Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to determine the winner of the game. Instead, it appears to be checking if a node has any inactive neighbors, which is not relevant to determining the winner.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game for each starting node and determine the winner based on optimal play. The current implementation does not simulate the game moves or check who can make the last valid move. Therefore, it cannot correctly determine the winner for each round.

For example, consider a simple tree with 3 nodes (1-2-3) and the stone starting at node 1. According to the problem description, Ron would win because he can always force Hermione into a losing position if both play optimally. However, the current program does not simulate this scenario and would not correctly determine the winner.
