Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers from 0 to n-1, and each key points to a list containing its adjacent nodes based on user input, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys (nodes) that have exactly one adjacent node, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of func_1(nodes, start)**.

Explanation: The line `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` calls the function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. The function `func_1` returns a value which is assigned to the variable `moves`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `moves` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is known that `func_1` takes `nodes` and `start` as inputs and returns a value.
