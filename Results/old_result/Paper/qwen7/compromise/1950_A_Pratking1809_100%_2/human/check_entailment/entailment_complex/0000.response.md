Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case, reading three digits (`a`, `b`, `c`) for each case.
2. **Condition Checking**: For each set of three digits, the program checks the conditions for a stair and a peak:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NONE'.
3. **Output Consistency**: The output matches the expected format as specified in the problem description. Each test case results in one of the three possible outputs ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE').

Given the provided example and the logical structure of the program, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
