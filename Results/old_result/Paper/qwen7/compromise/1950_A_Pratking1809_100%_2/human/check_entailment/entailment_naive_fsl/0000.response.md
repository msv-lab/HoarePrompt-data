Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal (i.e., `a == b == c`). According to the problem description, such a case should result in "NONE", but the current implementation will incorrectly identify it as either "STAIR" or "PEAK" depending on the order of comparison. For example, if `a = b = c = 5`, the program will output "PEAK" because it checks `a < b > c` first, which is true. This violates the requirement that such cases should output "NONE".

To fix this, the program should explicitly check for the case where all three digits are equal and handle it separately:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this modification, the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
