### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between any two cities on a number line, where the cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of moving to any other city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the distance to the closest city for each city in the list, except for the first and last cities which are set to 0 since they don't have a previous or next city, respectively.
   - This is done by comparing the current city's coordinate with the coordinates of its neighbors and selecting the smaller distance.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions using the results from `func_1`.
   - For each query, it uses these prefix sums to find the minimum cost to travel between the two given cities.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the starting city index (`a`) is less than the ending city index (`b`). If `a` is greater than `b`, it reverses the logic to use the backward prefix sums.
   - This ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly regardless of the direction of travel.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the closest city distances in `func_1` is correct.
   - The main program correctly uses the prefix sums to compute the minimum cost for each query.
   - The handling of different query directions is also correct.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
