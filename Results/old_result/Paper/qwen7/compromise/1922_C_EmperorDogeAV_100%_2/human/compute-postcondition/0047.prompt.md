Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999999999999999
    forward = 999999999999999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `back` is the value of `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. Otherwise, `back` remains unchanged. After executing the if-else block, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `back` is updated to `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`) or remains `999999999999999999` (if `i >= n - 1`). Additionally, `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`; otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1` or remains `999999999999999999` if `i` is not less than `n - 1`. Additionally, if `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`; otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
