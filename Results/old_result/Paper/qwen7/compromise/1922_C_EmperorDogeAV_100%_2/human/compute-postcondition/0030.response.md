Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `back` is updated to `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`) or remains `999999999999999999` (if `i >= n - 1`), and `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.**

This means that the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been set to `1`, while the values of `i`, `back`, and `forward` remain as per their previous conditions.
