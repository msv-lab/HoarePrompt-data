Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `forward` to `cities[i + 1]`. Since `i` is already `i + 1` from the initial state, the value of `i + 1` is used directly. The values of `back` and the condition for updating `back` remain unchanged because no operation directly modifies them. Therefore, `back` remains as `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is now set to `cities[i + 1]`.
