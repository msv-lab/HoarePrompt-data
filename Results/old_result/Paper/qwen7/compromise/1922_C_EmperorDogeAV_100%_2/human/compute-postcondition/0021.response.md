Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`).

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer, `back` is the value of `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. Otherwise, `back` remains unchanged.
   - After executing the if-else block, `prog_cities[i]` is updated based on the conditions given.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `back` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration unless `i` becomes 0, in which case `back` would be the value of `cities[-1]` (which is out of bounds but doesn't affect the logic here).
   - `forward` will be the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`.

Given these points, let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `back` will remain the same.
- `forward` will be the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `back` is the value of `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can express the state in a general form:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `back` is the value of `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`**.

This ensures that the loop can continue executing with the correct values for `i`, `back`, and `forward` at the start of each iteration.
