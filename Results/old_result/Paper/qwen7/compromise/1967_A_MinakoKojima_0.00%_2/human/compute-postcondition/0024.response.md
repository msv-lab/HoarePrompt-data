Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
   - This means `i` was one less than its current value.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`, so `i` will become `n`.

5. **Update the necessary states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `i` is `n`**.
