Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0] * (a[3] - a[2])`
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration because the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `n`, and `n` does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0] * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1**
