Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the input, which means the loop will run for a number of times specified by the user. The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any state that needs adjustment.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer input provided by the user. There are no specific variables inside the loop that get modified within the loop itself (other than the loop counter `_`, which is not relevant here).

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: Since the loop is controlled by the user input and there are no internal modifications to the variables `ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `m` within the loop, the state remains unchanged from one iteration to the next.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by the difference between each consecutive element in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
