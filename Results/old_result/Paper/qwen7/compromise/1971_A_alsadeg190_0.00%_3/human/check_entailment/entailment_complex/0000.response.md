Reasoning:

1. The problem requires reading multiple pairs of integers and printing the minimum and maximum of each pair.
2. The annotated program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `x` and `y`.
3. Inside the loop, the program checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
4. This logic correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers and prints them in the required format.
5. The provided example input and output match the behavior of the annotated program.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
