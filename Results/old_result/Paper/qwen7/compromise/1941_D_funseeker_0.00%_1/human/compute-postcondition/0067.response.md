Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for q in ans:`. The only variable here is `q`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `q`**: For the loop to execute, `q` must be an element of `ans`. Since `q` is not initialized before the loop, we need to ensure that `ans` is not empty.

3. **Check the current state**: The state before the loop starts is given as:
   - `ans` is equal to `temp`, and `temp` is an empty set.
   - `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `temp` is an empty set.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `ans` is equal to `temp` and `temp` is an empty set, `ans` is also an empty set. Therefore, `ans` cannot contain any elements, and the loop will not execute because there are no elements to iterate over.

5. **Conclusion**: To ensure the loop can execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. This means `temp` (and consequently `ans`) should be modified to contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is an empty set, `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**
