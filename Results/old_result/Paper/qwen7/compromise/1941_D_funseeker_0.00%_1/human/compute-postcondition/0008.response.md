Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` contains an element which is `(q + r) % n`, `c` is either '0' or '?'**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the set `temp`. The element added is the result of `(q + r) % n`. The initial state of `ans` being a list with at least one element and `c` being either '0' or '?' remains unchanged.
