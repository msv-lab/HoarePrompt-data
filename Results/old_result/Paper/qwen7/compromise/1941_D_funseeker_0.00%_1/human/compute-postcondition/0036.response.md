Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `q` which iterates over the collection `ans`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ans`**: From the given information, `ans` is equal to `temp`. Since `temp` is an empty set, `ans` is also an empty set initially.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop `for q in ans:` to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. Since `ans` is currently an empty set, the loop cannot execute as written.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `ans` is no longer an empty set.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `ans` contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is an empty set, `r` is the integer value converted from the original string `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the string `func_1().split()[1]`, `temp` is an empty set, `m` is `m - 1`**
