Output State: **`c` is a character; if `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` contains an additional element `(q - r) % n`; `temp` now contains the element `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `(q - r) % n` to the list `temp`. The condition for adding an element to `temp` (`c` being '0' or '?') remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element added to `temp` and retains the original condition for `temp`.
