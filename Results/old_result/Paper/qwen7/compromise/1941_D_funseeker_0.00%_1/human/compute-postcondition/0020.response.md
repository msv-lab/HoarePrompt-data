Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the next element from `ans`, `temp` contains an element equal to `(q - r) % n`, and `temp` stays unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'.**

Explanation: The code adds an element to `temp`, which is `(q - r) % n`. This means that `temp` now contains an element equal to `(q - r) % n`. The values of `ans` and `q` remain unchanged, and `temp` stays unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'.
