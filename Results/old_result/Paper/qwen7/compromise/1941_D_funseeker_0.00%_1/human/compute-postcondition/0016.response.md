Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for q in ans:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is:
   - `ans` must contain at least one element.
   - If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains an element which is `(q - r) % n`.
   - There is no change in `ans` if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since `q` is iterating over `ans`, the value of `q` will change with each iteration, but `ans` itself does not change based on the loop condition.
   - The value of `q` will be taken from `ans` during each iteration, but the contents of `ans` remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop does not modify `ans`.
   - `q` will take the next element from `ans` during the next iteration.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `q`, which will take the next element from `ans`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the next element from `ans`, and `temp` is unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'**.
