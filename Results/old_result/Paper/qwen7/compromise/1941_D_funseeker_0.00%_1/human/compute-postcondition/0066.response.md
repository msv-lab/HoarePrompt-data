Output State: **`ans` is equal to `temp`, `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The line `temp = set()` creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `temp`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `r`, or `c`. Therefore, the values of `ans` and `temp` remain the same as they were initially, and `r` and `c` retain their original values as well.
