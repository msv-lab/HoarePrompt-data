Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000); `m` is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000); `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 <= x <= n); `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is now equal to `temp`, `r` remains as the integer value converted from the original string `r`, `c` remains as the string `c`, and `temp` is a set containing elements that are either `(q - r) % n` or `(q + r) % n` based on the conditions specified in the loop body.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is equal to `temp`, which contains all unique elements added during each iteration based on the conditions specified by the value of `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is a set containing six unique elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and the original elements from before the if-else block, where `q` is the last element processed in `ans`, `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?'; `temp` is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
