Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the element `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.add(n)` adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Since `ans` was initially empty (or more specifically, it only contains the element `n` after this operation), the set now contains only one element, which is `n`. All other variables remain in their initial state, but since no other variables are mentioned or changed, we focus on updating `ans`.
