Output State: **`ans` is equal to `temp`, `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**.

Explanation: The code splits the output of `func_1()` into two parts, assigning the first part to `r` and the second part to `c`. The values of `ans` and `temp` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `m` must still be greater than 0 as per the initial condition.
