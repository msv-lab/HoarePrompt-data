### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are correctly defined to read input from standard input. `func_1` reads a line, `func_2` converts it to an integer, and `func_3` splits and converts a line into a list of integers. `func_4` uses these functions to process the input for each test case.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - The function correctly initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` based on the direction of the throw. This part of the logic is correct as it handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws appropriately using modulo arithmetic.
   - The special case where the player index might wrap around to 0 is handled correctly by adding `n` to 0 and discarding 0 before adding `n`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for updating the set `ans` is sound. It correctly accounts for both possible directions of the throw.
   - The adjustment for wrapping around to the last player when the index reaches 0 is correctly implemented.
   - The final output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the direction is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both possible directions.
   - The program correctly handles the special case where the player index might wrap around to 0.

5. **Performance**:
   - The use of sets ensures that the final set `ans` contains only unique elements, which is efficient for the given constraints.
   - The overall complexity of the program is linear with respect to the number of throws, making it efficient.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after the specified number of throws, considering both known and unknown directions.

### Final:
**True**
