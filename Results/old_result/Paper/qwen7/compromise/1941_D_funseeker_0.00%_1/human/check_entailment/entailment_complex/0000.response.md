Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a line of input from the standard input and returns it stripped of any trailing whitespace. It is used to read the input for each test case.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function returns the number of test cases by calling `func_1()`. It correctly initializes the process for handling multiple test cases.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function returns a list of integers by splitting a string returned by `func_1()` and converting each element to an integer. However, based on the problem description, it should actually return a list of tuples (distance, direction) for each throw. This function is currently misaligned with the expected input format.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function processes the input for each test case. It correctly handles the logic for calculating the possible positions of the ball after each throw. The function iterates through the list of throws, updating the set of possible positions based on the direction of each throw. It also handles the special case where a throw might be either clockwise or counterclockwise (indicated by `?`). Finally, it ensures that the set of possible positions is adjusted correctly and prints the results.

Given the above analysis, the main issue lies with Function 3 (`func_3`). The function is supposed to return a list of tuples containing the distance and direction of each throw, but instead, it returns a list of integers. This discrepancy means that the input for Function 4 is not correctly formatted, leading to potential errors in the calculations.

However, since the problem statement and the provided solution logic in Function 4 seem to handle the correct input format (as inferred from the problem description), we can assume that Function 3 should be corrected to return the appropriate data structure.

Given the current implementation details and assuming that Function 3 is fixed to return the correct data structure, the overall logic of the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **False**

To make the program fully correct, Function 3 needs to be updated to return a list of tuples (distance, direction) instead of a list of integers.
