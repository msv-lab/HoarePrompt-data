The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates either \( a \times n \) or \( b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2 \), depending on whether \( n \) is greater than 1. It then prints the minimum of these two values. If \( n = 1 \), it simply prints \( a \). After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
