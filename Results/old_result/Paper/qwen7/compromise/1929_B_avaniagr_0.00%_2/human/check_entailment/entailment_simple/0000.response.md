Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the formula used in the program accurately calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored based on the given constraints.

Let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input from standard input and splits it into `n` and `k`.
2. **Formula Explanation**:
   - The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2)` is used when `k < 4 * n - 3`. This formula essentially calculates the ceiling value of `k / 2`, which is the minimum number of cells needed to ensure at least `k` diagonals are covered when `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`.
   - The expression `2 * n` is used when `k >= 4 * n - 3`. This ensures that all diagonals are covered since `4 * n - 2` is the maximum number of diagonals, and having `2 * n` cells guarantees coverage.
   - The additional condition `(k == 4 * n - 2)` is redundant because it falls under the `2 * n` case already.

Given the problem statement and the examples provided, the formula seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of cells required to cover at least `k` diagonals. The formula accounts for the different scenarios where `k` is less than, equal to, or greater than `4 * n - 3`.

Therefore, the program logic matches the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
