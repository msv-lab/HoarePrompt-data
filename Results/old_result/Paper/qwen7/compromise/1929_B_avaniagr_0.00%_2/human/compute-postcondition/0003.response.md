Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function returns a value based on the conditions involving n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, with specific constraints on their values. It then processes these values according to certain conditions and returns a result based on those conditions.
