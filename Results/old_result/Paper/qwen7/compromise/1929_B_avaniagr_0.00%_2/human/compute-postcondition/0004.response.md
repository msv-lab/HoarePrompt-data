Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). It calculates and prints an integer value for each test case based on the following rules: if \( k < 4n - 3 \), it prints \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \); if \( k \geq 4n - 3 \) and \( k \neq 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \); if \( k = 4n - 2 \), it also prints \( 2n \). The function reads these values from standard input and outputs them one by one.**
