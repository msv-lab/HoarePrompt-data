Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed for each test case. For each test case, if \( k < 4n - 3 \), the output is \((k // 2 + k \% 2)\). If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the output is \(2n\). If \( k = 4n - 2 \), the output is also \(2n\).

This means the output will be a sequence of numbers based on the conditions provided for each pair of \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
