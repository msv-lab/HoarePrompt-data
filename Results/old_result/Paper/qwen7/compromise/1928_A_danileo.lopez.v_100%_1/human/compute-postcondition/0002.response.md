Output State: The output consists of 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration. For each iteration, if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, and the divided halves do not match the other number, 'Yes' is printed; otherwise, 'No' is printed. If neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is even, 'No' is printed. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' depends on the input values provided during each iteration.
