Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 1, `ans` is either 4 or 3 (depending on the initial value), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 2` and must be greater than 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 2.**
