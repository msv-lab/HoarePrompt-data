Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is set to 3, `r` is set to `n - 1`, and `ans` is set to 3 if `a[r]` equals 0. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.
