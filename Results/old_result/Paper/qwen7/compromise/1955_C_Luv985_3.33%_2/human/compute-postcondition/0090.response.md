Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`; `n` is an integer from the input; `k` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `r`.
