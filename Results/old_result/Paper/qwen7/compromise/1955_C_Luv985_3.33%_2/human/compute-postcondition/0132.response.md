Postcondition: `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is 1. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is set to 1. There is no change in `l`, `r`, `mi`, or `t` since they are not modified within the if block, and there is no else part to consider.
