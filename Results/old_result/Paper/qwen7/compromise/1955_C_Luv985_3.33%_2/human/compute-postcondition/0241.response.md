Output State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 0, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is the number of operations performed plus `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` in the last operation, `t` is 0.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding 1 to its current value if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
