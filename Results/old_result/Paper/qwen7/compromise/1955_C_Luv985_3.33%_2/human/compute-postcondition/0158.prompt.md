Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`; `n` is an integer from the input; `k` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is either `k - 2 * mi` or greater than `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list, `l` is 1 or 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is not reduced by `2 * mi`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, and `ans` is `ans + 1` if `a[r]` equals 0, or `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `l` is either 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, and `ans` is 2 if `a[r]` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1, and `t` is `k % 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
