Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while T:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `T` is non-zero.

2. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `T`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: Since the loop continues as long as `T` is non-zero, for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than 0. Given that `T` was set to `T - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `T` must be 1 or more for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `T`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
