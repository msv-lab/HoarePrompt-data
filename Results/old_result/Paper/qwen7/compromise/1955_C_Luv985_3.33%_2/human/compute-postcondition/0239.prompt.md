Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers converted from the original strings, `k` is an integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` in the last operation, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is not reduced by `2 * mi`.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is set to 2, and if the current value of `a[r]` is 0, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is set to 3, `r` is set to `n - 1`, and `ans` is set to 3 if `a[r]` equals 0. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 1, `ans` is either 4 or 3 (depending on the initial value), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 2` and must be greater than 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
