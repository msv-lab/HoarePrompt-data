Output State: **`a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 1, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`**.

This means that `k` has been decreased by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[n-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
