Output State: **`l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`r`, `k`, `mi`, `a[0]`, `a[r]`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
