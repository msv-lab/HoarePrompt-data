Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`; `n` is an integer from the input; `k` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The variables `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
