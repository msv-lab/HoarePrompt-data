Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`; `n` is an integer from the input; `k` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string in the list `a` to an integer using the `map` function and `lambda` expression. Since `a` was originally a list of strings, after executing this line, `a` will now be a list of integers. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
