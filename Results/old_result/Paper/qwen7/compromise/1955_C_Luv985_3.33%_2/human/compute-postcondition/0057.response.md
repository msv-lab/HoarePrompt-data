Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute one more time.

The loop condition is:
```python
while l < r and k > 0:
```

From the provided information, we know the following states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `k` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda
- `l` is 3
- `r` is `n - 2`
- `ans` is 3
- `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`
- `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`
- `a[2]` is decreased by `mi`
- `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`
- `mi` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[n - 3]`
- If `a[r]` equals 0, then `ans` is set to 4. Otherwise, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` is reduced by either `2 * mi` or `0`, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 3, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[n - 3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to check the loop condition `l < r and k > 0`.

1. **Condition `l < r`:**
   - `l` is currently 3.
   - `r` is `n - 2`.
   - For `l < r` to be true, `n - 2` must be greater than 3, which means `n` must be greater than 5.

2. **Condition `k > 0`:**
   - `k` is reduced by `2 * mi` and must be greater than 0.
   - Since `k` was reduced by `2 * mi` in the previous iteration, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi` to still be greater than 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the values of `n` and `k` such that both conditions are satisfied.

State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` must be greater than 5, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`**
