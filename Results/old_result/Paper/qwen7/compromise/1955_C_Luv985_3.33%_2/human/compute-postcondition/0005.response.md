Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is a string from input**

Explanation: The code `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` into an integer. The value of `T` remains `T - 1` as it was not affected by the code. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. Therefore, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is now an integer from input, and `k` is a string from input.
