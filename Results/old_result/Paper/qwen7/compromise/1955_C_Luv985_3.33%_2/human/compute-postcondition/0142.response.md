Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 1. After executing this line, `ans` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
