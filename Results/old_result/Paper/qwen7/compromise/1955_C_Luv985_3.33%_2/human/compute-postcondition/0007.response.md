Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` takes a single input string from the user and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged as well. The input string is split and stored in the list `a`.
