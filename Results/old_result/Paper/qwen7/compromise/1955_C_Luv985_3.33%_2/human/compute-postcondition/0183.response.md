Output State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, the current value of `a[l]` is 0, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
