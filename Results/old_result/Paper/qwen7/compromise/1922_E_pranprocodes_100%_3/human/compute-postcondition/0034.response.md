Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999997, `ans` is a list containing -99999998, `x` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is an even number that has been halved and is now a positive integer greater than 1. After executing `x -= 1`, `x` is decreased by 1, making it a positive integer greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
