Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is an even number that has been halved and is now a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing [99999999]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` (which is 99999999) to the list `ans`. The value of `ans` changes from either [-99999999] or [-100000000] to [99999999] because appending 99999999 to the list replaces the previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
