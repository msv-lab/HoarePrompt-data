Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1; `t` is an input integer increased by 2; `ans` is a list containing the function `max`**.

The code appends the `max` function to the list `ans`. Since no other variables are affected, the initial states of `x` and `t` remain unchanged. The `ans` list now contains the `max` function.
