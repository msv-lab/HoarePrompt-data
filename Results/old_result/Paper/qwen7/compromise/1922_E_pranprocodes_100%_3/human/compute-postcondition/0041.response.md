Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.
- `x` is now 1.
- `max` is 99999998.
- `min` is -99999998.
- `ans` is a list containing alternating values starting from `max` (99999998) and decreasing by 1 each time until `min` (-99999998), and `ans` has been reversed.

To determine the value of `t`, we need to consider how many iterations it takes to reduce `x` from its initial value to 1. However, the initial value of `x` is not provided directly in the initial state. Since the only information given about `t` is that it is the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, and no specific value for `x` is mentioned, we cannot determine the exact number of iterations without additional context.

Given this, the value of `t` remains unknown based solely on the provided information.

Output: **t (where t is the number of iterations required to reduce x to 1, but the exact value is unknown)**
