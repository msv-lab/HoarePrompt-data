Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing [99999999], `x` is halved.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is halved using integer division (`//`), which means `x` is divided by 2 and the result is an integer. Since `x` was originally an even number that had been halved and is now a positive integer greater than 1, the new value of `x` is half of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
