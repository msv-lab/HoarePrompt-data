Output State: `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing alternating values starting from 99999999 (decreasing by 1 each iteration) and -99999998 (increasing by 1 each iteration).

Explanation: The loop continues to run until `x` becomes 1. During each iteration, if `x` is even, `max` decreases by 1 and `x` is halved. If `x` is odd, `min` increases by 1 and `x` is decremented by 1. The variable `t` keeps track of the number of iterations. Once `x` reaches 1, the loop terminates. The list `ans` will contain a sequence of numbers starting from `max` (or `min` when `x` is odd) and alternating between decreasing `max` and increasing `min` until `x` becomes 1.
