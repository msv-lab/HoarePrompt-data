Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is different from 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`**

Explanation: The variable `x` is decremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was (but not equal to 1) to a new value that is now different from 0. The other variables (`t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
