Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` initializes an empty list for the variable `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `t`, `max`, `min`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
