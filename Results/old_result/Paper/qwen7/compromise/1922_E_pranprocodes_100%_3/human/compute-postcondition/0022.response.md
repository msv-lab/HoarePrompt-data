Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is different from 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -99999999**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `min` is -99999999, so the list `ans` now contains -99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
