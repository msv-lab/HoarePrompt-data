Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1 following the given rules, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting from `max` and reversed, `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations (`i + t`).**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `min` from its initial value of 1 to -100000000. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x`, `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` retain their respective initial conditions except for `min`, which now has a new value.
