Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 0; `t` is an input integer increased by 2; `ans` is a list containing the function `min`; `min` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was initially an input integer not equal to 1, after decrementing by 1, `x` is now an input integer not equal to 0. The value of `t`, `ans`, and `min` remain unchanged.
