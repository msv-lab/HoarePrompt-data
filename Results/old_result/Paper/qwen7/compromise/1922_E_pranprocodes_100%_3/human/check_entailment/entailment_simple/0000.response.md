Reasoning:
1. The goal is to find an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
2. The provided solution attempts to construct such an array by using a specific pattern based on the binary representation of `X`.
3. The algorithm works as follows:
   - It initializes `max` and `min` to large positive and negative values, respectively.
   - It iterates while `x` is not 1.
   - If `x` is even, it appends `max` to the answer list, decrements `max`, and divides `x` by 2.
   - If `x` is odd, it appends `min` to the answer list, increments `min`, and decrements `x` by 1.
   - This process continues until `x` becomes 1.
   - The list `ans` is then reversed before printing.
4. The key insight is that the number of increasing subsequences in the constructed array is related to the binary representation of `X`. Specifically, the number of increasing subsequences is the product of the lengths of the segments in the binary representation of `X`.

Given this reasoning, the provided code correctly implements the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for the given constraints.
