Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the removal of elements to break the beauty condition of the array. Instead, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number, which does not directly translate to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4
5
1 2 1 2 1
1
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
-1
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
-1
3
```

For the third test case `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program calculates the minimum segment length as 3 but does not correctly determine that removing 3 elements (the two `5` and one of the `3`s) is the solution. The program fails to consider the optimal strategy of breaking the beauty condition by removing the necessary elements.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
