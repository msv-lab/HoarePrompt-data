Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the given code does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Length of Segments**: The current implementation tries to find the minimum length of segments where elements are the same but doesn't consider the possibility of removing these segments to break the beauty condition.

2. **Misinterpretation of "Beautiful" Array**: A beautiful array can be broken by removing elements in such a way that no two adjacent elements (with one element in between) are equal. The current approach does not account for this properly.

3. **Incorrect Output for Certain Cases**: For example, in the second test case, the expected output is `1` (remove one element), but the current code might not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical by the given operation and then calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break this sequence.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest segment of consecutive identical elements
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == ar[i-1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        # If the entire array is identical, it cannot be broken
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The minimum number of removals needed is the length of the longest segment minus one
            print(max_length - 1)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It iterates through the array to find the longest segment of consecutive identical elements.
2. If the entire array is identical, it outputs `-1` because it cannot be broken.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break the longest segment by subtracting one from its length.
