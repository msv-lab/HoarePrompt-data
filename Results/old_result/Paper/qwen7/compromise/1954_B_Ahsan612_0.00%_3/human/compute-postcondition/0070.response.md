Output State: **`i` is 6, `same` is 1, `minn` is `min(6, 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `minn` is assigned the minimum value between `minn` and `same`. Initially, `same` is 1. Since the value of `minn` is not specified in the initial state, it is assumed to be greater than or equal to 1 (otherwise, `same` would already be assigned to `minn`). After executing the line `minn = min(minn, same)`, `minn` will be updated to the minimum value between its original value and 1. Given that `same` is 1, `minn` will be updated to 1 if `minn` was initially greater than 1, or remain unchanged if `minn` was 1 or less. Therefore, `minn` is now `min(6, 1)`, which is 1.
