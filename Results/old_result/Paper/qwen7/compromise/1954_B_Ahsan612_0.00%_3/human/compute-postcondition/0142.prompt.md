You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the array is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `minn` will hold the minimum value of the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar` across all test cases. If no such minimum is found (i.e., all sequences are of length 1), `minn` will be -1. `same` will be 1 for the last iteration, `num` will be the last element of `ar` for the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`, and `t` will be the total number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) and returns whether the array `a` is beautiful.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
