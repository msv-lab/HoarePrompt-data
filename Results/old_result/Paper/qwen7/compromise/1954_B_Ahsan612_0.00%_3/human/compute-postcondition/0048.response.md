Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, and the input to the loop must be a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, splits the string into individual elements, converts each element back to an integer, and stores them in the list `ar`. The values of `minn`, `t`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
