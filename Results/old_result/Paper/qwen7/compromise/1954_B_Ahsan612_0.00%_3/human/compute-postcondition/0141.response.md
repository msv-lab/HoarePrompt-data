Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) and returns whether the array `a` is beautiful.**

This means the function is designed to validate a series of test cases, each containing a value `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It checks if the array `a` meets the criteria to be considered "beautiful" and returns a result based on this check.
