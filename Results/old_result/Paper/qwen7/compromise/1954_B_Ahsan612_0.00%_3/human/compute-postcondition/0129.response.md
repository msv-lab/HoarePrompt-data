Postcondition: `minn` is 1 or 2, `same` is 2, `num` is either `ar[0]`, `ar[i-1]`, or `ar[5]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is less than 6, and `len(ar)` is 6 if `ar[i] == num`; otherwise, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `len(ar)` is 6.
