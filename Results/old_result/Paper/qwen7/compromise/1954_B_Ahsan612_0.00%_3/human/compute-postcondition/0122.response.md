Output State: **`minn` is 1 or 2, `same` is 1, 2, or 3, `num` is either `ar[0]`, `ar[i-1]`, or `ar[5]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is 6, and `len(ar)` is greater than 5.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `i` while keeping the rest of the initial state conditions intact.
