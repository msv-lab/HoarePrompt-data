Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is 3, `num` is now set to `ar[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
