Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 2, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
