Output State: **`minn` is 2, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[4]` equals `num`, `num` is `ar[5]`, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`minn` which is 1) and the value of `same`. Since `same` is either 2 or 1, and `minn` is initially 1, `minn` will remain 1 if `same` is 2, or it will become 1 if `same` is 1 (since 1 is less than 2). However, since `same` is given as either 2 or 1, and 1 is less than 2, `minn` will be updated to 1 if `same` is 1, but it remains 2 if `same` is 2. Therefore, `minn` is now 2. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
