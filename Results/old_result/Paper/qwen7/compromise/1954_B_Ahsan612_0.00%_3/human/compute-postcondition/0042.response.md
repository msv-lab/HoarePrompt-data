Postcondition: **`same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `num` is the last element of `ar`. The minimum value `minn` is not infinity.**
