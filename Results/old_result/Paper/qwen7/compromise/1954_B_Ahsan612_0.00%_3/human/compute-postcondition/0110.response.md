Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (infinity) and `same` (1), `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 3, and `same` is now 1.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `same` to 1, which does not change its value since it was already 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
