Output State: **`i` is either 7, 8, or 9, `same` is either 1, 3, or 4, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 4, and `num` is `ar[i-1]` if `ar[i-1] == num`. If `ar[i-1] != num`, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1 if `i` is 8, and `num` is `ar[i-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was either 6, 7, or 8. After incrementing, `i` will now be either 7, 8, or 9. The other variables (`same`, `minn`, and `num`) remain unchanged according to the provided conditions unless they are explicitly modified by the subsequent code, which is not present here.
