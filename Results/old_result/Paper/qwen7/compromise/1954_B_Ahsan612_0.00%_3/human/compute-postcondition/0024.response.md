Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar` and is now the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `num` is equal to `ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
