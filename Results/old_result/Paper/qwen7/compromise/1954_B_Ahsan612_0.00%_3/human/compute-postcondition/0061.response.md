Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1); `ar` is a list of integers created from the input; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 3; `num` is `ar[2]`; `same` is 1; and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (infinity) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Since infinity is greater than 1, `minn` will now be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
