Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input()))`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop.
   - If `minn` was initially infinity, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `minn` is now a finite value.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop will run. Given that we are at the end of the previous iteration, the input for the next iteration will determine the number of remaining iterations.
   - The variables `i`, `minn`, `same`, and `num` are not directly affected by the loop control mechanism (i.e., they are not part of the loop head). Therefore, these variables remain as they are unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided here.
   - The only thing that changes is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the input for the next iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input for the next iteration. Let's denote the input for the next iteration as `k`.

**State:**
- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
- `same` is 1.
- `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop.
- The loop will run `k` more times, where `k` is the integer input for the next iteration.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop, and the loop will run `k` more times, where `k` is the integer input for the next iteration.**
