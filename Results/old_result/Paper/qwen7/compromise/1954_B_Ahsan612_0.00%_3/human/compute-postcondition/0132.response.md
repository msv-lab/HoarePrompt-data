Output State: `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `num` is either `ar[0]`, `ar[i-1]`, or `ar[5]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with the full list of integers from the input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `len(ar)` is the total number of integers in the input.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the array `ar`. The variable `minn` will retain its minimum value found during the loop, which is either 1 or 2 based on the conditions met. The variable `same` will be 1 because the loop increments `same` to 1 when it encounters a different element than `num`. The variable `num` will be the last element of the array `ar` or one of the initial elements (`ar[0]` or `ar[5]`), depending on the sequence of elements in the array. The array `ar` will contain all the integers provided as input, and `i` will be equal to the length of this array.
