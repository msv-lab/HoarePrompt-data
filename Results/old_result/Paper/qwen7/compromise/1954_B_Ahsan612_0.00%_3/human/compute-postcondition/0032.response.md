Output State: **`same` is either 2 or 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar` and is now the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is `i + 1` and is less than `len(ar) - 1`, `num` is the value of `ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `same`. Since `same` is either 2 or 3, `minn` will be updated to the smaller of its current value and either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
