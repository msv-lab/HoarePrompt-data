Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
- `same` is 1.
- `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended; otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop.
- The current value of `minn` is infinity.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will directly print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
