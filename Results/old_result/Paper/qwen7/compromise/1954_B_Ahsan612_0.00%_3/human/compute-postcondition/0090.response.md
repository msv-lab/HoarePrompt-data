Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop, and `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop.
