Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to check if the entire array can be reduced to zeros. The program only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions and prints 'NO' immediately if these conditions are not met, but it does not ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zeros through the allowed operations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```
The program will output "NO" because the first element (2) is odd and the second element (4) is not equal to 2 + 2. However, it is possible to reduce this array to all zeros using the allowed operations. Here's one way to do it:
1. Apply the operation at i=3: [2, 4, 3, 3, 1] → [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]
2. Apply the operation at i=3: [2, 3, 2, 2, 1] → [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]
3. Apply the operation at i=2: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1] → [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
4. Apply the operation at i=3: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] → [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
5. Apply the operation at i=4: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] → [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Since the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this valid case, it is not correct.
