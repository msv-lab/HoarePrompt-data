Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`; `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1, and `t` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is taken as an input integer, which is used to determine the length of the list `nums`.
