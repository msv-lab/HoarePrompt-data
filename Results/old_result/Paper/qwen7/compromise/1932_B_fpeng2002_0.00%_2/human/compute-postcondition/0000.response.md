Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**

The code reads the number of test cases from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
