Output State: `start_year` is the result of applying the operation `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, and `x` is the last index processed, which is `len(nums) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be the final value obtained by sequentially applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element `nums[x]` in the list `nums`, where `x` ranges from 0 to the length of `nums` minus one. The variable `x` will hold the value of the last index processed, which is the total number of elements in the list `nums` minus one.
