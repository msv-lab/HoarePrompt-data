Output State: **`start_year` is ((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `x` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `x` is 0, the expression becomes `((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. The value of `x` remains unchanged at 0. The initial state condition that `nums` must have at least one element is still valid.
