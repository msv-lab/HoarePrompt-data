You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` is the result of applying the operation `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one, with `x` being equal to the length of the `nums` list minus one after all iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list. The variable `start_year` will hold the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one. This means that `start_year` will undergo a series of updates, each time incorporating the next element in the `nums` list, until all elements have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by three components: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a list `a` containing `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
