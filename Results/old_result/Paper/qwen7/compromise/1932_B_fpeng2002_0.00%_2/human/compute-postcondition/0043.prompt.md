Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `start_year` is the result of applying the operation ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for each `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums)` - 1, with `x` taking on each value in that range in sequence, and `x` is `len(nums)` - 1 after all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one. The variable `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list minus one after all iterations have completed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, `len(nums)`, and `start_year` is ((((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]).

To understand this output state, let's break down the loop operation. The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list, updating the `start_year` variable based on the current value of `start_year` and the current element in the `nums` list. After each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1, eventually reaching the length of the `nums` list.

Starting with `start_year` as 0, the loop updates `start_year` as follows:
1. First iteration: `start_year` becomes (((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0])
2. Second iteration: `start_year` becomes ((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])
3. Third iteration: `start_year` becomes ((((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2])

This pattern continues until the loop has executed `len(nums)` times, at which point `x` will be equal to `len(nums)` and `start_year` will be the final value calculated through the series of operations described above.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list; `start_year` is ((((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]) + 1) // nums[-1] + 1) * nums[-1].

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list because the loop runs from 0 to len(nums) - 1. The final value of `start_year` will be calculated by applying the loop's operation to the last element of `nums`. Specifically, it starts with the value of `start_year` after the third iteration and continues the operation for each subsequent element of `nums`, ending with the last element.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
