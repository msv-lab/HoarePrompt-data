Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `x` and the range it iterates over, which is `range(0, len(nums))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`.
   - `x` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for each value of `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be 1.
   - The value of `start_year` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `start_year` within the loop.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `x`.

**Final State**:
State: **`start_year` is ((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `x` is 1**
