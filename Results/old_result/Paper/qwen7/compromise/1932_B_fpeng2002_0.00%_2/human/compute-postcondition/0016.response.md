Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `start_year` is the result of applying the operation ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for each x in the range from 0 to len(nums) - 1, with x taking on each value in that range in sequence.**

Explanation: The line `num_tests -= 1` decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1. The value of `start_year` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `start_year` directly. It only modifies `num_tests`.
