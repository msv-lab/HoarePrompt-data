Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `start_year` is the result of applying the operation ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for each x in the range from 0 to len(nums) - 1, with x taking on each value in that range in sequence, and `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and splits it into a list of integers, which is assigned to the variable `nums`. The values of `num_tests` and `start_year` remain unchanged from their previous values.
