Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `x` is 0
- `start_year` is \(((start_year + 1) // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)\)

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The variable `x` is the loop variable and it starts from 0 and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, so `x` should become 1.

### Adjusting the State
- Since `x` is the only variable in the loop head, we only need to adjust its value.
- The value of `start_year` does not change within the loop itself, so it remains the same.

### New State
- `x` becomes 1.
- `start_year` remains as \(((start_year + 1) // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)\).

### Final Answer
State: **`x` is 1, `start_year` is \(((start_year + 1) // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)\)**
