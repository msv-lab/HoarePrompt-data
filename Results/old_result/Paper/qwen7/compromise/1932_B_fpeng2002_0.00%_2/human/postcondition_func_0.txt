The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of integers in a list `a`, and the list `a` itself containing `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a final value for `start_year` by iteratively applying a specific formula to each element in the list `a`. The final value of `start_year` is then printed for each test case.
