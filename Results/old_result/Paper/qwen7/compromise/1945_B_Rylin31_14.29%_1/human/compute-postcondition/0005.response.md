Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)). For each test case, it calculates a value \(mn\) as the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) plus \(m\). It then checks if \(m\) is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\) without either being 1. If the condition is met, it prints \(mn // a + mn // b + 1\); otherwise, it prints \(mn // a + mn // b\). The function outputs a sequence of integers, one for each test case.**
