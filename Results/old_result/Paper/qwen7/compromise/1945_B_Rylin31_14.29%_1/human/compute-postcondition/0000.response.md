Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the output state remains consistent with this constraint. All other variables remain unaffected.
