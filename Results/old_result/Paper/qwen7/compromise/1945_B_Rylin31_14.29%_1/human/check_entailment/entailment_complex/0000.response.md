Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case, reading the values \( a \), \( b \), and \( m \).

2. **Calculation of \( mn \)**: The variable \( mn \) is calculated as \( \text{min}(a, b) + m \). This is correct because it represents the time after which the next simultaneous launch would occur if the fireworks were launched immediately after the last simultaneous launch.

3. **Divisibility Check**: The program checks if \( m \) is divisible by both \( a \) and \( b \) without either being 1. This is a crucial part of determining whether the fireworks from both installations coincide exactly at some point within the visibility period.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - If \( m \) is divisible by both \( a \) and \( b \) and neither \( a \) nor \( b \) is 1, the program prints \( \frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b} + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b} \).

This approach ensures that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is correctly calculated. The logic accounts for the exact synchronization of launches and the visibility period of the fireworks.

Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the program accurately computes the required output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
