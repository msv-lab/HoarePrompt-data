Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit; `x` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`; `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` adds the integer value of `x` to `sum_value_digits`. Since `x` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`, and `i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit, the value of `sum_value_digits` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
