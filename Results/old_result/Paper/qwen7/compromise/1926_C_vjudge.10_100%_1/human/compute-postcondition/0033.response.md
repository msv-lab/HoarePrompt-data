Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit, `x` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the previous `x` and now equals the integer value of the current `x`.**

This means that the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated to include the integer value of the current `x`. All other variables remain in their initial conditions relative to the initial state description.
