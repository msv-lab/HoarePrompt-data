Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum_value_digits` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `inf`, `values`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `sum_value_digits` is updated to 0.
