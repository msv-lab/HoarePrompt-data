Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `i`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is a positive integer and its string representation is non-empty.
   - `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the current digit `x`.

4. **Analyze the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` would be the last digit of the string representation of `i`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` should still have digits left to process.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is the last digit processed, `i` should now be the remaining part of the string after removing the last digit.
   - `sum_value_digits` remains unchanged as it is only updated inside the loop body with the value of `x`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `i` is now the string representation of `i` without the last digit.
- `sum_value_digits` remains the same as it was incremented by the last digit but not yet updated in the next iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`i` is a positive integer and its string representation is non-empty (but one digit shorter than before), `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the current digit `x`.** 

However, to provide a concrete example, if `i` was "123" and `x` was "3", then `i` would become "12" and `sum_value_digits` would remain the same.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`i` is a positive integer and its string representation is non-empty (but one digit shorter than before), `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the current digit `x`.**
