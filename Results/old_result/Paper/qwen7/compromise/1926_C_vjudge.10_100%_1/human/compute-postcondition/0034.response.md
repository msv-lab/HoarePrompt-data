Output State: `i` is a positive integer + 1, `x` is the last digit of the string representation of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits in the string representation of `i`, `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` remains a positive integer + 1. The variable `x` will be the last digit of the final value of `i`. The variable `sum_value_digits` will hold the sum of all digits in the string representation of the final value of `i`. Finally, `values[i + 1]` will be updated to be equal to `values[i]` plus the sum of all digits in the string representation of `i`.
