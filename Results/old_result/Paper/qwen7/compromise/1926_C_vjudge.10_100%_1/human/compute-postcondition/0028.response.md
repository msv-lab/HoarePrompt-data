Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit, `x` is the current digit being processed, `sum_value_digits` is the original `sum_value_digits` plus the integer value of `x`, `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`**.

This means that the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated by adding the integer value of `x` to its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
