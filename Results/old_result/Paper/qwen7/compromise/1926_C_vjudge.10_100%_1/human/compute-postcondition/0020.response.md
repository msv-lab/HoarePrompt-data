Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is a positive integer.
- `x` is the next digit of `i`.
- `sum_value_digits` is the original value of `sum_value_digits` plus the integer value of `x`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for x in str(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each digit of `i`. Therefore, the variable `x` takes on each digit of `i` in sequence.
2. **State Adjustments**: 
   - `i` remains unchanged within the loop because the loop is iterating over its digits, not modifying it.
   - `x` changes with each iteration, taking on the next digit of `i`.
   - `sum_value_digits` is updated by adding the integer value of `x` to it during each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the next digit of `i`.
- For the next iteration, `x` will be the next digit of `i` after the current one.
- `sum_value_digits` will be updated by adding the integer value of the new `x` to it.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `i` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `x` will be the next digit of `i` after the current one.
- `sum_value_digits` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the integer value of the current `x`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is a positive integer, `x` is the next digit of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is the original value of `sum_value_digits` plus the integer value of the current `x`**.

To be more specific:
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `x` will be the next digit of `i` after the current one.
- `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of all previously processed digits plus the integer value of the current `x`.

So, the final state can be represented as:
State: **`i` is a positive integer, `x` is the next digit of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is the original value of `sum_value_digits` plus the integer value of the current `x`**.
