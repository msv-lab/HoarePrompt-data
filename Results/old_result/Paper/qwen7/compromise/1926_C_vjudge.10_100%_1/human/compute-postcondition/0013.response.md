Output State: **`i` is a positive integer whose string representation has been fully processed, `sum_value_digits` contains the sum of all digits of `i`, and `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.**

This means that the value of `values[i]` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (`values[i - 1]`) and the `sum_value_digits` of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
