Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit.
   - `x` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over each digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - The loop variable `x` takes on the value of each digit in the string representation of `i`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` has taken on the value of one of the digits in the string representation of `i`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to take on the value of the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` remains unchanged because the loop is iterating over its digits, not modifying it.
   - `x` will now be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - `sum_value_digits` will remain unchanged because the loop body has not yet incremented it in this new iteration.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is still a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit.
   - `x` is now the next digit in the string representation of `i` (the digit following the one processed in the previous iteration).
   - `sum_value_digits` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit, `x` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the previous `x`**.
