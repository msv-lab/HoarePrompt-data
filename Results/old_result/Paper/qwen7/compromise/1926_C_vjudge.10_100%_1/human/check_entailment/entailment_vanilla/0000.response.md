Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `inf` to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\).
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It creates a list `values` of size `inf` initialized to 0.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to `inf`, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - It updates the `values` list such that `values[i]` stores the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `i`.

3. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints `values[n]`, which is the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Precomputation Logic:**
   - The precomputation logic is correct. For each number `i`, it correctly calculates the sum of its digits and updates the cumulative sum in the `values` array.
   - This ensures that `values[i]` contains the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The test case handling is also correct. For each test case, it correctly uses the precomputed values to get the required sum for the range 1 to `n`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles large values of `n` up to \(2 \times 10^5\) efficiently due to the precomputation.
   - The input constraints are respected, and the program should work within the given time limit (0.5 seconds).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution by precomputing the cumulative sum of digit sums and using these precomputed values to answer each test case efficiently.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
