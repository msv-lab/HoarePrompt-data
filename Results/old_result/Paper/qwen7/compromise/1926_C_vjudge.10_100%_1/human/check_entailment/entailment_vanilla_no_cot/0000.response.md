Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Time Complexity**: The program precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores them in an array `values`. This approach is inefficient because it takes \(O(n \log n)\) time to compute the sum of digits for each number, leading to a total time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which is not feasible within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds for large values of \(n\).

2. **Incorrect Approach**: Instead of precomputing the sums, the problem can be solved more efficiently by directly calculating the sum of the digits for each number in the range when needed. 

3. **Redundant Array**: The array `values` is unnecessary and leads to excessive memory usage.

Here's a more efficient solution:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        current_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
            current_sum += digit_sum
        print(current_sum)

func_1()
```

This solution iterates through each number from 1 to \(n\) and calculates the sum of its digits directly, updating the running total. This approach ensures that the solution is both time and space efficient.
