Functionality: **The function reads an integer `casos` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. Depending on the value of `n`, it prints a specific pattern consisting of "#" and "." characters. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of "##". If `n` is 2, it prints four lines with specific patterns. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines with specific patterns. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines with specific patterns. If `n` is greater than 4, it prints "No esta en el rango" for each case. The function does not return anything and only outputs the patterns or the out-of-range message.**
