Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the output cases provided, it appears that the function does not actually take any parameters. The constraints mentioned (t and n being integers within specific ranges) seem to be related to test cases or input data rather than parameters of the function itself. Since no parameters are listed in the function definition and no parameters are described in the question, we conclude that the function does not accept any parameters and therefore has no return value either.
