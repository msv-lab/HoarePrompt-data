Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases (n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=4) and includes a fallback message for other values of `n`. However, the problem description requires generating a 2n Ã— 2n checkerboard for any `n` within the range [1, 20]. The program fails to generate the correct pattern for `n > 4`, such as `n=5` or `n=6`, which are also within the valid range. For instance, for `n=5`, the output should be a 10x10 checkerboard, but the program does not handle this case correctly.
