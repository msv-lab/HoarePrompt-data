Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`.
   - The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python when you don't care about the value of the iterator.
   - The variable `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: The initial state is given as `t` is an input integer. This means `t` is already set to some integer value before the loop starts.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Once `t` becomes 0, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
