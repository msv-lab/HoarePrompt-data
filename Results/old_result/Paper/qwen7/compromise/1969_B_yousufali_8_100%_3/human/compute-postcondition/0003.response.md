Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, a binary string `s` is provided, with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, consisting only of '0's and '1's. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes each test case, analyzing the provided binary string `s`.**
