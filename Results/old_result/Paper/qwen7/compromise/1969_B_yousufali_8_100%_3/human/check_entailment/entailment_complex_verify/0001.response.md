### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. A cyclic shift of a substring costs the length of that substring.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - It iterates through the string:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is indeed flawed because it does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - The function incorrectly calculates the cost by simply adding the length of substrings starting from a '1' and ending just before a '0'. This approach does not reflect the true cost of sorting the string using cyclic shifts.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For "10", the function correctly calculates the cost as 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly calculates the cost as 0.
   - For "11000", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 4 instead of 3.
   - For "101011", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 instead of 9.
   - For "01101001", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 8 instead of 11.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The provided examples demonstrate that the function fails to compute the correct cost in several cases.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions within `func_1`, but it does not address the logical flaw in the cost calculation.
   - The overall structure of `func_2` is correct in terms of processing multiple test cases, but it relies on the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
