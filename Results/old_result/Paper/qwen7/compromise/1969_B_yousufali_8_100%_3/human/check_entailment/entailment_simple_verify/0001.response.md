### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. A cyclic shift of a substring costs the length of that substring.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - It iterates through the string:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is indeed flawed because it does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - The function `func_1` assumes that every '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's requires a separate cyclic shift of the entire sequence of '1's plus the '0'. This is incorrect because the optimal strategy involves identifying the smallest possible cyclic shifts to move '0's to their correct positions.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For "10", the function correctly calculates the cost as 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly calculates the cost as 0.
   - For "11000", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 4 instead of 3.
   - For "101011", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 instead of 9.
   - For "01101001", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 8 instead of 11.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the positions of '0's and '1's and determine the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move each '0' to its correct position.
   - The correct approach involves iterating through the string and counting the number of '1's before each '0' and then calculating the cost based on these counts.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. It fails to account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order.

### Correctness:
