### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. A cyclic shift of a substring from index \( l \) to \( r \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string `s`.
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The state before the function call is a binary string `s`, an integer `n` initialized to 0, and an integer `ans` initialized to 0.
  - The function iterates through the string `s`.
    - When it encounters a '1', it increments `n`.
    - When it encounters a '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
  - The state after the function call is that `ans` is the sum of all substrings starting from a '1' and ending just before a '0'.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The state before the function call is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - The state after the function call is that `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` is called `t` times.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment states that the provided function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all possible cases. Let's verify this claim.

Consider the example "101011":
- The function would count the transitions between '0' and '1', resulting in a cost of 5 (as there are four transitions).
- However, the optimal solution involves performing three cyclic shifts:
  1. Shift "101011" to "010111" (cost 2)
  2. Shift "010111" to "101110" (cost 2)
  3. Shift "101110" to "011101" (cost 2)

The total cost is 6, not 5. Therefore, the provided function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for this case.

However, the original assessment seems to have overlooked the fact that the function `func_1` does not always produce the correct result. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of all substrings starting from a '1' and ending just before a '0', which is not necessarily the minimum cost to sort the string.

To verify the correctness, let's consider another example:
- Consider the string "1100101".
- The function would count the transitions between '0' and '1', resulting in a cost of 7 (as there are six transitions).
- The optimal solution involves performing four cyclic shifts:
  1. Shift "1100101" to "0110011" (cost 3)
  2. Shift "0110011" to "1011001" (cost 3)
  3. Shift "1011001" to "0110011" (cost 3)
  4. Shift "0110011" to "1100110" (cost 3)

The total cost is 12, not 7. Therefore, the provided function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for this case either.

Given these examples, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
