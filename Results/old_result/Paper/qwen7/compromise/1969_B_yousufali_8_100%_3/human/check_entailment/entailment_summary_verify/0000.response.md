### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

- The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
- It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of consecutive '1's encountered and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
- It iterates through the string `s`:
  - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
  - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

- The function `func_2` takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases.
- It then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_2` processes a specified number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case. It does not return any value.

#### Evaluation:
The original assessment stated that the provided program does not correctly implement the solution because it does not account for the optimal number of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. Let's verify this claim.

Consider the example string "101011":
- The function `func_1` would count the transitions between '0' and '1', resulting in a cost of 5 (as there are four transitions).
- However, the optimal solution involves performing three cyclic shifts:
  1. Shift "101011" to "010111" (cost 2)
  2. Shift "010111" to "101110" (cost 2)
  3. Shift "101110" to "011101" (cost 2)

The total cost is 6, not 5. This indicates that the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all possible cases.

However, let's re-evaluate the logic of `func_1`:
- The function counts the number of '0's followed by '1's and adds the length of the segment plus one to the cost.
- This approach is actually correct for calculating the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts. Here's why:
  - Each '0' followed by '1' represents a boundary where a cyclic shift can be performed to move the '1' to the left.
  - The cost of moving a '1' to the left is the length of the segment from the previous '1' to the current '0'.
  - Summing these costs gives the minimum total cost to sort the string.

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. The original assessment was inaccurate.
