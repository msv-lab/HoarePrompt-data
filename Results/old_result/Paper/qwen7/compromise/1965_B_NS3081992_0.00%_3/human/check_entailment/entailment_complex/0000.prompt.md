Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `rows` (between 1 and 25) and returns a list of length `rows`. Each element in the list is the result of calling the function `func_7()` one time for each iteration in the range defined by `rows`.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, and the function does not take any arguments. This suggests that the function `func_9` might be part of a larger program or framework where it is called with appropriate inputs, but based solely on the function itself, no preconditions can be derived from the given signature.
def func_9():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts no parameters and returns the input provided by the user.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; processing is a list of zeros and ones with the same length as the maximum value in d's keys plus one; da is an integer representing a key in the dictionary d; rank is a list of integers with the same length as the maximum value in d's keys plus one.

The `processing` list and `rank` list remain unchanged except for the temporary modifications within the loop.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` processes a dictionary `d` and modifies a `processing` list based on the values in `d`. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1 immediately. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum value of a temporary variable `tmp` by setting elements in the `processing` list to 1 and checking the results. Finally, it updates the `rank` list with `tmp + 1` and returns this updated value.

#Function 13:

    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that b is greater than 0 and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b is 1
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns y, x - a // b * y, and g, where x, y, and g are the results of the function call func_13(b, a % b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers with `b` being greater than 0 and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` being 1. Depending on the value of `b`, it either directly returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` unchanged (with `b` becoming 0), or it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` to compute `x`, `y`, and `g`. Finally, it returns `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. In both cases, the function ensures that the gcd of `a` and `b` remains 1.

    #State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` is 1, then `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8]. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk), 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^l], where `lk` is the length of `bk`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
