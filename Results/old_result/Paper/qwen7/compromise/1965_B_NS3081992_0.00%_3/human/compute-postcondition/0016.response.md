Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `bk`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `b`, `k`, `l`, and `bk` remain unchanged from their initial states.
