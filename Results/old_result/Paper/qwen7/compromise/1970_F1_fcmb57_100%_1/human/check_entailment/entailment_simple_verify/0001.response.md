### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the initial state of the field and the movements. It correctly identifies players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
   - The parsing logic for players, goals, and the Quaffle is accurate and handles the constraints \(3 \leq N, M \leq 99\) and \(N, M\) being odd.

2. **Player Movements**:
   - The program updates player positions correctly using the `func_1` function, which adds movement vectors to the player's current position.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the new position of a player based on the movement direction.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player carries the Quaffle and reaches the opponent's goal, the appropriate team scores a point and the Quaffle returns to the center of the field.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the scoring logic. The program checks if the player is in the opponent's goal, but it does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle. If a player without the Quaffle enters the opponent's goal, the program incorrectly increments the score for the opponent.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the correct events in the required format and outputs the final score at the end of the game.
   - The output format is consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided examples cover various scenarios, including different team scores, correct and incorrect goals, and multiple steps. However, the examples do not cover the scenario where a player without the Quaffle scores in the opponent's goal, which would cause the program to incorrectly increment the score.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete. While the program handles most aspects of the problem correctly, it fails to properly check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring. This oversight leads to incorrect scoring in certain scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the condition where a player without the Quaffle scores in the opponent's goal, leading to incorrect scoring.
