Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and the last element is also `k-1` with `k` being less than or equal to 0.**

This means that the list `nums` contains `n` elements, all of which are equal to `k-1`, and since `k` is less than or equal to 0, `k-1` will also be a non-positive integer. The last element of the list, `nums[-1]`, is specifically noted to be `k-1`.
