Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is defined and positive; the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta` is a list containing the value 0.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 0) to the list `eta`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is still 0, `n` remains defined and positive, and the current value of `q[j]` is still greater than 0. The list `eta` now contains the value 0.
