Postcondition: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is equal to 1, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from `n-1` down to `0`) for which `q[j]` was greater than 0 at any point during the loop's execution, `j` is `-1`, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `eta_ln` is not 1, the loop will continue to execute until either `j` reaches `eta_ln` or `j` exceeds 1000. After all iterations, `res` will be the sum of all the increments made to it during each iteration, `rho` will be the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values encountered during the loop, and `j` will be equal to `eta_ln` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking due to `j > 1000`.**
