Postcondition: `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `j` is within the range [1, eta_ln), `eta_ln` is greater than 1; `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, and if `j` is greater than 1000, the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
