Postcondition: `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and then further increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, and the current value of `j` is greater than 1000, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
