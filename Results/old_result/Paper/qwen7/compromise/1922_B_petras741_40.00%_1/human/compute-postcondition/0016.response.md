Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, `eta` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `eta`. None of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The only new variable `eta` is created and set to an empty list.
