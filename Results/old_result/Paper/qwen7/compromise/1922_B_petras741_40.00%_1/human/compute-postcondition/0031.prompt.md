Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, `eta` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n + 1):
    if q[j] > 0:
        eta.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `eta` is a list containing `j`, and if `q[j]` is greater than 0, the current value of `q[j]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta` now contains the value of `j` appended to it. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, `eta` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `q[j + 1]` is greater than 0, and `eta` now contains the value of `j + 1` appended to it if `q[j + 1]` is greater than 0; otherwise, `eta` remains unchanged, and in either case, `eta` is further updated by appending `j` to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
