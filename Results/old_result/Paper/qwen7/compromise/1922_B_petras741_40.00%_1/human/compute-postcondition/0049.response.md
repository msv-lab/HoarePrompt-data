Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `eta_ln`, meaning `j` should be incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `eta_ln`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and then further increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`.
   - The current value of `j` is greater than 1000.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to continue, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` should be less than `eta_ln`. Given that `j` was greater than 1000 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `j + 1` must still be less than `eta_ln`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `res` remains unchanged as no information is provided about its change in the next iteration.
   - `rho` remains unchanged as no information is provided about its change in the next iteration.
   - `j` is updated to `j + 1`.
   - The condition `j < eta_ln` must hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and then further increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j` must be less than `eta_ln`.**
