Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to -1, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` where `q[j]` was greater than 0 during the loop's iterations.**

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the variable `j` will be set to -1 because the loop has completed its iterations, and `eta` will contain a list of all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where the corresponding `q[j]` was greater than 0 during the loop's execution. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `w`, and `q`) retain their postconditions from the last iteration, meaning `t` remains at least 1, `n` remains the initial value after the loop, `w` retains the list of integers from the input string split, and `q` retains its structure with `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is `n`.
