Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is equal to 1.
   - `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from `n-1` down to `0`) for which `q[j]` was greater than 0 at any point during the loop's execution.
   - `j` is `-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
   ```

Given that `eta_ln` is 1, it means `eta` contains only one element. Since `j` is `-1`, the only element in `eta` is `-1`.

3. **Determine `rho`:**
   - `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, which is `q[-1]`.

4. **Evaluate the Print Statement:**
   - The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{3}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items without regard to order.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than 0, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 1 (since `n > 0` and `n` is an integer). However, \(\binom{1}{3} = 0\), because you cannot choose 3 items from only 1 item.
   - For `n = 2`, \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (same reasoning).
   - For `n = 3`, \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\).

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `n`, but it must be greater than 0, the smallest valid value for `n` is 3 (as smaller values would result in 0).

Therefore, the expression evaluates to:
\[ 3 * (3 - 1) * (3 - 2) // 6 = 3 * 2 * 1 // 6 = 6 // 6 = 1 \]

Output: **1**
