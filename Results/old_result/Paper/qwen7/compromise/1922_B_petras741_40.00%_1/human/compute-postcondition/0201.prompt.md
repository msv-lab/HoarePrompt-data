Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and the value of t is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `t` is at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to `eta_ln` (which is 1), `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` where `q[j]` was greater than 0 during the loop's iterations, and either the length of `eta` is 1 and `rho` is set to `q[eta[0]]`, or the loop has completed all iterations (or stopped due to `j > 1000`) with `res` being the sum of all increments, `rho` being the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values, and `j` is equal to `eta_ln`. If `n` is less than 3, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 1, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, then `j` is an integer, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[0]`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, then `j` remains `n-1`, `eta_ln` remains 1, `res` is 0, and `rho` is `q[0]`. Otherwise, after the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `min(eta_ln, 1001)`, `eta_ln` remains unchanged and must be greater than 1, `res` will be the sum of all terms added in each iteration according to the loop, and `rho` will be the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values added in each iteration. If `n` is less than 3, then `t`, `n`, `w`, and `i` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `t` is at least 1, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 2, `j` is -1, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from `n-1` down to `0`) for which `q[j]` was greater than 0 at any point during the loop's execution, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is equal to 1, `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values encountered during the loop, and `res` is the sum of all the increments made to it during each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
