Output State: **`j` is 1; `n` is defined and positive; `eta` is a list containing 1.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `eta`. Since `j` is 1 and `n` is defined and positive, these values remain unchanged. The list `eta` now contains the value 1.
