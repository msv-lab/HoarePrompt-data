Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is at least 1, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 2, `j` is undefined, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[0]`, `w` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `w` by converting each element of the input string (split by spaces) into an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
