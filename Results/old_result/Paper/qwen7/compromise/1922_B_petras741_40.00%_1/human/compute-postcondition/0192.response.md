Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `rho` is equal to `rho + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `res` has been updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its current value, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `rho` has been updated to `rho + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]`. After executing the `break` statement, the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in.
