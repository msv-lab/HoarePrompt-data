Output State: **`eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `eta` will be a list containing all indices `j` (from `n-1` down to `0`) for which `q[j]` was greater than 0 at any point during the loop's execution, `j` is `-1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `eta_ln = len(eta)` calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns it to the variable `eta_ln`. The values of `eta`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
