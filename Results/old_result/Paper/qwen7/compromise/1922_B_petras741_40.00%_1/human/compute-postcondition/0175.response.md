Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `j` is within the range [1, eta_ln), `eta_ln` is greater than 1; `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`.**

Explanation: The code `rho += q[eta[j]]` increments the value of `rho` by `q[eta[j]]`. The other variables (`res`, `j`, `eta_ln`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
