Output State: `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now 5, `j` is `n`.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains at least 1, `n` remains at least 3, and `w` remains as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string. The list `q` has been incremented at the index `w[0]` for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `n` times, the value at `q[w[0]]` will be incremented `n` times, resulting in a value of `n`. Given that the output state after 3 iterations shows `q[w[0]]` as 3, after `n` iterations, `q[w[0]]` will be `n`. The variable `j`, which is the loop counter, will be equal to `n` after the loop completes all its iterations.
