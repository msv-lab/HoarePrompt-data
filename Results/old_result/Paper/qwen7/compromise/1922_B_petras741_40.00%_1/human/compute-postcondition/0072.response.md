Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `w`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
