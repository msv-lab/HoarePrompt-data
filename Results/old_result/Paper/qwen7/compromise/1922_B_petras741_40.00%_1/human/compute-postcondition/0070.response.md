Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is at least 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, then:
     - `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.
     - `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.
     - `t` is at least 1.
     - `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop.
     - `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
     - `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`.
     - `j` is equal to `eta_ln` (which is 1).
     - `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` where `q[j]` was greater than 0 during the loop's iterations.
     - Either the length of `eta` is 1 and `rho` is set to `q[eta[0]]`, or the loop has completed all iterations (or stopped due to `j > 1000`) with `res` being the sum of all increments, `rho` being the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values, and `j` is equal to `eta_ln`.
   - If `n` is less than 3, then:
     - `t` is at least 1.
     - `n` is an input integer.
     - `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is 1**.
