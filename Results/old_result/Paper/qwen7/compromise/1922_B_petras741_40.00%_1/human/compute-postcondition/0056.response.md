Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(1, eta_ln)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j < eta_ln`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * 2`.
   - `j` is increased by 1.
   - If `j` is greater than 1000, we break out of the loop.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `j` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < eta_ln` and `j` is not greater than 1000.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `j`.
   - The new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

6. **Consider the Break Condition:**
   - If `j` becomes greater than 1000, the loop will break. However, since we are considering the state just before the next iteration, we assume `j` is still within the range and not yet greater than 1000.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * 2`, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is now `j + 1`**.
