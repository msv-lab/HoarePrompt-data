Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `j` will take values from `0` to `n-1` during the loop execution.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Current States**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `t` is at least 1 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string.
   - `i` is 2 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `j` is undefined (we need to set this to the initial value it will take in the first iteration).
   - `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order if `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `eta_ln` is 1 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `rho` is `q[0]` (not relevant for the loop).
   - `q` is now a list of length `n+1` where each element is 0.
   - `w` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string (not relevant for the loop).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be initialized to `0` (the starting value).
   - `n` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 0) for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` to `0` and `n` to be greater than or equal to 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
