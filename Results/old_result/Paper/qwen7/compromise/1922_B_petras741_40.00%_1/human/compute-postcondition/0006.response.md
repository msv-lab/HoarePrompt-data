Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer with a value of at least 3, and `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string; `q` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `q`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `w`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
