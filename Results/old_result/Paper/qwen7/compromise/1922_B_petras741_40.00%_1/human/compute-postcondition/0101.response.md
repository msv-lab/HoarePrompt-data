Given the initial state:
- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is defined and positive
- `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order
- `eta_ln` is 1
- `rho` is `q[0]`

We need to evaluate the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `n`**: Since `j` is `n-1`, we can express `n` as `j + 1`. Given that `n` is defined and positive, `j` must also be a non-negative integer.

2. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - Substitute `n` with `j + 1` in the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.
   - This becomes `(j + 1) * j * (j - 1) // 6`.

3. **Simplification**:
   - The expression simplifies to \((j + 1) * j * (j - 1) // 6\).

Since `j` is a non-negative integer, let's denote `j` as `k` for simplicity. Therefore, the expression becomes \((k + 1) * k * (k - 1) // 6\).

The value of this expression depends on the specific value of `j` (or `k`). However, without a specific value for `j`, we can only describe the expression in terms of `j`.

Output: **(j + 1) * j * (j - 1) // 6**
