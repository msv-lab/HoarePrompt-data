Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range `0` to `n + 1` (inclusive).
3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n - 1` and `n` is the initial value after the loop.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n`.
- `n` remains the same as its initial value after the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `eta` is a list containing `j`.**

Note that `q[j]` is greater than 0, but since `j` is now `n`, this condition does not affect the loop continuation.
