Output State: **`j` is 2; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given the initial state where `j` is 2 and `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, it means that `q[w[2]]` is now one more than its original value. The variable `j` remains unchanged at 2.
