Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`, `j` is `j + 1`, `rho` is equal to `rho + q[eta[j]]`, and `j` must be less than `eta_ln`.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. It also increments `j` by 1 and updates `rho` by adding `q[eta[j]]` to its current value. The condition that `j` must be less than `eta_ln` remains unchanged.
