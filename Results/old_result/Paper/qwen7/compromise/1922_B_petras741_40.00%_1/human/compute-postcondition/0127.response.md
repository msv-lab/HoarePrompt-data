Output State: **The loop will execute until `j` reaches `eta_ln - 1` or when `j` exceeds 1000, whichever comes first. After all iterations, `j` will be equal to `min(eta_ln, 1001)`, `eta_ln` will remain unchanged and must be greater than 1, `res` will be the sum of all terms added in each iteration according to the loop, `rho` will be the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values added in each iteration. If `j` does not exceed 1000, the loop will complete all iterations up to `eta_ln - 1`. If `j` exceeds 1000 before completing all iterations, the loop will break early.**

In more detail, `res` will be updated as follows:
- For each `j` from 1 to `min(eta_ln - 1, 1000)`, `res` will be incremented by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and then by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.
- `rho` will be incremented by `q[eta[j]]` for each iteration.

If `eta_ln` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop will execute for all elements in `eta`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1000, the loop will execute for the first 1000 elements.
