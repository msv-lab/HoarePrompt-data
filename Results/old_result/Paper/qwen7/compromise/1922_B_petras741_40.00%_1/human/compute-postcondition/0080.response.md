Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the code effectively becomes `q[w[2]] += 1`, which increments the value of `q[w[2]]` by 1. The initial conditions for `n` and `j` remain unchanged.
