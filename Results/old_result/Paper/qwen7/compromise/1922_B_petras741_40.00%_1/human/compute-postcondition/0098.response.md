Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `n` is defined and positive, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order, `eta_ln` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code `eta_ln = len(eta)` calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns it to the variable `eta_ln`. Since `eta` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, the length of `eta` is `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
