Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `eta` is a list containing `j`, and if `q[j]` is greater than 0, the current value of `q[j]` remains unchanged.
