Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer with a value of at least 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes the dictionary `q` as a list containing `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `w`, and the initial state of `q` (being an empty dictionary) remain unchanged except for the new assignment of `q`.
