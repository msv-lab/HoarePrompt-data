Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 1, `q` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `q`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `w`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
