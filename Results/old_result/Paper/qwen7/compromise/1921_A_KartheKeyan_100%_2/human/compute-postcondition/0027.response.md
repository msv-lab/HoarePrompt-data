Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range of 4. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4.

4. **Adjust the value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1.

5. **Check the conditions involving other variables**: The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `coord` do not change within the loop head and are not dependent on the loop counter `i`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above steps, the only adjustment needed is to increase `i` to 1. The conditions involving `n`, `x`, `y`, and `coord` remain the same.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**
