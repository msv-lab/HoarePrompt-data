Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 8.
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `coord` is a list containing four tuples, each tuple representing coordinates in the form (`input integer`, `input integer`).
   - `p2` is calculated as `coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]`.
   - `res` is calculated as `math.sqrt(p2)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(round(res))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `coord` is a list of four tuples, so it looks like this: `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`.
   - `p2` is calculated as the difference between the x-coordinates of the fourth and third points in `coord`, i.e., `p2 = x4 - x3`.
   - `res` is the square root of `p2`, i.e., `res = math.sqrt(x4 - x3)`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `round` function rounds `res` to the nearest integer.
   - Therefore, the output will be the rounded value of `math.sqrt(x4 - x3)`.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `x4` and `x3` are not specified, but we know they are part of the `coord` list. The output will be the rounded value of the square root of their difference.

Output: **round(math.sqrt(x4 - x3))**
