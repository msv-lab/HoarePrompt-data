Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is (x - coord[2][0]), `res` is 0, `x` is updated to the first integer input, `y` is updated to the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them by whitespace, converting each to an integer and assigning them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `i`, `n`, `coord`, and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `res` variable also remains unchanged.
