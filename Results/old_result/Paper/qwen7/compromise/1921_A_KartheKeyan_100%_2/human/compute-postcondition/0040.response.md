Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), (another input integer, an input integer), (x, y), `p2` is (x - coord[2][0]), `res` is math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(x - coord[2][0])**.

Explanation: The line `n -= 1` decrements the value of `n` by 1. Since `n` must be at least 4 initially, after decrementing, `n` will be at least 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
