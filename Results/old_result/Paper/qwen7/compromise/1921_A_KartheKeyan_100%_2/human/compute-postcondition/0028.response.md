Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(input integer, input integer)`**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `i`, `n`, and `coord` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` must still be at least 4, `x` now holds the first input integer, `y` holds the second input integer, and `coord` is a list containing a single tuple with these two integers.
