Output State: **`coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `coord = sorted(coord)` sorts the list `coord` in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple within the list. The initial state of `coord` is a list containing four tuples, each consisting of integers from the input split. After sorting, the list `coord` will be ordered based on the first elements of these tuples, while `i` remains unchanged at 5.
