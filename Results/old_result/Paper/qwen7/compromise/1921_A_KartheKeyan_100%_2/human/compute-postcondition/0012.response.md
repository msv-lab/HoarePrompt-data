Output State: **`coord` is now a list containing two tuples: the first one is (x, y) which are integers from the input split, and the second one is also (x, y); `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. Since the initial state of `coord` is a list containing two tuples `(x, y)` and the same tuple again, and `i` is 4, the values of `x` and `y` are updated from the input. However, the structure of `coord` remains the same, and `i` retains its value of 4.
