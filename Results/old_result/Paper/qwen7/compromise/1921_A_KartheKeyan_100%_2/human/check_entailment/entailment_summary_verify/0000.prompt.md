You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 100 sets of coordinates, each representing the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each set, it calculates the side lengths of the square and then computes the product of these side lengths to determine the area. Finally, it prints the rounded area for each square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the distance between two points and multiplies these distances to get the area, which is incorrect. For a square, the distance between two adjacent corners should be the side length, and the area is the side length squared. However, the program calculates the distance between diagonally opposite corners, which will give the diagonal length, not the side length. This results in an incorrect area calculation.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
0 0
1 1
0 1
1 0
```

The correct area of the square is 1, but the program will incorrectly calculate the area based on the diagonal length, which is \(\sqrt{2}\), leading to an incorrect result.
