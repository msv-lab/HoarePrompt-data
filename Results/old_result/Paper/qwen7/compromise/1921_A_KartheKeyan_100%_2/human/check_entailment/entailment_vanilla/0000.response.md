### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with four points representing the corners of the square.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list `coord`.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but this sorting might not be necessary since the coordinates are already in a format that can be directly used to compute distances.
   - The code calculates the squared distances between two pairs of adjacent corners.
   - It then takes the square root of these distances to get the side length of the square and prints the area.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic to calculate the side length of the square is flawed. The code calculates the distance between two pairs of points and multiplies their square roots, which does not give the side length of the square.
   - The correct approach would be to identify the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among all pairs of points, as these differences represent the side length of the square.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - Identify the maximum x-coordinate difference and the maximum y-coordinate difference.
   - The side length of the square is the maximum of these differences.
   - The area of the square is then the side length squared.

### Conclusion:

The given code is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square. Therefore, the output will not be accurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
