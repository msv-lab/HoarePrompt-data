Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners.
2. The provided code correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list.
4. It then sorts the coordinates, which helps in identifying the adjacent corners of the square.
5. The distances between two adjacent points (sides of the square) are calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
6. The areas are computed by taking the square root of the sum of squares of the differences in coordinates, assuming the points form the sides of the square.
7. The areas are printed after rounding.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the logic seems to be correct for calculating the area of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The code correctly identifies the side lengths and computes the area accurately.

Correctness: **True**
