Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that their sum equals \( k \), and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, it's beneficial to use numbers with more 1s in their binary representation.
   - The most straightforward way to achieve this is to set the first element to a large number with many 1s in its binary representation, and the rest to small values or zero.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` constructs the sequence `nums` as follows:
     - The first element `nums[0]` is set to \( (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 \), which is the largest number with fewer than \( k \) bits set to 1.
     - The remaining elements are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, ensuring that the sum of the sequence equals \( k \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( k \) is very small, the first element might be too large, but the remaining elements will be adjusted accordingly.
   - The approach ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s possible given the constraints.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly sets the first element to a large number with many 1s.
   - It then distributes the remaining value of \( k \) among the other elements, ensuring the sum constraint is met.
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s possible due to the initial large value of the first element.

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.
