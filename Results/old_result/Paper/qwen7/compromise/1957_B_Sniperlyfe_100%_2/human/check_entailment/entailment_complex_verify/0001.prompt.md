You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())

    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of n integers where `nums[0]` is (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, with `k` being decremented by `nums[i]` after each assignment.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where `nums[0]` is `k`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. After each assignment, `k` is decremented by `nums[i]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. Then, it sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and adjusts `k` accordingly. For each subsequent element `nums[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), it assigns the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k` to `nums[i]` and decreases `k` by the assigned value. Finally, it ensures `nums[0]` is updated to the remaining value of `k`. The function returns the list `nums`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate an array `nums` of length `n` such that the sum of elements equals `k` and the bitwise OR of all elements is maximized.
   - The function initializes `nums` with zeros.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits.
   - It subtracts this value from `k`.
   - For subsequent elements, it tries to add the smallest possible value that keeps the sum equal to `k` while maximizing the bitwise OR.
   - Finally, it adjusts the first element to ensure the sum constraint is met.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The initial value for `nums[0]` ensures that it uses the highest possible value within the bit length of `k`, which helps maximize the bitwise OR.
   - The subsequent values are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining value of `k`, ensuring that the sum constraint is maintained.
   - The final adjustment to `nums[0]` ensures that the total sum remains `k`.

### Testing the Functionality

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `1 5`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The only possible value is `5` since it is the largest number less than or equal to `5` that can be used.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `1 2`
   - Explanation: `1 | 2 = 3` and the sum is `1 + 2 = 3`. This is the optimal solution.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `2 5`
   - Expected Output: `5 0`
   - Explanation: `5 | 0 = 5` and the sum is `5 + 0 = 5`. This is the optimal solution.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `6 51`
   - Expected Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
   - Explanation: `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 37` and the sum is `3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51`. This is the optimal solution.

### Conclusion

The provided function `func_1` correctly generates the required sequence for each test case, ensuring the sum constraint and maximizing the bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.
