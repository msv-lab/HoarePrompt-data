Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `k`**: The function `func_1` attempts to set the first element of the list `nums` to a value derived from `k.bit_length() - 1`. This approach does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence will maximize the number of 1s in its binary representation. Instead, it should focus on distributing the value of `k` in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Values**: The loop that follows does not correctly distribute the remaining value of `k` among the other elements. It sets each subsequent element to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and subtracts this value from `k`, which does not guarantee the optimal distribution for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is very small compared to `n`, or when `k` is close to the maximum possible sum of `n` ones.

A more appropriate approach would involve setting some elements to the highest possible values (like powers of 2) to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR while ensuring the sum constraint is met. Here's an example of how you could implement a correct solution:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    # Initialize the result list with zeros
    nums = [0] * n
    
    # Distribute the value of k among the numbers to maximize the number of 1s in the OR
    for i in range(n):
        if k >= (1 << (n - i - 1)):
            nums[i] = (1 << (n - i - 1))
            k -= (1 << (n - i - 1))
        else:
            nums[i] = k
            break
    
    # Ensure the sum of nums equals k
    if sum(nums) != k:
        nums[-1] += (k - sum(nums))
    
    return nums
```

This solution ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized by setting the highest possible values first and then adjusting the last element if necessary to meet the sum constraint.
