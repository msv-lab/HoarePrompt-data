Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of n integers where `nums[0]` is (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, and `k` is decreased by `nums[i]` after each iteration.
