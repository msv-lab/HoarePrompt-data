Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of n integers where `nums[0]` is `k`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, with `k` being decremented by `nums[i]` after each assignment.**

Explanation: Initially, `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. However, the code snippet updates `nums[0]` to `nums[0] + k`. Given that `nums[0]` was initially set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, after adding `k`, `nums[0]` becomes `k`. All other elements of `nums` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `nums[0]`.
