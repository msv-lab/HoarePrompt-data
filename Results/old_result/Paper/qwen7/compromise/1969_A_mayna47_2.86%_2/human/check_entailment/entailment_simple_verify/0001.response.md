### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The function `func_1` should be called `t` times, once for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - In `func_1`, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `v` representing the best friends.
   - If `n == 2`, it prints `2` directly because both friends are each other's best friends and must be invited.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through each friend and checks if the friend and their best friend's best friend form a cycle of length 2 (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and can be invited together.
   - If no such pair exists, it correctly assumes that at least three friends need to be invited to ensure at least two friends come to the party.
   - The code handles the special case of `n == 2` correctly by printing `2`.
   - However, the logic for checking the cycle of length 2 is flawed. Specifically, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` does not guarantee that the two friends are each other's best friends. This condition only checks if the friend and their best friend's best friend are the same friend, which is not sufficient.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where `n == 2` correctly by printing `2`.
   - The main loop in `func_1` ensures that all friends are checked, but the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is insufficient to determine if the two friends are each other's best friends.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```
- According to the problem statement, the best friends are:
  - Friend 1 -> Friend 2
  - Friend 2 -> Friend 3
  - Friend 3 -> Friend 4
  - Friend 4 -> Friend 1

- The code would iterate through each friend and check `v[v[v[i]]]`:
  - For `i = 1`: `v[v[v[1]]] = v[v[2]] = v[3] = 4` (not equal to 1)
  - For `i = 2`: `v[v[v[2]]] = v[v[3]] = v[4] = 1` (not equal to 2)
  - For `i = 3`: `v[v[v[3]]] = v[v[4]] = v[1] = 2` (not equal to 3)
  - For `i = 4`: `v[v[v[4]]] = v[v[1]] = v[2] = 3` (not equal to 4)

- Since no pair satisfies `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, the code incorrectly prints `3`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for checking the cycle of length 2 is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
