Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to solve a specific problem where Monocarp needs to invite the minimum number of friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party based on their best friend relationships.
2. The function `func_1()` is supposed to handle each test case independently.
3. For `n == 2`, the solution directly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited as they are each other's best friends.
4. For `n > 2`, the program constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i-th` friend. It then checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends' best friends (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a pair exists, it means inviting just these two friends would suffice, and the program prints `2`.
5. If no such pair exists, the program prints `3`, indicating that at least three friends need to be invited to ensure at least two friends come to the party.

Given the logic and the provided states, the program correctly handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
