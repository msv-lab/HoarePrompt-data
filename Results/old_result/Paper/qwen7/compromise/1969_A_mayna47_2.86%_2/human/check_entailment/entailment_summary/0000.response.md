Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it initializes the list `v` with zeros and then updates it with the input list `p`.
3. The program checks if `n` is 2. If it is, it prints `2` because both friends must be invited, as their best friends are each other.
4. For `n > 2`, it checks if there exists a pair of friends `(i, v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If this condition is met, it means that inviting both `i` and `v[v[i]]` will ensure that both friends come to the party, and thus, only 2 invitations are needed. In this case, it prints `2`.
5. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the logic implemented in the program matches the requirements. The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem and provides the right output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
