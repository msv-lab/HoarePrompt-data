Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, or their properties. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged, while `v` is now a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
