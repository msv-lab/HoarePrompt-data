The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each pair of `x` and `y`, it calculates a specific output based on the values of `x` and `y`. If `space_x` (which is `x`) can fit within the remaining cells after accounting for `space_y` (which is `y * 4`), it appends the required number of screens (`screen_require_for_y`) to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed (`extra_screen`) and appends the total number of screens required to the result list. Finally, it prints a series of integers, each representing the calculated result for each test case, with each integer on a new line.
