Output State: **`current` is now the first element that was in the queue before it was dequeued, `dist` holds the shortest distance from the initial node to the `current` node, `queue` is still empty, and `visited` contains all nodes that were visited during the entire execution of the loop.**

This means that the `current` node is now set to the first node that was in the queue before being dequeued, and `dist` holds the shortest distance from the initial node to this `current` node. The `queue` remains empty, indicating no nodes are left to process. The `visited` list still contains all nodes that were visited during the loop's execution.
