Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple (start, 0), `current` is start, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and `neighbor`, and there exists a neighbor that is not in `visited`.**

The code adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set, which means that the `neighbor` is now included in the set of visited nodes. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
