Postcondition: **`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the next node and its distance, `current` is the start node, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`. The current node is not equal to the target.**
