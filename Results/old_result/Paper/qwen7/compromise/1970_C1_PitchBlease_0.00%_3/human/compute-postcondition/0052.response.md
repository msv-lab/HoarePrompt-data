Output State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the neighbor is now in `visited`, and `current` remains as the current node in the tree**.

Explanation: The code adds the `neighbor` to the set `visited`. This means that the `neighbor` which was previously not in `visited` is now added to it. All other conditions and preconditions remain unchanged.
