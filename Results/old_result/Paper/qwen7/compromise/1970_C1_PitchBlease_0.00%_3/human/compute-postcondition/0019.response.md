Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple (neighbor_last, dist + 1) and an additional tuple (next_neighbor, dist + 1), `current` is the next neighbor in the tree, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `neighbor_last`, `neighbor`, and `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code adds `neighbor` to the `visited` set. Since `neighbor` was already in the `visited` set, adding it again does not change the set. All other variables remain unchanged.
