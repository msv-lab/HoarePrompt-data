The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. The function returns 0 in two cases: either when the target node is not reachable from the start node (Case_1 and Case_2) or when the shortest distance from the start node to the current node is found (Case_3). In another case, if the target node is not a leaf (Case_4), the function returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `bfs` is to perform a breadth-first search from the `start` node to find the shortest path to the `target` node and return the distance if the target is a leaf, 0 if the target is unreachable, or -1 if the target is not a leaf.
