Output State: **`current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called; `tree[current]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor; `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set; `queue` now contains a tuple of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`).**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple containing the `neighbor` and `dist + 1` to the `queue`. Here, `dist + 1` represents the distance from the current node to the `neighbor` node. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
