Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The program either returns the shortest distance from the initial node to the current node if `current` equals `target`, or it continues without returning anything if `current` does not equal `target`.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor. If the `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `queue` will contain a new element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and the `neighbor` will be added to `visited`. If the `neighbor` is already in `visited`, then no changes are made to `queue` or `visited`, and `current` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`, and `current` is set to one such neighbor. If the `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `queue` now contains a tuple of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), and `visited` now includes the neighbor of `current`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `neighbor` is added to `visited` if it is not already in `visited`; `queue` contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` is not in `visited`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
