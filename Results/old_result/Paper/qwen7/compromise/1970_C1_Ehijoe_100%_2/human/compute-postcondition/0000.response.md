Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5; `n` is updated to the integer input value, and `t` is updated to the integer input value.**

Explanation: The code `n, t = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. Since the initial state specified that `t` is 1, this value remains unchanged unless explicitly modified by the input. The values of `u` and `v` are not affected by this input, so they remain within their initial constraints. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input value, and `t` is also updated to the integer input value.
