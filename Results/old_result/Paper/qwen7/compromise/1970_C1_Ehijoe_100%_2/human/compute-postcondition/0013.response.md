Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` is the integer input value, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `n` is the integer input value, `edges` is a list of edges entered during the loop, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key from 1 to `n` has a list of its adjacent nodes, `ends` is a list containing all keys from 1 to `n` that have exactly one adjacent node, `s` is an integer from the list `ends`, `e` is an integer from the list `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the integer `s`, `prev` is the integer `s`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = s` assigns the current value of `s` to `prev`. Since `s` is an integer from the list `ends`, `prev` now holds the same value as `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
