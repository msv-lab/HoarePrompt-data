Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` is the integer input value, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `n` is the integer input value, `edges` is a list of edges entered during the loop, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key from 1 to `n` has a list of its adjacent nodes, `ends` is a list containing all keys from 1 to `n` that have exactly one adjacent node, `s` is an integer from the list `ends`, `e` is an integer from the list `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the integer `s`, `prev` is the integer `s`, `curr` is the first adjacent node of `s`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first adjacent node of `s` to `curr`. Since `s` is an integer from the list `ends`, which contains all keys from 1 to `n` that have exactly one adjacent node, `curr` will be the only adjacent node of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
