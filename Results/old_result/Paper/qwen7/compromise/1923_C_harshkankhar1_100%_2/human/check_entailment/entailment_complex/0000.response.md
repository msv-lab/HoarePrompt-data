Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and `q` for each test case.
2. It initializes the arrays `a` and `b` appropriately.
3. The array `a` is computed using the `accumulate` function, which is correct for calculating the prefix sums of the array `a`.
4. The array `b` is constructed such that `b[i]` equals `i` if `a[i] > 1` and `2 * i` otherwise. This step is also correct.
5. For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` (calculated using `a`) is greater than or equal to the corresponding value derived from `b`. If the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` holds, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. This logic is correct based on the problem statement.
6. The program handles all the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
