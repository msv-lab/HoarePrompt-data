Output State: **`b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is equal to `i` if `a[i] > 1`, otherwise `2 * i`, and `a` is the accumulated sum of the original `a` list. The first element `b[0]` remains `0`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(accumulate(a))` modifies the list `a` to be the accumulated sum of the original `a` list. However, the description of `b` does not change because the operation performed on `a` does not affect the elements of `b`. Each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is still defined as `i` if `a[i] > 1`, otherwise `2 * i`. The first element `b[0]` remains `0`.
