Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `q`. However, since `_` is just an underscore used as a throwaway variable, it doesn't affect the loop's execution condition. The only relevant variable here is `q`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `q`**: The initial state of `q` is not specified directly in the problem statement. For the loop to execute, `q` must be at least 1 because `range(q)` will generate numbers from 0 to `q-1`, and if `q` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the only variable that affects the loop's execution is `q`, we need to ensure that `q` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `q` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
