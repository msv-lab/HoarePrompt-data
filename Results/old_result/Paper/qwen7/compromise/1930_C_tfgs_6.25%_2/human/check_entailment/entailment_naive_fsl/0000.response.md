Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the elements are inserted into the set `S` in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final array `b`.

The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in `a` after incrementing each element by its index plus one. It then converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. However, this approach does not guarantee that the lexicographically largest possible array `b` is constructed.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3
6 4 8
```

According to the problem description, the steps should be:
1. Select `i = 1`, insert `a_1 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7` into `S`, and delete `a_1` from `a`. Now `a = [4, 8]`.
2. Select `i = 2`, insert `a_2 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10` into `S`, and delete `a_2` from `a`. Now `a = [4]`.
3. Select `i = 1`, insert `a_1 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5` into `S`, and delete `a_1` from `a`. Now `a = []`.

Thus, `S = {10, 7, 5}` and sorting `S` in descending order gives `b = [10, 7, 5]`.

However, the program outputs `[11, 7, 6]`, which is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the problem description for this input, making it incorrect.
