Output State: **`cnt` is equal to `cnt - adv`, `j` is equal to `adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt -= adv` subtracts the value of `adv` from `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `cnt` is updated to `cnt - adv`, while `j` remains equal to `adv` and `ans` retains its original list of values from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2`.
