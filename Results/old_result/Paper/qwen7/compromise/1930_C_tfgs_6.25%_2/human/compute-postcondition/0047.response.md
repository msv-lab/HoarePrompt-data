Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `ans` is a list. If `i > 0`, then `cnt` is equal to `cnt - adv`, `j` is equal to `adv`, `ans` contains the values from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged.
