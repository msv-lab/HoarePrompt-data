Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is already given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` starts at 0 and will increment by 1 in each iteration.

Given these points, the initial state of `i` should be 0, and `n` should be at least 1.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so its value (which is between 1 and \(10^4\)) does not need to be adjusted.
- `a` is a list of integers, but its contents are not relevant to the loop condition.
- `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` starts at 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
