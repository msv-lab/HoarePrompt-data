Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < adv`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented from its initial value.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `adv` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` now contains `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `previous_j + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `adv`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `adv` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
- `i` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
- `ans` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to `j + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `[a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1]`**
