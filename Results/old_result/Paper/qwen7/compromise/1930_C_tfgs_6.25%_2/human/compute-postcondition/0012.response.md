Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, and `counter` is a dictionary counting the occurrences of each element in the updated list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The variables `i` and `counter` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `a` now contains its unique elements sorted from highest to lowest.
