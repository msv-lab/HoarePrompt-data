Output State: `adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains a list with the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `adv` must still be greater than 0, `i` remains as `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0, and the list `ans` will contain the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated exactly `adv` times.
