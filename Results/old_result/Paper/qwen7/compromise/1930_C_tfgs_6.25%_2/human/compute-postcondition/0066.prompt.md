Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - cnt`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, and `counter` is a dictionary counting the occurrences of each element in the updated list `a`; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - cnt - adv`, `ans` now contains the list `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]` appended with `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `cnt` is equal to `cnt - adv` if `i > 0`, `j` is equal to `adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` contains the values from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2` if `i > 0`, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1 if `i > 0`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` contains the sequence starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by `adv`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `a` and `j` remain unchanged, `ans` is appended with `a[i]`, `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
