Output State: **`cnt` is equal to `cnt - adv`, `j` is equal to `adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `counter[a[i - 1]]` by `adv`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
