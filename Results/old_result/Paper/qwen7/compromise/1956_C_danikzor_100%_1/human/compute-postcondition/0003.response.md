Output State: The output consists of `n` lines for each iteration of the loop, where each line contains three parts: 
1. A number `1` followed by `i` (where `i` ranges from `1` to `n`).
2. Then, the numbers from `n` down to `1`.

So, if `n` is any integer between 1 and 500, the output will be `n` lines, each starting with `1` followed by `i`, then the numbers from `n` down to `1`.
