Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix \(a\) using at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and prints it along with the number of operations required.
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum sum \(s\) is \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\).
   - It also prints \(2n\) operations, which are of type 1 and type 2, respectively, where each operation sets the entire row or column to a descending permutation of numbers from \(n\) to \(1\).

3. **Checking the Correctness**:
   - The formula \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\) is derived from the properties of permutations and the structure of the matrix. This formula correctly represents the maximum sum achievable when each element in the matrix is set to its maximum possible value through the allowed operations.
   - The operations performed (permuting each row and each column to descending order) ensure that every element in the matrix reaches its maximum possible value under the given constraints.
   - Since the solution uses exactly \(2n\) operations, it adheres to the requirement of using no more than \(2n\) operations.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
