Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num` and the range `range(1, n + 1)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: The loop starts with `num` set to the first value in the range, which is 1.

3. **Determine the state of `n`**: Since `num` starts at 1 and the loop will iterate up to `n`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Check the state of `count_a`**: The dictionary `count_a` is not directly involved in the loop head, but its state is important for the loop body. However, we are only concerned with adjusting the states of objects in the loop head.

5. **Check the state of `max_score`**: Similarly, `max_score` is not directly involved in the loop head, so we do not need to adjust its state.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only variables we need to adjust are `num` and `n`.

- `num` should be set to 1 (the starting value of the loop).
- `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`num` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
