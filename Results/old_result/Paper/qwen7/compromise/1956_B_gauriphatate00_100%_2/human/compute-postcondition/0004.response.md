Output State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 1 to n and the values are the counts of each integer in the list `a`, with each integer's count being at most 2; `max_score` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `max_score` to 0. This does not affect the values of `count_a`, so the initial state of `count_a` remains unchanged. Therefore, `max_score` is 0, and the dictionary `count_a` retains its original state.
