### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided function `func_1`. The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by simply counting the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand. However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy that Nene will use to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

To properly solve this problem, we need to simulate the game and consider Nene's optimal moves. Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the original assessment is correct:

1. **Objective Mismatch:**
   - The function `func_1` does not simulate the game dynamics where Nene plays optimally. It only counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand, which is not relevant to the optimal strategy.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. This means that when you play a card, Nene will respond in a way that maximizes her score and minimizes yours. The function `func_1` does not account for this dynamic interaction.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - In the first test case (`1 1 2 3`), the optimal play would be:
     1. You play 1, Nene plays 1 (you get 0 points).
     2. You play 2, Nene plays 2 (you get 0 points).
     3. You play 3, Nene plays 3 (you get 0 points).
   - Therefore, the maximum points you can get is 1 (if you play 1 before Nene).

   - In the second test case (`7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`), the optimal play would be:
     1. You play 7, Nene plays 7 (you get 0 points).
     2. You play 4, Nene plays 4 (you get 0 points).
     3. You play 1, Nene plays 1 (you get 0 points).
     4. You play 2, Nene plays 2 (you get 0 points).
     5. You play 8, Nene plays 8 (you get 1 point).
     6. You play 5, Nene plays 5 (you get 1 point).
   - Therefore, the maximum points you can get is 2.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct in identifying that the function `func_1` does not implement the optimal strategy required by the problem.
