### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by optimally choosing your moves, given that Nene will also play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integers on the cards in your hand.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the maximum score you can achieve.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `count_a` is used to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - The logic in `func_1` iterates through each integer from 1 to `n` and checks if the count of that integer in `count_a` is 2. If it is, it increments the `max_score`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Since Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the key insight is that you should try to avoid situations where Nene can pair your cards with cards on the table to score points.
   - By ensuring that you do not leave any integer with a count of 2 in your hand, you can prevent Nene from scoring points on those integers.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies integers that appear twice in your hand and counts them towards your potential score.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where an integer appears only once in your hand by not counting it towards your score.
   - The code also correctly handles the case where no integer appears twice in your hand, resulting in a score of 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_1` accurately reflects the optimal strategy for maximizing your score given Nene's optimal play.
   - The implementation correctly counts the integers that appear twice in your hand, which directly corresponds to the maximum number of points you can score.
