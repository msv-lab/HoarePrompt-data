### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` incorrectly counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, which does not reflect the optimal strategy required by the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` for each test case.
   - `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum number of points you can get.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes a dictionary `count_a` to count occurrences of each number in the list `a`.
   - It iterates over the numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if they are present in `count_a`.
   - If a number appears exactly twice in `a`, it increments `max_score` by 1.

### Issues with the Function `func_1`:

- **Objective Mismatch:** The function `func_1` does not implement the optimal strategy for maximizing your score. Instead, it simply counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand, which is not relevant to the optimal strategy.
- **Optimal Strategy:** According to the problem, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. This means that when you play a card, Nene will respond in a way that maximizes her score and minimizes yours. The function `func_1` does not account for this dynamic interaction.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 1 2 3`
  - Nene's optimal strategy would be to play cards such that you get only 1 point. The sequence might look like:
    1. You play 1, Nene plays 1 (you get 0 points).
    2. You play 2, Nene plays 2 (you get 0 points).
    3. You play 3, Nene plays 3 (you get 0 points).
  - Therefore, the maximum points you can get is 1 (if you play 1 before Nene).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`
  - Nene's optimal strategy would be to play cards such that you get only 2 points. The sequence might look like:
    1. You play 7, Nene plays 7 (you get 0 points).
    2. You play 4, Nene plays 4 (you get 0 points).
    3. You play 1, Nene plays 1 (you get 0 points).
    4. You play 2, Nene plays 2 (you get 0 points).
    5. You play 8, Nene plays 8 (you get 1 point).
    6. You play 5, Nene plays 5 (you get 1 point).
  - Therefore, the maximum points you can get is 2.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the optimal strategy required by the problem. It only counts the number of cards that appear exactly twice, which is not relevant to the optimal play scenario.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
