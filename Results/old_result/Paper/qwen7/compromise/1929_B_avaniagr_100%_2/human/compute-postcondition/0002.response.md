Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `2 * n - 1`, or `2 * n`. The specific value on each line depends on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`. If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`.
