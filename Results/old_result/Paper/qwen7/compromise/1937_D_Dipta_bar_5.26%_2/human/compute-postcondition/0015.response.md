Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed during each iteration of the loop. These numbers are calculated based on the conditions within the loop and involve manipulations of indices and cumulative sums related to the characters '>' and '<' in the string `s`. Specifically, the calculations involve adjusting values based on the positions of these characters and their cumulative sums, and printing the result of these adjustments for each character in the string `s`. The exact sequence of numbers depends on the specific content of the string `s`, the list `A`, and the lists `idx_A` and `idx_B`.
