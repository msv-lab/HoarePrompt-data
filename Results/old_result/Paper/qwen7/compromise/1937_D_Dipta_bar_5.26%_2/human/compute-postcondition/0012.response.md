Output State: **`r` is the length of `idx_B`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions of '>' characters up to that point, adjusted by the number of intermediate '>' characters and their positions, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s`, `l` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r = len(B)` assigns the length of the list `idx_B` to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
