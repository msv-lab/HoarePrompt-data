### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement depends on the direction (`<` or `>`) at each cell, and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is defined to process the string `s`.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - It calculates two arrays `A` and `B` which store the cumulative distances traveled by the pinball when it moves right and left respectively.
   - `A` array is built by iterating from left to right, and `B` array is built by iterating from right to left.
   - The logic for building these arrays seems to be correct as it accounts for the changing directions and the cumulative distances.
   - The main loop in `func_1(s)` then uses these arrays to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

4. **Main Loop Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates through each cell and uses the precomputed arrays `A` and `B` to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for computing the time taken seems to correctly handle the changing directions and the cumulative distances.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundaries of the grid.
   - The logic for handling the cumulative distances and the changing directions appears to be robust.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case and for each starting cell.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is correct. The code handles the changing directions and the cumulative distances appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
