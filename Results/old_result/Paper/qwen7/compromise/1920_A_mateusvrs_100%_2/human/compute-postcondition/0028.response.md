Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is `n - 1`, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000000)`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`, or `bx` is -1, `a` is either 2 or not 1, `x` is an input integer, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500, `r` stays as an empty list, `n` is decremented by 1, `cx` becomes a set containing `x`, `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, and `bx` is either the maximum of `x` and its previous value or -1, depending on whether `a` equals 1 or not.
