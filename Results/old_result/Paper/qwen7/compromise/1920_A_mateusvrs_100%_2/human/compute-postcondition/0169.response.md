Output State: **`tmp` is incremented by 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged, `n` is equal to the size of `cx` minus 1, `cx` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1 if the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax` is true. If the condition is false, `tmp` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `cx`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.
