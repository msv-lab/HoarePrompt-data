Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is `n - 1`, `cx` is a set containing `x` or an empty set, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000000)`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`, `a` is either 2 or not 1, `x` is an input integer, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The line `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of the current value of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
