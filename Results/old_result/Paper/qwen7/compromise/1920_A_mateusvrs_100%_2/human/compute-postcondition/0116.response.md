Output State: **All elements in `cx` have been iterated over, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range from `bx` to `ax` (inclusive).**

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `cx` contains all distinct `x` values that were processed. The variable `tmp` holds the total count of these `x` values that fall within the range defined by `bx` and `ax`.
