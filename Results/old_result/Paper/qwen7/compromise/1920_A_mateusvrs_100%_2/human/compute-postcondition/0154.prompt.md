Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `a` could be any integer from the inputs, `x` could be any integer from the inputs, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` is 1000000000
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is either 1 or -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` is either 1000000000 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 1, `bx` is 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` remains the minimum of `x` and 1000000000. Otherwise, `cx` includes `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1; `bx` is either 1 or -1; `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`; `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions; `t` is 0; `ax` is either 1000000000 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000000; `a` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `a` is not equal to 1; `a` is assigned the value of the first input integer; `x` is assigned the value of the second input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` is either 1000000000 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
