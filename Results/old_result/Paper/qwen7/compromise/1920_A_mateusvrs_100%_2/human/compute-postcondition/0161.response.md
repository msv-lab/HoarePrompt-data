Output State: **`tmp` is increased by 1, `n` must be equal to the size of `cx`, `cx` must contain at least one element, the index `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. The other conditions and constraints on the variables `n`, `cx`, `i`, `bx`, and `ax` remain unchanged.
