Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is added to the set `cx`, and `a` is not equal to 1, and `a` is not equal to 2**.

The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `x` is an input integer, it is now part of the set `cx`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
