Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on a series of constraints involving integers t, n, a, and x, where t ranges from 1 to 500, n ranges from 2 to 100, a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x ranges from 1 to 10^9. The function checks these constraints and returns a result according to the given conditions.**
