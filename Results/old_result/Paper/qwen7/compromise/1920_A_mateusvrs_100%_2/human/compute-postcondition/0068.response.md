Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` equals 1, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is equal to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

Explanation: The code updates `bx` to be the maximum value between `x` and the current value of `bx`. Since `bx` was not defined before, it is assumed to be the default minimum possible value (which is negative infinity in Python for integers). Therefore, `bx` will take the value of `x` if `x` is greater than the previous value of `bx`, or remain unchanged if `x` is less than or equal to the previous value of `bx`.
