Output State: **`cx` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `cx`; `tmp` is increased by 1.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `cx` must contain at least one element and `i` is the next element in `cx`, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `tmp` has been incremented by 1.
