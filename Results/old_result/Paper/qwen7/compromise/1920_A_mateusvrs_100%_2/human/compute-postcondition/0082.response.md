Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from the input; `x` is an integer from the input; `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

Explanation: The variable `bx` is updated to be the maximum value between `x` and its current value. Since `x` is an integer from the input, and assuming `bx` had a previous value (which could be any integer), `bx` now holds the larger of these two values. The conditions and values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
