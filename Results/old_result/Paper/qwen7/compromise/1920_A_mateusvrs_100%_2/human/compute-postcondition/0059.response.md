Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is a list containing either [0] or [ax - bx + 1 - tmp], `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, and `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
- `r` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, depending on whether `bx` is greater than `ax`.
- `n` becomes 0 because the loop runs `n` times and upon completion, `n` is effectively decremented to 0.
- `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop.
- `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2.
- `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided.
- `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`.
