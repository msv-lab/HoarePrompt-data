Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is `n - 2`, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000000)`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`, or `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500, `r` remains an empty list, `n` remains `n - 2`, `ax` remains `min(x, 1000000000)`, `bx` remains the maximum of `x` and `bx` (or -1 if `bx` was -1), and `a` and `x` remain input integers. `_` also remains 1.
