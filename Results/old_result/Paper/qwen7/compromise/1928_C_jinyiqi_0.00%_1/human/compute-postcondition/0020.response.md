The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns a list that combines the divisors of `x` in descending order with the corresponding quotients in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x`, and returns a list combining the divisors of `x` in descending order with the corresponding quotients in descending order.**
