Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is an integer, `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` is a list containing the value of `i`, `output2` is a list containing the value of `int(x / i)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(x / i)` to `output2`. Since `x` is divisible by `i`, `x / i` results in an integer, and `int(x / i)` is the integer quotient of `x` divided by `i`. The initial values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged, and `output1` remains a list containing the value of `i`. `output2` now contains the integer quotient of `x` divided by `i`.
