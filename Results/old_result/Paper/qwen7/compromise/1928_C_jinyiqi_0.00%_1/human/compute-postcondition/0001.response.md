Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `output2` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `x`, `n`, or `output1`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `output2` and retains the original values of `x`, `n`, and `output1`.
