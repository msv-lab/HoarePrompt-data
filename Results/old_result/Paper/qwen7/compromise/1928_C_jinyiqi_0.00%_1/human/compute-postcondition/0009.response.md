Output State: **`x` is an integer and divisible by `i + 1`; `i` is an integer and equals `i + 1`; `output1` is a list with the element `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `output1.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `output1`. Since `i` is initially set to `i + 1`, the value appended to `output1` is `i + 1`. The initial conditions that `x` is an integer and divisible by `i + 1` and `i` is an integer and equals `i + 1` remain valid.
