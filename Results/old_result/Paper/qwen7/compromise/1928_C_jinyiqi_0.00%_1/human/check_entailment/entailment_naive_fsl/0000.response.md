Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is greater than `n/2`. Specifically, the logic in the program assumes that the number of possible `k` values can be derived from the divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but it does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.

For example, consider the test case `(n, x) = (100, 99)`. According to the problem description, the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the value of `k` must be such that the settling fits within the range of positions. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of valid `k` values without properly considering the constraints.

In this specific case, the program will not correctly identify that there are no valid `k` values, leading to an incorrect output of `0` instead of the expected `0`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the calculated `k` values are within the valid range and correctly account for the repeating pattern of settling.
