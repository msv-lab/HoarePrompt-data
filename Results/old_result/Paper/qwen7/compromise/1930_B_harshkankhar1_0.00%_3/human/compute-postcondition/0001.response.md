Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` is a list where every second element starting from the first is reversed, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element in the list `a`, starting from the first element (index 0). This means that the elements at even indices in the list will be reversed while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
