Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, it returns information based on the values of `t` and `n`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a `t` and an `n` value, and it processes these values according to specified conditions without needing any parameters passed to it directly.
