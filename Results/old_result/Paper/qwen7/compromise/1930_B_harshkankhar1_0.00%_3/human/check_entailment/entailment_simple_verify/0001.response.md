### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy the condition that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case using `for _ in range(int(input()))`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - In `func_1()`, it creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then reverses every other element in the list `a` (i.e., elements at even indices).

3. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify if the generated permutation satisfies the given condition.
   - Consider a permutation like `[4, 1, 2, 3]` (for \( n = 4 \)). This permutation is generated by reversing every other element in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Check the condition for this permutation:
     - For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 3 \): \( p_1 = 4 \) and \( p_3 = 2 \). \( 4 \) does not divide \( 2 \), and \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \). \( 1 \) divides \( 3 \), but this does not violate the condition since \( p_2 \) and \( p_4 \) are not consecutive.
     - For other pairs, similar checks can be done, and it can be shown that no pair violates the condition.

4. **General Case**:
   - For any \( n \), the permutation generated by reversing every other element will ensure that no two consecutive elements in the original sequence (before reversal) will have the divisibility condition satisfied when considering their positions in the new permutation.

However, upon closer inspection, the original assessment overlooks a critical aspect. Specifically, the condition \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) must hold for all pairs \( (i, j) \) where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \). The provided permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` does not necessarily satisfy this condition for all possible pairs.

For instance, consider the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` again:
- For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 2 \): \( p_1 = 4 \) and \( p_2 = 1 \). \( 4 \) does not divide \( 1 \), but we need to check further.
- For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 3 \): \( p_1 = 4 \) and \( p_3 = 2 \). \( 4 \) does not divide \( 2 \).
- For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 4 \): \( p_1 = 4 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \). \( 4 \) does not divide \( 3 \).
- For \( i = 2 \) and \( j = 3 \): \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_3 = 2 \). \( 1 \) divides \( 2 \), and \( p_3 = 2 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \). \( 2 \) does not divide \( 3 \), so this does not violate the condition.

But, let's consider another pair:
- For \( i = 2 \) and \( j = 4 \): \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \). \( 1 \) divides \( 3 \), and \( p_3 = 2 \) and \( p_5 \) (which does not exist in this case) would not be considered. However, the condition must hold for all pairs, and this permutation fails for the pair \( (2, 4) \).

Thus, the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` does not satisfy the condition for all pairs, and the general case analysis is flawed because it does not guarantee that no two consecutive elements in the original sequence will satisfy the divisibility condition in the new permutation.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly generate a permutation that satisfies the problem's requirements for all test cases.
