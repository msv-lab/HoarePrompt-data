Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, `smallList` has one less element.**

Explanation: The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `smallList` must have at least one element left initially, after popping, it will have one less element. The state of `bigList` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
