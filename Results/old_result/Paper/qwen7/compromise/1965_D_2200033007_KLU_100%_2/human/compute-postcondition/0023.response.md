Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, `a[idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`, `idx` is `idx - 1`**.

This means that the value of `a[idx]` has been updated to `(x - prev) // 2`, while the lists and variables `odds`, `prev`, and `idx` retain their previous states except for the updated value of `a[idx]`.
