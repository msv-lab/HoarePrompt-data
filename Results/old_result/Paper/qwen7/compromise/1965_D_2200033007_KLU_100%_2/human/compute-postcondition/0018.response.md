Postcondition: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the current value of `x` from the previous iteration, and if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`; otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2**.
