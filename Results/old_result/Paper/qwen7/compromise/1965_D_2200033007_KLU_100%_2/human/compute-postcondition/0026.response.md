Postcondition: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, `a[idx]` is either updated to `x` or `(x - prev) // 2` depending on whether `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, and `idx` is decremented by 1.**
