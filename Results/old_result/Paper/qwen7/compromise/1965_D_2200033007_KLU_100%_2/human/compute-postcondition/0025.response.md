Postcondition: `odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, `idx` is `idx - 1`, and `a[idx]` is updated to either `x` or `(x - prev) // 2` depending on whether `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`.
