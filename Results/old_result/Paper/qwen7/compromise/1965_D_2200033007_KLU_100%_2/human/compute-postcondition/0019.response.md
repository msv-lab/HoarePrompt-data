Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the current iteration, and if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`; otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = x` updates the value of `prev` to the current value of `x`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
