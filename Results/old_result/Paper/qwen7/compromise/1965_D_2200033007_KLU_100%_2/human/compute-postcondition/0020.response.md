Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the current iteration, `idx` is decremented by 1, and if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`; otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `odds` remains a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of the palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` remains the value of `x` from the current iteration, and the conditions for updating `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` also remain the same.
