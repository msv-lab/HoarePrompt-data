Functionality: **The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case involves four lines of input representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the given points and prints the square of this difference. The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated result for each test case.**
