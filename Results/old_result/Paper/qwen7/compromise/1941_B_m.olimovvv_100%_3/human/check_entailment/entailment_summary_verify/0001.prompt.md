You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list `a` and modifies its elements based on specific conditions. If any condition is violated during the iteration, it prints 'NO' and breaks. After processing all elements, if the last two elements of the list are both zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `a-3` (since the operation requires indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`).
   - For each index `i`:
     - If `b[i]` is negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop because it's impossible to have a negative value in the array after applying the operation.
     - It then updates the subsequent elements in the array based on the operation: `b[i+1] -= b[i]*2`, `b[i+2] -= b[i]`, and `b[i] -= b[i]` (which effectively sets `b[i]` to 0).
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are non-zero. If they are, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Negative Values:**
   - The program correctly identifies if there is any negative value in the array during the iteration. If so, it immediately prints 'NO', which is correct because having a negative value means the array cannot be made all zeros with the given operations.

2. **Updating Array Elements:**
   - The operations performed (`b[i+1] -= b[i]*2`, `b[i+2] -= b[i]`) are consistent with the problem statement. However, the line `b[i] -= b[i]` is redundant since it just sets `b[i]` to 0.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check ensures that the last two elements are zero, which is necessary because the operations only affect three consecutive elements at a time. If the last two elements are non-zero, it means the array cannot be fully reduced to zeros.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. It handles edge cases such as negative values and ensures that the final state of the array meets the criteria for being all zeros.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
