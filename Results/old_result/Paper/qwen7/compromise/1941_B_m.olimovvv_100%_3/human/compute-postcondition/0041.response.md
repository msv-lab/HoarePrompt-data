Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i+2]` is decreased by the value of the current element `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the element at index `i + 2` in the list `b` by the value of the element at index `i`. This operation modifies the list `b` according to the given rule. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
