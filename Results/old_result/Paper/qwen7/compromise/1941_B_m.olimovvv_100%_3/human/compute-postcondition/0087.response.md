Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `b[i + 1]` is reduced by `2 * b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` updates the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. Given that `i` is 2, this means `b[3]` (since list indices start at 0) is updated by subtracting `2 * b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
