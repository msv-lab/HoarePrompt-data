Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, and the value of `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by the value of `b[i]`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
