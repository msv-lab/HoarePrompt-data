Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, and `i` is \(a - 3\); `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]` which results in 0 since `b[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `b[i]` is 0, so `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` simplifies to `b[i + 1] -= 0 * 2`, which means `b[i + 1]` remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
