Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is greater than 2.
   - `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i+1]` is equal to `b[i+1] - 2 * b[i]` for all `i`.
   - `i` is `a - 1`.
   - `b[i]` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `b[i]` is 0, but the value of `i` is `a - 1`. Since `a` is greater than 2, `i` is a positive integer. The value of `b[i]` being 0 does not affect the print statement, as it only prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
