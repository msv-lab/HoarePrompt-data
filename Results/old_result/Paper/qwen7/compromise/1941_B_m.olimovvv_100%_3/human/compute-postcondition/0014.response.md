Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not affect the print statement.
- `a` is greater than 2. This value also does not affect the print statement.
- `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`. This means `b` is a list with all elements initialized to 0.
- `i` is \(a - 3\). This value does not affect the print statement either.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`, so the output is **NO**.
