Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and the value of `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]`. The other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `b[i + 1]` is the new value after the subtraction.
