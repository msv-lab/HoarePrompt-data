Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(0, a - 2):
        if b[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            break
        b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
        b[i + 2] -= b[i]
        b[i] -= b[i]
    else:
        if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, and `i` is \(a - 2\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where all elements `b[i]` are 0 for all `i`.

**Natural Language Description:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, all elements in the list `b` will be zero. This is because the loop continuously modifies the elements of `b` based on the conditions provided, and once it has iterated through all possible indices without encountering a condition that breaks the loop prematurely (such as finding a negative value in `b`), it checks the final state of `b`. If the last two elements (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are both zero, it prints 'YES', indicating that the transformation process has successfully reduced all elements in `b` to zero.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(a \geq 3\) (since the loop runs for `a - 2` times, meaning it needs at least 3 elements in the list `b` to complete its iterations), `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, and after all iterations, `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both 0.

This final state is derived from the fact that the loop continues to modify the list `b` according to the given rules until either a negative number is encountered (which breaks the loop and prints 'NO'), or the loop completes its iterations and checks if the last two elements of `b` are zero (which would result in printing 'YES'). Since we know the loop executed fully up to 3 iterations, and assuming no negative numbers were encountered, the only possible outcome is that the conditions inside the `else` block are met, leading to `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` becoming 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
