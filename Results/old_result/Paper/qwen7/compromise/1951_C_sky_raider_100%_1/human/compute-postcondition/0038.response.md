Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
   - `k` is decreased by `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain greater than 0.

5. **Consider the effect of the loop body (omitted)**:
   - The loop body does not directly affect `i` or `n`, but it may affect `k` and `s`. However, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine the exact changes to `k` and `s` within the loop body. Therefore, we focus on adjusting `i` and `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
