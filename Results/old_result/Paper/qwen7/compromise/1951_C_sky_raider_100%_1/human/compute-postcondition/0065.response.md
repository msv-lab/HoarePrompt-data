Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `t` is increased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `s` is updated to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`**.

Explanation: The code updates `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. It also ensures that `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`. Additionally, `t` is increased by `s`, and `i` is set to `i_prev + 1`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and `s` is updated again to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`.
