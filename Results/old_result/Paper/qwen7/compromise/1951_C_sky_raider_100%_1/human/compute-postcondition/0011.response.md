Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + 0)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * (l[0] + 0)`, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= s` subtracts the value of `s` from `k`. Since `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, and `t` and `c` are both defined as `s * (l[0] + 0)`, their values remain unchanged. The variable `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated value of `k` is `k - s`, while all other variables retain their original values.
