Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `t` is increased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `s` is updated to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`. The other variables (`c`, `t`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
