Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code `t = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `t`. The initial value of `t` was an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but now it is explicitly set to 0. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
