Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`
   - `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`
   - `t` is increased by `s`
   - `k` is decreased by `s`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (`i` is `i_prev + 1`), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i_prev + 1] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `t` is increased by `s`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**
