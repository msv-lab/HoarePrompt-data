Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is 0, `s` is 0, `c` is the sum of `c + s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `n` is an input integer, `m` and `k` are integers split from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value 0. This directly updates the value of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
