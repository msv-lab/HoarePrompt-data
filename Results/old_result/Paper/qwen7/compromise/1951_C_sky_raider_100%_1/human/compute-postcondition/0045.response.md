Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is increased by `s * (l[2] + t)`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Here, `i` is 2, so `l[i]` is `l[2]`. The value of `s` remains the same as it is the minimum value between `m` and `k`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`) are not affected by this operation.
