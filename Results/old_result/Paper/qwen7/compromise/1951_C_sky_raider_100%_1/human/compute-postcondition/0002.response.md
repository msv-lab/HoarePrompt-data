Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input as a string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are obtained from the input and stored in the list `l`.
