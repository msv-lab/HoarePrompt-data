Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * (l[0] + t)`, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 0 and `t` is 0, `c` is now `s * (l[0] + 0)`, which simplifies to `s * l[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
