Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic used in the `if` statement is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if m < a or m < b:` does not accurately reflect the conditions under which the maximum number of fireworks can be seen.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the time intervals when fireworks from both installations coincide. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate LCM of a and b
        l = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation within the visibility period
        fireworks_a = (m + 1) // a
        fireworks_b = (m + 1) // b
        # Calculate the number of simultaneous fireworks
        simultaneous_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - (m + 1) // l
        print(simultaneous_fireworks)

func()
```

This solution uses the LCM to determine the overlap and correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
