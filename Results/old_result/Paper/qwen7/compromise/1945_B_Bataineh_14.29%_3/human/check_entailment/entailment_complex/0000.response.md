Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously given the intervals at which the two installations launch fireworks and the duration each firework is visible.
2. The annotated program correctly handles the input and processes each test case as required.
3. The logic in the program checks if \(m < a\) or \(m < b\). If true, it prints 2, which is correct because in this case, no two fireworks from different installations can overlap since their visibility periods do not align within the given \(m\).
4. If \(m \geq \max(a, b)\), the program calculates the number of simultaneous fireworks using the formula \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\). This formula accounts for the fact that each installation can have its own sequence of fireworks visible at any given time, plus the additional 2 fireworks from each installation at the exact moment they align.
5. The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Given the analysis, the provided solution matches the problem statement and handles all scenarios appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
