Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either 2 or a value calculated from the expression `m // a + m // b + 2`, depending on the input values for `a`, `b`, and `m` provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. Each line corresponds to one of the `t` iterations of the loop.
