You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, so `t` is now 0. The variable `n` must be greater than 0, and `x` remains unchanged from its initial state. The variable `line` remains as the input string from the last iteration, and `T` remains as the list of integers obtained from splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer. The list `a` is a reversed list starting with the value 1000 followed by `n-1` elements, each being the difference between the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`. The variable `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` converted to strings with a space as the separator.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `n` is some positive integer, `x` is unchanged, `line` is the input from the last iteration, `T` is the list of integers from the last input, `a` is the reversed list calculated from `T`, and `result` is the space-separated string of the elements in `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a reversed list `a` starting with 1000, where each subsequent element is the difference between the previous element and the corresponding element in `x`. It then prints a space-separated string of the elements in `a`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate the array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to generate `a` is flawed. Let's consider the following case:

For the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The expected output is `[3, 5, 4, 9]`, but the program generates an incorrect sequence. Here's why:

1. The program initializes `a` with `[1000]`.
2. For the second element, it calculates `a[1] = a[0] - T[0] = 1000 - 2 = 998`.
3. For the third element, it calculates `a[2] = a[1] - T[1] = 998 - 4 = 994`.
4. For the fourth element, it calculates `a[3] = a[2] - T[2] = 994 - 1 = 993`.

This results in `a = [1000, 998, 994, 993]`, which does not satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`. For instance, `4 \neq 998 \bmod 1000`, `1 \neq 994 \bmod 998`, etc.

A correct approach would involve ensuring that each `a_i` is chosen such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
