The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a reversed list `a` starting with 1000, where each subsequent element is the difference between the previous element and the corresponding element in `x`. It then prints a space-separated string of the elements in `a`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.
