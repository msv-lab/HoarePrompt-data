Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list where the first element is 1000, followed by `n-1` elements where each element is 1000 minus the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements in the original list `a`, and the list `a` is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Since the original list `a` started with 1000 followed by `n-1` elements each calculated as `1000 - sum of the first i elements in T`, after reversing, the last element of the original list will become the first element of the new list, and so on. However, the values of the elements themselves do not change due to the reversal operation. Therefore, the output state remains as described above.
