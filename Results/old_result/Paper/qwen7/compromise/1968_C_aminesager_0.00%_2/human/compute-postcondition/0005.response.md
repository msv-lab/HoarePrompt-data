Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` remains unchanged from its initial state, `line` is a string containing a line of input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

In this output state, the variable `T` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the input line, while the other variables retain their initial or described states.
