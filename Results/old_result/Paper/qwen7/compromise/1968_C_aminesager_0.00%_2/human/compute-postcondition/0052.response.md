Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `t` is 0.
2. `n` must be greater than 0.
3. `line` remains as the input string.
4. `T` remains as the list of integers obtained from splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
5. `a` is a list starting with the value 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each being the difference between the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`.

Given these details, let's assume a specific example for `n` and `line` to illustrate the process. Let's say `n = 3` and `line = "10 20 30"`. This means:

- `T` would be `[10, 20, 30]`.
- `a` would start with 1000, and then each subsequent element is the difference between the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`.

So, `a` would be:
- First element: 1000
- Second element: 1000 - 10 = 990
- Third element: 990 - 20 = 970
- Fourth element: 970 - 30 = 940

Thus, `a` would be `[1000, 990, 970, 940]`.

Reversing `a` gives us `[940, 970, 990, 1000]`.

The `result` is obtained by joining the elements of this list into a single string separated by spaces, which results in `"940 970 990 1000"`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **940 970 990 1000**
