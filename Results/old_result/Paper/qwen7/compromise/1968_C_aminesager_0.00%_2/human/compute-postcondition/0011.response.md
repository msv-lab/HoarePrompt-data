Output State: **`a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends to list `a` the value of `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`. This means the last element of `a` is updated to this new value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` still holds true.
