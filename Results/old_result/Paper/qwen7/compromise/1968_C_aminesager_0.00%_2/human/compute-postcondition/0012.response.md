Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` was updated such that its last element is now the value of `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

4. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was previously `i`, it is now `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes `i + 1` (let's call this new value `i_new`).
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i_new`, which is `i + 1`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
