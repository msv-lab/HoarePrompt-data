Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list starting from 1000 down to 1.
- `result` is a string that contains the space-separated elements of the list `a`.

Given these details, `result` is constructed as a string with the numbers from 1000 down to 1 separated by spaces. Therefore, the value of `result` is:

"1000 999 998 ... 2 1"

Output: **1000 999 998 ... 2 1**
