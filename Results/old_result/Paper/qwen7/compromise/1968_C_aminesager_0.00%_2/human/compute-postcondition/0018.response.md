Based on the initial state described:

- The list `a` is joined into a string with each element separated by a space.
- `i` is equal to `n`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement. 

Since `a` is a list, let's assume it contains some elements, say `a = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`. When this list is joined into a string with each element separated by a space, it results in the string `'apple banana cherry'`.

However, the variable `result` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Given the context, we can infer that `result` is the string obtained by joining the list `a` with spaces. Since no specific value for `result` is provided, we can assume it is the string obtained from joining `a`.

Therefore, the `print(result)` statement will print the string obtained by joining the list `a` with spaces.

Output: **'apple banana cherry' (assuming a = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])**
