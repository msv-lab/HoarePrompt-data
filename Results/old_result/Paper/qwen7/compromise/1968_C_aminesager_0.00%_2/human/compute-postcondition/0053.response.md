Output State: The loop has finished all its iterations, so `t` is 0. The value of `n` is the same as it was after the last iteration, and it must be greater than 0. The variable `line` remains as the input string from the last iteration, and `T` remains as the list of integers obtained from splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer. The list `a` is a reversed list starting with the value 1000 followed by `n-1` elements, each being the difference between the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`. The variable `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` converted to strings with a space as the separator.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the number of elements processed in the last input, `line` and `T` are as they were in the last iteration, `a` is the reversed list calculated from `T`, and `result` is the space-separated string representation of `a`.
