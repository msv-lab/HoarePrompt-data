Output State: **`a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.**

This means that the list `a` has had its last element modified to be the result of subtracting the value at index `i-1` in the list `T` from the value at index `i-1` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
