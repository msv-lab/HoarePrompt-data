Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, so `t` is now 0. The variable `n` must be greater than 0, and `x` remains unchanged from its initial state. The variable `line` remains as the input string from the last iteration, and `T` remains as the list of integers obtained from splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer. The list `a` is a reversed list starting with the value 1000 followed by `n-1` elements, each being the difference between the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`. The variable `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` converted to strings with a space as the separator.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `n` is some positive integer, `x` is unchanged, `line` is the input from the last iteration, `T` is the list of integers from the last input, `a` is the reversed list calculated from `T`, and `result` is the space-separated string of the elements in `a`.
