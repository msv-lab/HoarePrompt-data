Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` is `[a[0] - T[0], a[0] - T[0] - T[1]]`

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the value of `i` to 3 and ensure that `n` is greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
