Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` remains unchanged from its initial state.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` and `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, `n` is now an integer input by the user, and `x` retains its initial value.
