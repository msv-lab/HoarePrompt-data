### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This function is used to read input lines in other functions.

2. **Function `func_2`**: Processes multiple test cases. It reads an integer from `func_1()` and returns it. This function likely handles the number of test cases `t`.

3. **Function `func_3`**: Converts the output of `func_1()` into a list of integers. This function is used to parse the input for each test case.

4. **Function `func_4`**: Implements the logic to simulate the ball throwing game. It correctly initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`. For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on the direction (`0`, `1`, or `?`). If the direction is `?`, both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities are considered. After processing all throws, it adjusts the set by removing `0` and adding `n` if necessary. Finally, it prints the size of the set and the elements in sorted order.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the function `func_4` correctly simulates the ball throwing game according to the rules provided. It handles all possible directions and updates the set of possible players with the ball accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct because all functions work together to simulate the ball throwing game as described in the problem statement.
