Output State: **`r` is an integer value converted from the first element returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second element returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `temp`. This does not affect the values of `r` and `c`, which remain as the first and second elements returned by `func_1().split()`, respectively. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `r` and `c`, along with the newly created empty set `temp`.
