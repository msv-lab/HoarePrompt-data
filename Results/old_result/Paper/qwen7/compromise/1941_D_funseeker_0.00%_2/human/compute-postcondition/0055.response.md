Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the added value `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The values of `r`, `c`, `q`, and `temp` remain unchanged from their initial states except that `temp` now includes the new value `(q - r) % n`.
