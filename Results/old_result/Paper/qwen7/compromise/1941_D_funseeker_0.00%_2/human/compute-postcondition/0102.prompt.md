You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. For each throw, r is an integer representing the distance of the throw (1 ≤ r ≤ n - 1), and c is a string representing the direction of the throw ('0', '1', or '?').
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `ans` contains all possible unique `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` values for all initial elements in `ans` after `m` iterations, `c` is either '1' or '?', and `m` is 0.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` now contains all possible unique `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` values for all initial elements in `ans` after `m` iterations, `c` is either '1' or '?', and `m` is 0; `ans` does not contain the value `0`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the initial length of ans without containing the value 0)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: the elements of ans (as they are initially, without containing 0)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, m, x, and ans. n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. For each throw, r is an integer representing the distance of the throw (1 ≤ r ≤ n - 1), and c is a string representing the direction of the throw ('0', '1', or '?'). The function updates the set ans based on the direction of each throw and returns the final set ans.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
