Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the added value `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `q` is the next element in `ans`, `r` is an integer value from `func_1()`, and `c` remains unchanged, these values are kept as they are. The only change is that `temp` now includes the computed value `(q + r) % n`.
