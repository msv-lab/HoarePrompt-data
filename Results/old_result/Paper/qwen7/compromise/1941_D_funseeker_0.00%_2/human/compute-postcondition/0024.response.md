Output State: **`c` remains the same, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n`, and `temp` now includes the value `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` previously contained the value `(q + r) % n`, after executing this line, `temp` will now include both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
