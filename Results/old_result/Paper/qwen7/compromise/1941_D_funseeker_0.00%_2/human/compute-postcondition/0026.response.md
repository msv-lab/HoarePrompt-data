Postcondition: `c` remains the same, `q` is the next element in `ans`, and `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n`, whether `c` is '1' or '?'.

This means that regardless of whether `c` is '1' or '?', the final state of `c`, `q`, and `temp` will be such that `temp` holds the value `(q - r) % n`, while `c` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
