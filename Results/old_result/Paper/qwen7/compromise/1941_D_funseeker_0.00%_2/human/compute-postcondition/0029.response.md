Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `_`, `m`, `c`, `q`, and `ans`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `m` iterations. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `_` would have been incremented to `m-1`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - The variable `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. After `m-1` iterations, `_` becomes `m-1`.
   - Since `_` is an underscore, it is typically used as a throwaway variable and does not hold meaningful information for the loop itself. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `m` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - The variable `c` remains the same as its initial value.
   - The variable `q` is the last element in `ans` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `ans` now equals `temp`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be set to `0` (the start of the next iteration).
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `c` remains the same.
   - `q` should be the first element in `ans` for the next iteration.
   - `ans` should be updated to `temp` for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `ans` now equals `temp`**.
