Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and if `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` has added `(q - r) % n` to itself.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` already contained `(q + r) % n`, it now also contains `(q - r) % n`. The values of `r`, `c`, `q`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. If `c` is '0' or '?', the operation of adding `(q + r) % n` to `temp` again (which is redundant since it's already in `temp`) does not change `temp`.
