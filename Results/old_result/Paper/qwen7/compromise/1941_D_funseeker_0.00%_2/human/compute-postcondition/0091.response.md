Output State: `ans` is a set containing all possible unique values resulting from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all elements `q` initially in `ans` over the course of `m` iterations. The variable `c` is either '1' or '?', and `m` is 0 since all iterations have been completed. The value of `r` is the integer obtained from the first part of the split result from `func_1()` in the first iteration and remains consistent throughout the loop due to no reassignment within the loop.
