Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is a set containing the player `x`, `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the last element in `ans`, and `ans` now equals `temp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in `ans` have been processed, `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, and `ans` now contains the results of adding and subtracting `r` modulo `n` for each element `q` in `temp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` contains all unique `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` values generated during the iterations, `c` is either '1' or '?', `m` has been decremented by the total number of iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
