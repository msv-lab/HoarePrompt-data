Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and `temp` has added `(q + r) % n` to itself.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` initially contained both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, after adding `(q + r) % n` again, `temp` still contains these two elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
