Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. It reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` for each test case, converts them to integers, and adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.

2. **Reading Permutation and Array**: The program correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` for each test case.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial scores `sp` and `bp` for Sasha and Bodya, respectively.
   - It then enters a loop that simulates `k` turns. In each turn, it updates the positions `b` and `s` to their respective new positions (`p[b]` and `p[s]`) and recalculates the scores.
   - The scores are updated using the formulae `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, and the maximum scores are stored in `bm` and `sm`.

4. **Final Comparison**:
   - After the loop, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - If `sm` is greater than `bm`, it prints 'Sasha'.
   - If they are equal, it prints 'Draw'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the game ends after fewer than `k` turns due to reaching a fixed point in the permutation (i.e., `p[p[...p[b]...-1]-1]` or `p[p[...p[s]...-1]` becomes the same as the starting position).
   - The program correctly accounts for the possibility of the game ending early by checking if `k` reaches zero before completing `k` turns.

Given the above reasoning, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
