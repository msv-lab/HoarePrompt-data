Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` by assigning it the value of `p[s] - 1`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated states are as mentioned above.
