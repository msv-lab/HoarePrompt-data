Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `b` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `bp` is updated to `a[b]`, `bm` is updated to `a[b] * k`**.

Explanation:
- `bm` is updated to `a[b] * k`. Since `b` is `p[b] - 2` and `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, the value of `bp` is already updated. Therefore, `bm` is set to `a[b] * k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
