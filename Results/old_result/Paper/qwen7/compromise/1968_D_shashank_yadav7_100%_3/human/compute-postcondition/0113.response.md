Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `b` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `b -= 1` decreases the value of `b` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
