Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `k` is `k - 1`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` must be less than `n`.
- The code `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged from its adjusted state (`i = n - 1`), as no operation directly affects `i` in this line of code.
- Therefore, `i` is `n - 1` and `k` is `k - 1`.
