Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, `b` is `b - 1`, and `s` are integers inputted from the user, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `b - 1`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
