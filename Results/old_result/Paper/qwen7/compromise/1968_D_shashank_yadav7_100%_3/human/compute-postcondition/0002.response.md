Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers inputted from the user.**

The code splits the input into four integers and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Since the specific values of the input integers are not provided, they are left as `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
