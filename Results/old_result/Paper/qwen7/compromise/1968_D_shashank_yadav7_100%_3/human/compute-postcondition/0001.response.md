State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.
2. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. Initially, before the loop starts, `i` is 0 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 (or 1 if considering the first iteration). However, since the problem specifies adjusting the state for the loop to execute and typically `i` starts at 0, we can consider `i` to be 1 for the first iteration.

Hence, the final state is: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.
