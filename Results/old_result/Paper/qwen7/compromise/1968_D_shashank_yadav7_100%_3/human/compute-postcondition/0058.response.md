Output State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[...p[b]...-1]-1] - (n-1)`, `s` is `p[p[...p[s]...-1] - (n-2)`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
