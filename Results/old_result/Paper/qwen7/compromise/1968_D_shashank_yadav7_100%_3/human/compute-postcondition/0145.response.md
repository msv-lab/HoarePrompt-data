Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `k` is `k - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
