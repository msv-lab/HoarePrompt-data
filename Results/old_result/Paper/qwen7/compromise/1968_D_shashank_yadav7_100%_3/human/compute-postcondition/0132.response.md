Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0**

The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify what `k` is, we assume `k` was equal to `i` which is 0 initially. After executing `k -= 1`, `k` (or `i`) becomes -1. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
