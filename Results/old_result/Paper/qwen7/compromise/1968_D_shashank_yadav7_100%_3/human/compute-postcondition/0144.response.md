Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `k` is `k - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `k`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
