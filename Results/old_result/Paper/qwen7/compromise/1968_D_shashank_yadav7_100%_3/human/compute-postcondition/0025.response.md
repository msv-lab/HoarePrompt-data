Output State: **`i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within, but since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
