Output State: **`i` is 1; `k` is decreased by 1**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `k` is decreased by 1, but since the initial value of `k` is not specified, we only know that `k` has been decreased by 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid.
