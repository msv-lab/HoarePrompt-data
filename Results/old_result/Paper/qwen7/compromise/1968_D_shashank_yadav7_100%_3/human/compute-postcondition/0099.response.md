Output State: **k is -2, i is 0, bm is the maximum value between bm and a[b] * -2 + bp, sm is the maximum value between sm and a[s] * -2 + sp, sp is increased by a[s] + a[s], bp is increased by a[b] + a[b], b is p[b] - 2, s is p[s] - 2, sp is increased by a[s] + a[s], bm is updated to the maximum value between bm and a[b] * -2 + bp, sm is updated to the maximum value between sm and a[s] * -2 + sp, bp is increased by a[b].**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `0` because the loop decrements `i` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variable `k` will be `-2` as it starts from `0` and gets decremented by `1` in each iteration. The values of `bm` and `sm` will be updated based on the maximum values calculated during each iteration. The variable `sp` will be increased by `a[s]` twice (once for each iteration), and `bp` will be increased by `a[b]` twice. Additionally, `b` and `s` will be updated by decrementing them according to the loop's operations, resulting in `b` being `p[b] - 2` and `s` being `p[s] - 2`.
