The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an array of integers. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n`, then reads `n` integers from the input, sorts them, converts each integer to a string, and prints them space-separated on a new line. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the output consisting of sorted arrays from each test case, each on a new line and integers within each array as strings.
