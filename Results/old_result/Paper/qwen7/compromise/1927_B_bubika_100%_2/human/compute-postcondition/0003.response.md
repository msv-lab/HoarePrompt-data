Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` and `b` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is specifically the integer input provided by the user.
