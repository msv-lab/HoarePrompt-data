### Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func()` is designed to convert a series of times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
3. **Hour Conversion Logic**: The function uses a series of `elif` statements to convert the hour part from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determine whether it is AM or PM. This logic is indeed repetitive and can be simplified.
4. **Simplification Possibility**: While the current implementation is inefficient, it does correctly handle the conversion and determination of AM/PM. The logic can be simplified using arithmetic operations, but the current implementation still works correctly.
5. **Output Format**: The function prints the converted time in the correct format "h1 : m AM/PM".

Despite the inefficiency and redundancy in the code, the function does perform the required task accurately. The provided logic, although not optimal, correctly handles all possible inputs within the specified constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation for all valid inputs. The original assessment was overly critical regarding the efficiency and simplicity of the code, but did not address the correctness of the logic itself.
