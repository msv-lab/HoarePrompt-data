Functionality: **The function processes a series of times in the 24-hour format and converts them into the corresponding 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It reads the number of test cases and for each case, it takes a time string in the format "hh:mm", converts the hour part to the 12-hour format, and prints the time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The function does not return any value but outputs the converted times.**
