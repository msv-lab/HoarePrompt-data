Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The value of `h1` is derived from the input `h` based on whether `h` is in the range 00-12 or 13-23. If `h` is 00-12, `h1` remains the same with 'AM' or 'PM' appended accordingly. If `h` is 13-23, `h1` is adjusted to reflect the correct hour in the 12-hour format with 'PM' appended. The value of `m` remains unchanged and is always a valid minute from 00 to 59.
