Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
   - This means `i` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `n`.

3. **Understand the Final State Requirements**:
   - After the loop completes all iterations, `i` should equal `n`.
   - `a` should be an empty list.
   - `last` should contain the last indices of all unique elements from the original list `a`.
   - `left` should be a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `a` up to that point in the iteration.

4. **Adjust the Initial State**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments to `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 initially.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is set such that the loop runs until `i` equals `n`.

Given these points, the initial state before the loop should be:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the length of the original list `a`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the original list `a`**.
