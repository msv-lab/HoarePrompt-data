Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` equals `n`, `a` is an empty list, `last` is a list where each element represents the last occurrence index of each unique element from the original list `a`, and `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` up to that point in the iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the original list `a`, which is `n`. The list `a` will be empty because it was being modified within the loop and emptied out. The `last` list will contain the last indices of all unique elements from the original list `a`. The `left` list will be a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `a` up to each point in the iteration.
