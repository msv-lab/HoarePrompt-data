Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` containing `n` integers (where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list. It returns `ans`, which is likely related to the processing of list `a`, such as the last occurrence index of each unique element or the cumulative sums stored in `left`.**
