Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is left[3] - a[3] - 1, `inx` is the return value of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is the last element of the list at index `i - 1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `last[i - 1]` to `inx2`. Given that `i` is 3, `inx2` becomes `last[2]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, and `inx`) remain unchanged from their initial or calculated states.
