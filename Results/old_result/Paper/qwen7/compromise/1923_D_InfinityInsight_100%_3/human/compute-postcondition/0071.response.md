Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the last element of the list at index `i - 1`, `x` is updated to `left[3] - a[3] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. Given that `i` is 4, `x` is now `left[3] - a[3] - 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `inx`, and `ans[i]` remain unchanged as per the initial state and the condition provided.
