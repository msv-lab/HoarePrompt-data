Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the last element of the list at index `i - 1`, `ans[i]` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
