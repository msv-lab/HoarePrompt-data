Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans[1]` is 1, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `left[i] - a[i] - 1` to `x`. Since `i` is initially 1, `x` becomes `left[1] - a[1] - 1`. The values of `ans[1]` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `if a[i] < a[i - 1]: continue` does not apply because `i` is 1, and there is no `a[0]` to compare with `a[1]`. Therefore, the loop continues to the next iteration, but the current state of the variables is as described.
