Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty list, `last` is an appropriately initialized list, `left` is a list with its last element updated to `left[-1] + 1`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `left[-1] + i` to the list `left`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the new value appended to `left` is `left[-1] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
