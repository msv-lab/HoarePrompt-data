You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

    return inx
    #The program returns the index of the first slime in list 'a' that is greater than or equal to 'x'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers and an integer `x`. It searches for the smallest index in the list `a` where the value is greater than or equal to `x`. If such an index exists, it returns the index (0-based). If no such index exists, it returns -1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The variable n represents the number of slimes, and a_i represents the size of the i-th slime.

    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the original list `a`, `a` itself will be an empty list, `last` will contain the last indices of all unique elements from the original list, and `left` will be a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.

    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet. However, based on the initial state, it is likely that `ans` could be related to the processing of list `a`, such as the last occurrence index of each unique element or the cumulative sums stored in `left`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` containing `n` integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5) and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list. It constructs two auxiliary lists: `last`, which stores the last occurrence index of each unique element in `a`, and `left`, which contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`. Finally, it computes a result list `ans` based on certain conditions involving these auxiliary lists. The function returns `ans`, which likely indicates the number of operations needed to transform each element in `a` into the smallest possible value through specific operations defined by the conditions.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
   - A slime can only eat a neighbor if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - If no slime can eat any other slime, the process stops.

2. **Given Code Overview:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that uses binary search to find the position where an element would fit in a sorted list.
   - `func_2` is the main function that calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function performs a binary search to find the position where `x` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is found in the list, it returns the index plus one.
   - Otherwise, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Initializes some lists: `left`, `last`, and `ans`.
   - `left` stores cumulative sums of the sizes of slimes.
   - `last` stores the last occurrence of each unique size.
   - Iterates through the slimes to populate `ans`:
     - For each slime, checks if it can eat the previous slime.
     - Uses `func_1` to find the position where the current slime's size minus one would fit in the cumulative sum list.
     - Adjusts the position using the `last` list to ensure it points to the correct previous slime.
     - Updates `ans` with the calculated time.

### Correctness Check

1. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The cumulative sum list (`left`) is correctly initialized and updated.

2. **Finding Previous Slime:**
   - The logic to find the previous slime that can be eaten is not entirely correct. The code assumes that the previous slime can always be found by simply subtracting the current slime's size from the cumulative sum, which may not be accurate due to the dynamic nature of the problem.

3. **Handling Impossible Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where a slime cannot be eaten at all. It should check if the cumulative sum is less than the current slime's size before proceeding.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases like multiple consecutive slimes of the same size correctly. The `last` list might not be updated properly in such cases.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given code does not correctly solve the problem as intended. It fails to handle various edge cases and does not accurately determine the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
