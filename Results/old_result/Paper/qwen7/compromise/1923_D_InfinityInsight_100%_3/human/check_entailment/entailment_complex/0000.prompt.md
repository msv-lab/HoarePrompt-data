Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and x is a non-negative integer representing a target size.
def func_1(a, x):
    if (x < 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: a is a list of positive integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and x is a non-negative integer representing a target size, and x is greater than or equal to 0

        #The program returns inx + 1, where inx is the index of the first slime in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`
    #State: `a` is a list of positive integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `x` is a non-negative integer representing a target size, and `inx` is the index of the first slime in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. The slime at index `inx` is strictly greater than `x`.
    return inx
    #The program returns the index of the first slime in list 'a' that is greater than or equal to 'x'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers and an integer `x`. It searches for the smallest index in the list `a` where the value is greater than or equal to `x`. If such an index exists, it returns the index (0-based). If no such index exists, it returns -1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The variable n represents the number of slimes, and a_i represents the size of the i-th slime.

        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list where each element represents the index of the last occurrence of each unique element in the list `a` up to that point.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `n`, `a` is an empty list, `last` is an appropriately initialized list with each element representing the index of the last occurrence of each unique element in the original list `a`, and `left` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that point in the iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the original list `a`, `a` itself will be an empty list, `last` will contain the last indices of all unique elements from the original list, and `left` will be a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` equals `n`, `a` is an empty list, `last` is a list where each element represents the last occurrence index of each unique element from the original list `a`, and `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` up to that point in the iteration.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet. However, based on the initial state, it is likely that `ans` could be related to the processing of list `a`, such as the last occurrence index of each unique element or the cumulative sums stored in `left`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` containing `n` integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5) and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list. It constructs two auxiliary lists: `last`, which stores the last occurrence index of each unique element in `a`, and `left`, which contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`. Finally, it computes a result list `ans` based on certain conditions involving these auxiliary lists. The function returns `ans`, which likely indicates the number of operations needed to transform each element in `a` into the smallest possible value through specific operations defined by the conditions.
