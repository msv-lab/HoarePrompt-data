Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum difference \(D\) is flawed. The program attempts to match elements from `a` and `b` but does not ensure that the maximum possible differences are always achieved. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4 6
6 1 2 4
3 5 1 7 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
16
```

However, the program outputs:
```
10
```

This happens because the program does not always select the optimal elements from `b` to maximize the differences. For instance, in the given example, the program might not consider the best possible pairings to achieve the maximum difference. A correct approach would involve sorting both arrays and pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `b`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, to ensure the maximum possible differences are achieved.
