Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `i` is set to 1 and `temp` is set to 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `temp` remain unchanged.
