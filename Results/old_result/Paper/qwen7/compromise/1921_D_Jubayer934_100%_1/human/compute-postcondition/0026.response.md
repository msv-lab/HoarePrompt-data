Output State: The loop will have executed `n` times. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. Since the loop appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans` on each iteration, `ans` will contain the absolute differences for all pairs `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `temp` will retain its last assigned value, which is `i` after the loop completes, meaning `temp` will be equal to `n - 1`. The lists `a` and `b` will remain unchanged as no modifications are made to them within the loop.

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `temp` is `n - 1`.
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n-1`.
