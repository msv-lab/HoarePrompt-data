Output State: **`ans` is updated with the value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans`. It does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `temp`, or `n`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state's conditions regarding these variables remain valid except for the update to `ans` and the increment of `i`.
