Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is -1, `temp` is -1, and `n` and `m` are integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The line `temp = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `temp`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
