Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is -1, `temp` is -1, and `ans` is an empty list, `b` is now a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from the combined list of `a` and `b` in descending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `i` is set to 1 and `temp` is set to 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `temp` remain unchanged; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
