Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `temp` is either `-1` or its final value determined during the loop, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`.**

In this final state, the loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, `a` contains the first `n` integers from the user input, sorted in ascending order, and `b` contains the `m` largest integers from the user input, sorted in descending order. The variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop processes all elements in `a`. The variable `temp` will either remain `-1` (if the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was never met) or it will hold the index `i` where the condition was first met, indicating the point where the loop's logic changed the appending behavior of `ans`. The list `ans` will contain the sum of absolute differences calculated for each pair of elements from `a` and `b` as per the described logic.
