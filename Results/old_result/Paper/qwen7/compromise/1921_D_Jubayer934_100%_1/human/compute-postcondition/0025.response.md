Output State: The loop will iterate exactly `n` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `temp` will still be `-1` since it was never assigned a value inside the loop, `ans` will be a list containing the absolute differences between each element in list `a` and the corresponding element in list `b` (from the beginning of `a` to the end of `a`).

In more detail, `ans` will contain `n` elements, each being the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `temp` remains `-1` as no `break` statement was encountered to change its value.
