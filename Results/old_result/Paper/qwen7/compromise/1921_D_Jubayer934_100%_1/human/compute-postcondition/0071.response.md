Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, `temp` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` up to the point where the condition in the loop was no longer met.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` has been incremented until it reaches `n-1`, at which point the condition `(temp != -1)` becomes false and the loop terminates. The variable `temp` is set to `-1` to indicate that the loop condition is no longer satisfied. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The list `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` for all valid indices, as per the loop's logic.
