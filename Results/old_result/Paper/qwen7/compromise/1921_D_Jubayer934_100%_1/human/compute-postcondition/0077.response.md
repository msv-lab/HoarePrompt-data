Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is -1, `temp` is -1, and `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
