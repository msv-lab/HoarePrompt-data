Output State: `temp` must be less than `n - 1`, `i` equals `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `temp` will still be less than `n - 1` (since the loop condition `i < temp` will no longer be satisfied when `i` reaches `n`). The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. The list `ans` will contain all the computed absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for each index from `0` to `n-1`.
