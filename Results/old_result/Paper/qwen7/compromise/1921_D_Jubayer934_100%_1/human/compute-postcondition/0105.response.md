Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `temp` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n-2`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`
   - `temp` must be less than or equal to `n-1`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-2`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not something that changes within the loop itself.
   - `ans` and `temp` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains the same.
   - `temp` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`, `temp` must be less than or equal to `n-1`**
