Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.

3. **Understand how the loop will change these variables**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the increment, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` (which is now 1) must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The state of `ans` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.**
