Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of both lists, `temp` is equal to `i`, `ans` is a list that has appended the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
