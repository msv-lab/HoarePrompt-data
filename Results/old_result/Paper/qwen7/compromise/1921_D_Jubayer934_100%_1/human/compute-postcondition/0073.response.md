Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers. For example, if `n = 5`, then `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order. For example, if `m = 3`, and the user inputs `[9, 8, 7]`, then `b = [9, 8, 7]`.
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `temp` is `n - 1`. If `n = 5`, then `temp = 4`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` up to the point where the condition in the loop was no longer met.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum(ans))
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the contents of `ans`.

- Since `i` is `-1`, the loop condition `i < temp` will not be met initially, and thus `ans` will be an empty list because the loop does not run.
- Therefore, `ans = []`.

When we take the sum of an empty list, the result is `0`.

So, the output of the `print(sum(ans))` statement will be:

Output: **0**
