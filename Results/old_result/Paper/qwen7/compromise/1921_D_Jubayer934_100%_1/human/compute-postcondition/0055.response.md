Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, the code calculates `abs(a[n-1] - b[n-1])` and adds it to `ans`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `temp`, and the structure of `ans` (containing the calculated difference) are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
