Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input.
   - `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `temp` is `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n - 1` and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, the value of `i` will be decremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now `n - 2`.
   - `temp` remains unchanged (it was set to `n - 1` and is not modified within the loop).
   - `ans` will contain the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, where `i` is now `n - 2`.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 2`, `temp` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
