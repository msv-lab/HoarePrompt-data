Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` should be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

4. **Check the condition inside the loop**:
   - The condition inside the loop checks if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - If true, `i` is set to 1 and `temp` is set to 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, the values of `i` and `temp` remain unchanged.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, and given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `n > 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it `i = 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the loop variable `i`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
