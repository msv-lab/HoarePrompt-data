Output State: **`i` is equal to `temp`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`, `temp` is less than or equal to `n-1` and has been decremented to its final value during the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `temp`, which has been decremented to its final value during the last iteration. The variable `n` remains greater than 0. The list `ans` will contain all the absolute differences between elements in `a` and the corresponding elements in `b`, starting from `a[temp]` to `a[n-1]` and `b[-(n-temp)]` to `b[0]`. The variable `temp` will be less than or equal to `n-1` and will not change further as the loop has completed.
