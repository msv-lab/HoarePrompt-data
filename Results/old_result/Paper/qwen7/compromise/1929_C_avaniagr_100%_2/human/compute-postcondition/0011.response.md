Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned the values from splitting the string `s`. The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` remains greater than or equal to `x + 1`; otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x`.
