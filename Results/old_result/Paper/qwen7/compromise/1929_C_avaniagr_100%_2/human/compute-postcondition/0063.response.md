Postcondition: **Output State: The loop will execute \( x - k + 3 \) times. After all iterations, \( z \) will be the result of repeatedly applying the operation \( z += z // (k - 1) + 1 \) starting from its initial value. \[*open(0)\] remains a list with at least 2 elements. \( k \) is an integer from the split string, and \( x \) is an integer from the split string. The value of \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( z \).**
