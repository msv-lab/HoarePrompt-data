You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop processes each line of input until there are no more lines to process. For each line, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are read and used to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'. If `x < k - 1` and `a >= x + 1`, it prints 'YES' and checks if `a` remains greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `x == k - 1` and `a >= x + 2`, it prints 'YES' and does not change `a`. If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` as described in the loop and checks if `a >= z` before printing 'YES' or 'NO'. After processing all lines, the final state of `[*open(0)]` will be a list containing the remaining lines of input that were not processed, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will reflect the last set of values read from the input.
    #
    #In summary, the output state after the loop executes all iterations will be a list `[*open(0)]` containing any remaining unprocessed lines of input, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will be the last values read from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but uses internal variables t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), k (an integer between 2 and 30), x (an integer between 1 and 100), and a (an integer between 1 and 10^9). It returns an error message if t is less than 1 or greater than 1000, k is less than 2 or greater than 30, x is less than 1 or greater than 100, or a is less than 1 or greater than 10^9. Otherwise, it does not return anything specific and might perform some operations based on these parameters.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
