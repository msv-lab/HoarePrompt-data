Based on the initial state provided, the precondition does not give us specific values for \(x\), \(k\), \(z\), or any other variables directly relevant to the print statement. However, the print statement itself is straightforward:

```
print('YES')
```

This statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
