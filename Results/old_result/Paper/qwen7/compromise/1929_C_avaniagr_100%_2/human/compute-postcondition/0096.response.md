Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is the first integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `a` is the third integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, and `s` is the third element of `[*open(0)]`. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, no changes are made to the list. Otherwise, the third element of `[*open(0)]` becomes a string indicating that the loop ran `x - k + 3` times, `i` has the value `x - k + 2`, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` three times. The condition `a >= z` or `a < z` holds true.
