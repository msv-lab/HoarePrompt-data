Output State: The value of `z` will be increased by the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration of the loop from `i = 0` to `i = x - k + 2`. Since the loop runs `x - k + 3` times, `z` will be updated this many times.

To find the final value of `z`, we need to consider its initial value and the effect of the loop. Let's denote the initial value of `z` as `z_initial`. After each iteration, `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Therefore, after `x - k + 3` iterations, the final value of `z` will be:

\[ z_{final} = z_{initial} + \sum_{i=0}^{x-k+2} \left( z_i // (k - 1) + 1 \right) \]

where \( z_i \) is the value of `z` after the \( i \)-th iteration.

Since the exact initial value of `z` (`z_initial`) is not provided, we can express the final state of `z` in terms of its initial value and the number of iterations:

Output State: The final value of `z` is the initial value of `z` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each of the `x - k + 3` iterations.
