Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned the values from splitting the string `s`. `x` is equal to `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `z` will be the initial value of `z` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each of the `x - k + 3` iterations.
