#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is a string, a and b are lists of non-negative integers with length n, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: pergunta is the minimum value of (x + a[i]) for all i where 0 ≤ i < m, and x is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of (a[i] and b[i]) for all i where 0 ≤ i < n.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value of (cumulative sum of min(a[i] and b[i]) for 0 ≤ i < n) + a[i] for 0 ≤ i < m))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lists, `a` and `b`, of non-negative integers of length `n`. It calculates a cumulative sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. Additionally, it finds the minimum value of a modified `pergunta` variable, which is updated based on the cumulative sum and elements of list `a` up to index `m-1`. Finally, it prints and returns the minimum value of `pergunta` after processing.
