### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `pergunta` to infinity (`float('inf')`) and a variable `x` to 0.
   - It iterates through the list `a` from the last element to the first.
   - For each element `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
     - It adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `pergunta`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pergunta` is initialized to infinity, which is correct because we need to find the minimum cost.
   - `x` is initialized to 0, representing the accumulated cost.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `i` is within the first `m` positions, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation is correct. When moving to a position `i`, the cost is the sum of the cost to move from `j` to `i` (where `j < i`), which is stored in `x`, plus the cost to move from `j` to `i` itself (`a[i]`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `i` might be out of bounds for `m` correctly by only updating `pergunta` when `i < m`.

### Verification Using Annotations

- **Initial State**: 
  - `pergunta` is `float('inf')`
  - `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers
  - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that `1 <= m <= n <= 200000`

- **Loop Invariant**:
  - At the start of each iteration, `x` represents the cumulative cost to move from the last position to the current position `i`.
  - `pergunta` is updated to the minimum cost to move to any position `i` where `i < m`.

- **Final State**:
  - `pergunta` holds the minimum cost to move to one of the first `m` positions.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The annotations and the original assessment accurately reflect the program's behavior.
