Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `n`: The number of elements in array `a`.
   - `m`: The number of elements in array `b`.
   - `k`: An even integer between 2 and 2 * min(n, m).
   - `a`: An array of integers.
   - `b`: An array of integers.

2. **Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each tuple in `cases`, where each tuple contains `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
   - For the loop to start, `cases` must contain at least one tuple. If `cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `cases` is a list of tuples, and each tuple must contain valid values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, we need to ensure that `cases` is non-empty and contains valid tuples.
   - The state of `results` being an empty list is not relevant to the loop execution, as the loop modifies the state within its body, but does not depend on the initial state of `results`.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the presence of at least one valid tuple in `cases`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cases` is a list that must contain at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even, and each element of arrays a and b is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.**
