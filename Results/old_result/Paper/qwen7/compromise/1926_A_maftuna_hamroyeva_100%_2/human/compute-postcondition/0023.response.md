Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string, `l` is equal to the total number of 'A' characters in `a`, `h` is equal to the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`, and `j` is the last character of `a` after the loop has completed. Additionally, the number of 'A' characters in `a` is greater than the number of non-'A' characters in `a`.
