Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings across all test cases are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `a` is a string representing the input for that iteration, `l` is the total count of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` is the count of all other characters in `a`. The final output of the program will be a sequence of 'A' or 'B' based on whether `l` (the count of 'A' characters) is greater than `h` (the count of non-'A' characters) for each string `a`. If `l` is greater than `h` for any string `a`, the corresponding output will be 'A'; otherwise, it will be 'B'.
    #
    #In summary, the final output state will consist of a series of 'A' or 'B' characters, one for each input string processed, determined by the comparison of the counts of 'A' and non-'A' characters in each string.
