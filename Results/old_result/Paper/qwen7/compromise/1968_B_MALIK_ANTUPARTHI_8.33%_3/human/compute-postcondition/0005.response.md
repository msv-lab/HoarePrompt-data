Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is 0.**

The code initializes `k` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, or `e`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
