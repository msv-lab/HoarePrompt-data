Output State: **`b` must be greater than 3, `i` is `b + 2`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `j` is 3, `k` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, `k` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
