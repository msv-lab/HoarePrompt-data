Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is either `2` or `1` depending on whether `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and `j` is `1`. After executing the if-else block, `k` is set to either `2` or `1` based on the specified conditions, and the other variables retain their original values as described in the precondition.
