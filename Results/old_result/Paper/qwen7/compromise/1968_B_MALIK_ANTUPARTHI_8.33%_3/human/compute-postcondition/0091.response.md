Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 2, and the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`.**

Explanation: The code `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` finds the index of the character at position `j` (which is 2) in the string `d`, and then increments this index by 1. This value is stored in `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
