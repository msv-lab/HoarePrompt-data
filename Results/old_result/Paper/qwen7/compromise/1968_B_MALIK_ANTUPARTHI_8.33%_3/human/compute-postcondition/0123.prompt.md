Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is updated to the new value of the first input integer, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is 0, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 2.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is either `j + 1` (if the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`) or 2 (if the character at position `j` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`), `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 2, `i` is `b + 2`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, and `k` is updated based on whether the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `c` or `k`. Specifically, if the character is present and `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 2`; otherwise, `k` remains 3. Additionally, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, and `j` remains 3. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 3, `i` is `b + 2`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `j` is 3, and `k` is either the index of character `d[j]` in string `e` plus 1 or 3, depending on whether `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
