Output State: **`b` must be greater than 2, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is 3, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
