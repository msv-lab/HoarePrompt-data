Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is either `j + 1` (if the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`) or 2 (if the character at position `j` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`), `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
