Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 3, `i` is `b + 2`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `j` is 3, `k` is the index of character `d[j]` in string `e` plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
