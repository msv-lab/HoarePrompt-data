Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `j + 1`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `b`, `c`, `i`, `k`, `d`, and `e`. It only signifies that the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
