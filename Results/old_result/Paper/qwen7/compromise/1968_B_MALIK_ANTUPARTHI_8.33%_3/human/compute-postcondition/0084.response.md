Output State: **`b` is updated to the new value of the first input integer, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is either `2` or `1` depending on whether `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is `2`.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers, assigning the first to `b` and the second to `c`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `d`, `e`, `j`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
