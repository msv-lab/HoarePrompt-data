Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1, and either `k` is the index of `d[j]` in list `e` plus one, where if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is equal to `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1, and `j` must be the next integer in the range [0, `b-1`]. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `d[j]` is not found, `k` is set to `j`, and the most internal loop or if statement is also broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j + 2`. If `k` equals `c` or if `j` reaches `b - 1`, the loop or conditional block is exited. If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, the same conditions apply but the loop or conditional block is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
