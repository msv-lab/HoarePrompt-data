Output State: **`b` must be greater than 2, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is 3, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The code `k = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 3) to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
