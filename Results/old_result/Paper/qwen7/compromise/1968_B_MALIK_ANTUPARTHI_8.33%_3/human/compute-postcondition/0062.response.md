Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `j + 1`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and `j` is `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `k` while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.
