Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `b` is given as `b + 1`.
   - `i` is given as `b + 1`.
   - `k` is given as 0.
   - `d` is an input string.
   - `e` is an input string.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for j in range(b)` will execute if `b` is at least 1 (since `range(b)` includes numbers from 0 to `b-1`).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `b`, we need to ensure `b` is at least 1.
   - The other variables (`i`, `k`, `d`, `e`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `b` must be greater than 0.

So, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is 0, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string**
