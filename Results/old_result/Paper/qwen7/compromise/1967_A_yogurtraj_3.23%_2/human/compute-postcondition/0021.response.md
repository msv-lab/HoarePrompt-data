Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2. So, `rem` is assigned the value of `k % 2`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
