Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `n` remains greater than 1 as no operation changes its value. The variable `k` is updated by subtracting the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `3 * (a[2] - a[1])` since `i` is now 2.
