Output State: **`i` is 7, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[8] + 0 // 8`, `rem` is `0 % 9`, `y` is `n - 8`**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`i`, `r`, `rem`, and `y`) are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain unchanged. Specifically, `r` is now `a[8] + 0 // 8`, which simplifies to `a[8]` since `0 // 8` is `0`. Similarly, `rem` is `0 % 9`, which is `0`. And `y` is `n - 1 - 7`, which simplifies to `n - 8`.
