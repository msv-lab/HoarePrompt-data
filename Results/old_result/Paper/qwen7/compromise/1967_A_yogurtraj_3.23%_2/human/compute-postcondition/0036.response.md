Output State: **`i` is 2 - (a[3] - a[2]), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is updated by subtracting (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) from its current value, `r` is a[i + 1], `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Here, `i` was previously defined as `2 - (a[3] - a[2])`, `n` was greater than 1, `k` was updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value, and `r` was 0. After executing `r = a[i + 1]`, `r` now holds the value of `a[i + 1]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
