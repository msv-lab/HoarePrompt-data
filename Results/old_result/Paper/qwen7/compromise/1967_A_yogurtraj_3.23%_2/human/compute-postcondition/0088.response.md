Output State: **`i` is 7, `n` is greater than 8, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[7] + 0 // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 3`, `ii` is 0, `r` is equal to `a[n - 1]` since `k // n` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Given that `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[n - 1]`. Since `n` is greater than 8, `n - 1` is a valid index for the list `a`, and thus `r` is set to `a[7]` (because `n - 1` equals 7). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
