Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it implies that the `break` statement is within an implicit context (like an unshown loop or conditional). The values of `i`, `k`, and `rem` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, `i` is still 8, `k` is still 0, and `rem` (which is `k % 9`) is also 0. The `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block.
