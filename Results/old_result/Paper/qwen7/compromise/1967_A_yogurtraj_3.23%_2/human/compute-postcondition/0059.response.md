Output State: **`i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + 0 // 4`, `rem` is `0 % 4`, `y` is `n - 1 - 3`, `k` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `r` is now `a[3] + 0 // 4`, `rem` is `0 % 4`, and `y` is `n - 1 - 3`.
