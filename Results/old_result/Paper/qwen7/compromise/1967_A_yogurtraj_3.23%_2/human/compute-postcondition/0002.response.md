Output State: **`a` is a list containing two integers converted from the input, `n` is the first positive integer entered, `k` is the second positive integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` are the first and second positive integers entered respectively, they remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains these two integers.
