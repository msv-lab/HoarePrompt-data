Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is `a[3]`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is -1.
   - `k` is equal to 0 (this is redundant since `k` was already defined as 0).

2. **Expression in Print Statement:**
   - The expression is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

3. **Substitute Values:**
   - `r` is `a[3]`. Since `r` is derived from `a[3]`, let's assume `a[3]` is some value, say `x` (since the actual value of `a[3]` is not provided, we'll use `x` as a placeholder).
   - `n` is greater than 1, so let's assume `n = 2` for simplicity (the exact value doesn't matter as long as it's greater than 1).
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is -1.

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - Substitute the values into the expression: `(x - 1) * 2 + 1 + 0 - 1`.
   - Simplify the expression: `(x - 1) * 2 + 0 = (x - 1) * 2 = 2x - 2`.

Since `r` is `a[3]` and we don't have the actual value of `a[3]`, we'll keep it as `x` for the final expression.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2x - 2 (where x is the value of a[3])**
