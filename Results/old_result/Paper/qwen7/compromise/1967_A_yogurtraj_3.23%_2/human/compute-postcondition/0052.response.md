Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either 0 or not 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is -1, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The line `rem = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `rem`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `y`, `ii`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
