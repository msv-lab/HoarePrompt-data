Output State: **`i` is 8, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `rem` is `0`, and `y` is `n - 8`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to be `a[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 8, `i + 1` is 9, so `r` becomes `a[9]`. The other variables (`k`, `rem`, and `y`) are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.
