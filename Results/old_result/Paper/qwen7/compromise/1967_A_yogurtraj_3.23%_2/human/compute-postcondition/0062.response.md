Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, and `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The condition for `n` also remains the same, i.e., `n` must be at least 2. The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value. Since the exact value of `k` was not given, it is expressed as `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.
