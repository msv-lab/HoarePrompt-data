Output State: **`i` is 8, `r` is `a[9]`, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `rem` is `0`, and `y` is `n - 8`**.

Explanation: The code `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` decreases the value of `k` by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given that `i` is 8, the expression simplifies to `(8 + 1) * (a[9] - a[8])`, which is `9 * (a[9] - a[8])`. The other variables (`r`, `rem`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
