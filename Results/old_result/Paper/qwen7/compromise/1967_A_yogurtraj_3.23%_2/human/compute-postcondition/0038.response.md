Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `y` is -1, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, and `rem` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is updated to `2 - (a[3] - a[2])`, `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` is 0.**
