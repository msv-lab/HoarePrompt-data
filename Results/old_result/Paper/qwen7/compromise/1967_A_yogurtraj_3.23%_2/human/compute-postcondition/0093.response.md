Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for ii in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `ii`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**:
   - `i` is 7.
   - `n` is greater than 8.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is `a[7]`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is `n - 3`.
   - `ii` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` provides a non-negative integer value. Since `ii` starts at 0, the loop will increment `ii` by 1 in each iteration until `int(input())` returns a value that makes `ii` exceed the input value.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `ii` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `ii` will be 1 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1).
- `i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 7, `n` is greater than 8, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[7]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 3`, `ii` is 1**
