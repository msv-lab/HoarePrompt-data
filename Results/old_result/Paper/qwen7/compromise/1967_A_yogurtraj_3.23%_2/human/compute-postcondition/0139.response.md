Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be printed step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `r` is `a[n-1]`
   - `k` is 0
   - `rem` is 0
   - `y` is 0

2. **Expression to be Printed:**
   \[
   (r - 1) \times n + 1 + \text{rem} + y
   \]

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   - Since `r` is `a[n-1]`, substitute `r` with `a[n-1]`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.

   So the expression becomes:
   \[
   (a[n-1] - 1) \times n + 1 + 0 + 0 = (a[n-1] - 1) \times n + 1
   \]

4. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - The expression simplifies to \((a[n-1] - 1) \times n + 1\).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1**
