Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `a` of size `n`.

2. **Sorting and Initialization**: The list `a` is sorted, and initial variables `r`, `rem`, and `y` are set.

3. **Main Logic Loop**:
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list `a` up to `n-1`.
   - It checks if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` to determine when to stop the loop and update `r`, `rem`, and `y`.
   - If the condition is met, it updates `r` to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, sets `rem` to `k % (i + 1)`, and calculates `y` as `n - 1 - i`. Then it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the condition is not met, it subtracts `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from `k` and updates `r` to `a[i + 1]`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - After the loop, if `k` is not zero, it updates `r` to `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - It prints the result using the formula `(r - 1) * n + 1` if `k` is not zero, otherwise it uses the formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

5. **Output State**:
   - The state after the loop indicates that `ii` (the test case index) is equal to the total number of test cases.
   - `r` is set based on whether `k` is zero or not.
   - `rem` and `y` remain 0 as they are only updated within the loop and not reset outside it.

Given the logic and the provided example, the program appears to correctly calculate the maximum score for each test case based on the constraints and requirements. The logic for updating `r`, `rem`, and `y` seems appropriate for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
