You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `l` will be equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements from the start of the list up to the second last element. The variable `r` will be 0, indicating that the search has gone through the entire list from the start to the end. The variable `st` will also be equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements from the start of the list up to the second last element, and `end` will be equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements from the end of the list up to the second last element plus 3 (as it was increased by 3 in each iteration). The value of `ans` will be calculated based on the final positions of `l` and `r`, and the values of `st` and `end`. Specifically, if `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or the first element of the list `a[0]` is equal to the last element `a[-1]`, then `ans` will be `r - l` (which is `0 - l` or simply `-l`). Otherwise, `ans` will be `r - l - 1` (which is `-l - 1`).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `l` and `st` will both reflect the count of consecutive identical elements from the start of the list, `r` will be 0, `end` will reflect the count of consecutive identical elements from the end of the list plus 3, and `ans` will be the length of the list minus `l` if certain conditions are met, or `length - l - 1` otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the program does not account for the optimal way to perform the operations to minimize the cost. Specifically, the program only checks for consecutive equal elements at the start and end of the array and does not consider other possible segmentations that could result in a lower cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program would incorrectly output `4` because it only considers the segments `[1, 1]` and `[5, 5]`, but the optimal solution would be to change all elements to `2` or `4`, resulting in a cost of `3`.

Another example is:
```
5
1 2 2 2 1
```
The program would incorrectly output `3` because it only considers the segment `[1, 1]` and `[5, 5]`, but the optimal solution would be to change all elements to `2`, resulting in a cost of `2`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
