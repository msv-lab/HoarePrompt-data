Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head conditions are `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

2. **Analyze Each Condition**:
   - The first condition `r > l` ensures that the loop can continue as long as `r` is greater than `l`.
   - The second condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` ensures that the elements at positions `r` and `r - 1` in the list `a` are equal.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `end` is increased by 1 (this state does not affect the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer (this state does not affect the loop).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (this state does not directly affect the loop, but it influences the values in `a`).
   - `l` is equal to `r - 1`.
   - `r` must be greater than `l`.
   - `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` if `l` is 2, and so on until `l` equals `r - 1`.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than `l` and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.
   - Since `l` is always `r - 1`, the condition `r > l` is always true.
   - Therefore, the only condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to continue is `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`end` is increased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` if `l` is 2, and so on until `l` equals `r - 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**.
