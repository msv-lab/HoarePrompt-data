Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

2. **Analyze the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `l`: The left index.
   - `r`: The right index.
   - `a[l]`: The element at the left index in the list.
   - `a[l + 1]`: The element at the next index in the list.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
     - `l < r` must be true.
     - `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` is 0, for `l < r` to be true, `r` must be greater than 0.
   - We need to check if `a[0] == a[1]` to satisfy the second condition. If `a[0] != a[1]`, then the loop will not execute even if `l < r` is true.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:
- `r` must be greater than 0.
- `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 0, `r` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0**.
