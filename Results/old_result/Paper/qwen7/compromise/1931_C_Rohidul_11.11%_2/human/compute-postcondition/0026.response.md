Output State: `end` is increased by 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, `r` is the last index of the list `a`, and `a[l]` is equal to `a[r]`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `l` will be equal to `r - 3`, meaning the loop has processed all consecutive equal elements at the start of the list `a`. The variable `st` (renamed to `end` in the given context) will hold the count of how many times the loop executed, which is 3 in this case. This indicates that the first 3 elements of the list `a` were all equal, and the loop reduced `r` by 1 each time it executed, stopping when `r` became equal to `l + 3`.
