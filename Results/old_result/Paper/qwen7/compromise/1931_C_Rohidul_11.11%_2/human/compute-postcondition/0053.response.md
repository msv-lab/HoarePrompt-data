Output State: **`st` is equal to `st + 1`, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` must be greater than `l`, and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The other variables (`st`, `r`, and `a[l]`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `st` remains equal to `st + 1`, `l` becomes `l + 1`, `r` must still be greater than `l`, and `a[l]` must still be equal to `a[l + 1]`.
