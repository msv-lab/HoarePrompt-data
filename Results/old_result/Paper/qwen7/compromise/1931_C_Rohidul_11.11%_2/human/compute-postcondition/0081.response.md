Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for as many times as the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **Input**: The value of `input()` will change with each iteration, so let's denote it as `new_input`.
   - **Variables inside the loop**: The variables `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `end`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `ans` will all be reset or updated based on the new input.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` will be set to the new input integer.
   - `a` will be a new list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `l` will be set to `n - 2`.
   - `r` will be set to `0`.
   - `a[r] == a[r - 1]` will be checked; since `r` starts at `0`, `a[r - 1]` does not exist yet, so this condition will initially be `False`.
   - `end` will be set to `n - 1`.
   - `ans` will be determined based on the conditions given:
     - If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `-1`.
     - Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `a[0] != a[-1]`, and `-2` otherwise.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is False, `end` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is determined based on the conditions above.**

To summarize, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is False, `end` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is determined based on the conditions above.**
