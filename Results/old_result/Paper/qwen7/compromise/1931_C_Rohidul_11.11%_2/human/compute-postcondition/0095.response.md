Output State: `l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-1`, `r` remains the same as the initial value, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-1`.

To explain further, since the loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, it will keep incrementing `l` and adding to `st` until it finds a pair of elements that are not identical or until `l` reaches `r`. The final value of `st` will be the count of all consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list up to but not including `r`. The value of `l` will be the position right after the last identical element sequence. The variable `r` remains unchanged from its initial value because it was not modified within the loop.
