Output State: **`end` is increased by 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, `r` is the last index of the list `a`, `a[l]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, `st` is 0, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = len(a) - 1` calculates the length of the list `a` and subtracts 1 from it, storing the result in `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
