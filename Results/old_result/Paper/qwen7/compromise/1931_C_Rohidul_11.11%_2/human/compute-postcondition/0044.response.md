Output State: **`end` is increased by 6, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r` with values `0` and `n - 1` respectively. The values of `end`, `n`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `l` is explicitly set to `0` and `r` is set to `n - 1`.
