Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the last index of the list `a`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]` if `l` is 2, and so on until `l` equals `r`, `st` is the total number of times the loop has executed, `end` is 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `l` will be equal to `r`, indicating that the loop has processed all consecutive equal elements at the start of the list `a`. The variable `st` will hold the count of how many times the loop executed, which is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of the list.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `end` is increased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]` if `l` is 2, and so on until `l` equals `r-1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `end` is increased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` if `l` is 2, and so on until `l` equals `r - 2`, and `a[r - 1]` must be equal to `a[r - 2]`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `end` is increased by 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, `a[r - 1]` is equal to `a[r - 2]


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
