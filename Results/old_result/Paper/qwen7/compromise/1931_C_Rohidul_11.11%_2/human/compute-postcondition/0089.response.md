Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `l` and `r`, and the array `a`.
3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `st` is increased by 1, and `l` is increased by 1.
4. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.
   - Since `l` is increased by 1, the new value of `l` is `l + 1`.
   - To satisfy `l < r`, `l + 1` must still be less than `r`.
   - To satisfy `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, the element at index `l + 1` must be equal to the element at index `l + 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `l + 1 < r` and `a[l + 1] == a[l + 2]` for the loop to continue.
   - Since `l` is already increased by 1, we need to increase `l` again to check the next pair of elements.
   - Therefore, `l` should be increased by 1 again.

Given these points, the state adjustments required are:

- Increase `l` by 1.
- Ensure `l + 1 < r`.
- Ensure `a[l + 1] == a[l + 2]`.

However, since the problem only allows us to adjust the states in the loop head, we focus on `l` and `r`.

Thus, the state adjustment is:

State: **`st` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `l + 1 < r` and `a[l + 1] == a[l + 2]`**.

But adhering strictly to the format and only adjusting the loop head variables:

State: **`l` is increased by 1, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, and `a[l + 1] == a[l + 2]`**.

Since the problem specifies only adjusting the loop head variables, the final answer is:

State: **`l` is increased by 1, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`**.
