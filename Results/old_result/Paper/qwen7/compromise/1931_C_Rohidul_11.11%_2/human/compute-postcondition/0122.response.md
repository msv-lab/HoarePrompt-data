Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `l` will be equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements from the start of the list up to the second-to-last element, `r` will be 0, `st` will be the same as the total number of consecutive identical elements from the start of the list up to the second-to-last element, `end` will be the total number of consecutive identical elements from the end of the list up to the third element, and `ans` will be calculated based on the following conditions:
- If `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l - 1`.

This means that after all iterations, `l` and `r` will effectively collapse to the boundaries of the list due to the removal of consecutive identical elements from both ends, and `ans` will reflect the length of the remaining distinct segment of the list, adjusted according to the specified conditions.
