Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 1, `r` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0**.

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
