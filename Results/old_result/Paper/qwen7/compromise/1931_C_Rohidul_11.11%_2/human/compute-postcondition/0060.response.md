Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head conditions**: The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with the condition that consecutive elements in the list are equal until the end of the list is reached
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `n - 2`
   - `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true
   - `end` is 1

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition is `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
   - Currently, `r` is `n - 2` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true.
   - For the loop to continue, `r` must still be greater than `l` (which is 0) and `a[r]` must still be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `r` is `n - 2`, for the loop to continue, `r` must remain `n - 2` or decrease but still be greater than `l` (0).
   - However, since `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, this condition is already satisfied.
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `r` to ensure it remains greater than `l`.

5. **Final state**:
   - `total` is 0 (unchanged)
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
   - `a` is a list of integers (unchanged)
   - `l` is 0 (unchanged)
   - `r` must be `n - 2` or a value greater than 0 but still less than or equal to `n - 2` to satisfy `r > l`
   - `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true (unchanged)
   - `end` is 1 (unchanged)

Therefore, the final state to proceed to the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` must be `n - 2` or a value greater than 0 but still less than or equal to `n - 2`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, `end` is 1**
