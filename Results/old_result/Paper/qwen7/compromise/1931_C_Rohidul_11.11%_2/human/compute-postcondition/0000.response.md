Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its value doesn't matter for the loop to execute.
   - The expression `int(input())` reads an integer from the input. This integer represents the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input is a valid positive integer. Given the constraints, the input will always be a valid positive integer since it is specified that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop will always execute given the constraints, no specific state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, we need to ensure that the input is within the specified range.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the only relevant state to consider is the input itself, but since the input is guaranteed to be within the specified range, no adjustment is necessary.

**Final Answer**:
State: **No specific state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The input will always be a valid positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
