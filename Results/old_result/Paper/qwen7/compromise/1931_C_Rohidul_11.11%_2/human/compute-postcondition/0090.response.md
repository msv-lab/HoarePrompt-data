Output State: **`l` is increased by 2, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`**

Explanation: Initially, `l` was increased by 1, and `r` must be greater than `l + 1`. After executing `l += 1`, `l` is further increased by 1, making it increased by 2 in total. The condition for `r` remains unchanged, so `r` must still be greater than `l + 1`, which now translates to `r` being greater than `l + 1` (since `l` is now increased by 2).
