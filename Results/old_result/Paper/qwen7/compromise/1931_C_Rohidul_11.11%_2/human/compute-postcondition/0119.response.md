Postcondition: `l` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `end` equals `end + 3`, and `ans` is calculated as follows: if `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l` if the if condition `a[0] == a[-1]` is true, otherwise `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
