Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 0, 0
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = r - l - 1
    elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        ans = len(a) - 1
    else:
        ans = r - l
    print(max(0, ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `end` is increased by 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, `r` is the last index of the list `a`. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with the condition that consecutive elements in the list are equal until the end of the list is reached, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is false, `end` is `n - 1`, and if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `-1`; otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `a[0] != a[-1]` and `-2` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `l` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `end` equals `end + 3`, and `ans` is calculated as follows: if `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l` if the if condition is false, otherwise `ans` is `r - l - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
