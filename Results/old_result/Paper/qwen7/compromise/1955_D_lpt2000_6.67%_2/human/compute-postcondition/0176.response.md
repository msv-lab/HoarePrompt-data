Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is either `D[out_aa] - 1` or remains greater than 0. Additionally, if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, it is now `E[out_aa] - 1`; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.
