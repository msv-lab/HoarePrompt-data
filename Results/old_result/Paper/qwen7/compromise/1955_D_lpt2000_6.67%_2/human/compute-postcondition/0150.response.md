Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is an integer, `D[out_aa]` is an integer, `C[out_aa]` is an integer; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] - 1`; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] - 1`, `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`, and `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1`.**

This output state reflects that `E[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1. Depending on the initial value of `E[out_aa]`, either `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 (if it was greater than 0) or both `D[out_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` are updated accordingly while `E[out_aa]` is also decreased by 1.
