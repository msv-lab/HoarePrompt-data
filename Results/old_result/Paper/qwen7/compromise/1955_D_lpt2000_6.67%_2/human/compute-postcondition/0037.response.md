Postcondition: **`fnd` is 1 if `tot` (sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` is 0; `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m` to the end; `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - m`; regardless of the if condition, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it is greater than 0, and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it is greater than 0; otherwise, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; if `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; if `C[in_aa]` was equal to `D[in_aa]` in the if part, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**
