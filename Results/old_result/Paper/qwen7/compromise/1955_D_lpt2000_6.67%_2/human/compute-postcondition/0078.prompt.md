Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `fnd` is 1 if `tot` (sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` remains 0; `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m` to the end; `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - m`; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it is greater than 0, and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it is greater than 0; otherwise, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; if `D[in_aa]` was equal to `D[in_aa]` in the if part, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` remains 0; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`; `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m+1` to the end; `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - (m + 1)`; `D[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` are each increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `C[in_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` are not greater than 0, `D[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` are each increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, if `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, `C[in_aa]` is further increased by 1, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
