Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m+2` to the end, `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - (m + 2)`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` are each increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `D[in_aa] += 1` increases the value of `D[in_aa]` by 1. The other conditions and slices remain unchanged, so they are included in the output state.
