Postcondition: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` remains 0. `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `D[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` are each increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, `C[in_aa]` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes in the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
