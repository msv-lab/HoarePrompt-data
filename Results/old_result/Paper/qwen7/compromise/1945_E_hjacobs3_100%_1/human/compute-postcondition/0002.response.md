Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while r - l > 1:`. The variables involved here are `r` and `l`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `r - l > 1`.

3. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n`.

4. **Check the Condition with Current Values**:
   - With `l = 0` and `r = n`, the expression `r - l` becomes `n - 0 = n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 0 > 1` must be true, which means `n > 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `l` is already 0, no adjustment is needed for `l`.
   - We need to ensure that `r - l > 1`, which translates to `n > 1`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n and n must be greater than 1**
