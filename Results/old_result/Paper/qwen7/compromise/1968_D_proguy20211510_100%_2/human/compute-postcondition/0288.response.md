Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 2, `curr` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 1. The code updates `curr` to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. Given the initial state, `preb` is `pathb[0]`, and `i` is 1, so `curr` becomes `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `k < i + 1` is not checked here since `i` is updated to 2 after this line of code, and the loop or if statement would only break if `k < i + 1` was false initially.
