Postcondition: `resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3))`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k + paths[i]`, `i` is 5, `curr` is `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3)`. If `k` is less than `i + 1` (which is 6), then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
