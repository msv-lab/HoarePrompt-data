Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p, and an array a. For each test case, it constructs two paths based on the permutation and calculates the maximum possible values for these paths under a given constraint k. It then compares these values and prints 'Bodya' if the first path's value is higher, 'Sasha' if the second path's value is higher, or 'Draw' if both values are equal. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
