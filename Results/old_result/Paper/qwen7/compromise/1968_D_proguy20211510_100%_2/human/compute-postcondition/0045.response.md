Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`, `paths` now contains the elements `a[ps - 1]` added to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. Since `ps` was already updated to `p[ps - 1]` before this line of code, the new value of `ps` is used to access `a[ps - 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
