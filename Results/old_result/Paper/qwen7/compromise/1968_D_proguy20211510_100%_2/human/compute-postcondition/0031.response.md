The only variables in the loop head are none, since the `while True` loop does not depend on any variables to determine whether it should execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged**
