The `while True` loop does not have any condition based on the variables in the loop body. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any specific states based on the loop condition. Since the loop will always execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of, we only need to ensure that the loop can continue executing without breaking.

Given the information:

- `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1.
- `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged.
- `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.
- `paths` now contains the elements `a[ps - 1]` added to it.
- The loop breaks if `vis[ps - 1]` equals 1.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute unless it hits a `break` statement. In this case, the loop will break if `vis[ps - 1]` equals 1. However, since we need to ensure the loop can continue, we need to make sure that `vis[ps - 1]` does not equal 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `vis[ps - 1]` should not be 1.

State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, and `vis[ps - 1]` must not be 1; `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged; `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`; `paths` now contains the elements `a[ps - 1]` added to it**
