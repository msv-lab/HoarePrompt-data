Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `curr`, and `ress` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` is created and contains the integers read from the input.
