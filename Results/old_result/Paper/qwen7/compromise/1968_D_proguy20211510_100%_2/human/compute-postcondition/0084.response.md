Output State: **`i` is the length of `pathb`, `preb` is 0, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`**.

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates the value of `ress` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr`. The values of `i`, `preb`, `pathb`, `len(paths)`, `pres`, and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
