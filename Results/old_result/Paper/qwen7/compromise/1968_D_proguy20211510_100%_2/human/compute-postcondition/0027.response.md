Output State: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer; `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer; `pb` remains unchanged; `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())`; `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1]] * (number of iterations)`; `paths` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to append `a[pb - 1]` to `pathb` and update `pb` to `p[pb - 1]` until `vis[pb - 1]` becomes 1. After the loop completes, `pathb` will contain the element `a[pb - 1]` repeated for each iteration of the loop, which is determined by how many times the loop executed. Since the loop breaks when `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `pathb` will have as many elements as the number of iterations it took for `vis[pb - 1]` to become 1. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
