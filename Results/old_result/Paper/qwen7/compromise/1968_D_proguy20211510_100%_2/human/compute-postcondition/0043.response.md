Postcondition: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged; `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`; `paths` now contains the elements `a[ps - 1]` added to it; if `vis[ps - 1]` equals 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
