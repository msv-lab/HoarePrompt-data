Output State: **`i` is 2, `pres` is `pres` + `paths[0]` * (`k` - 0), `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates the value of `ress` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, `i` and `pres` retain their initial values, and `ress` is updated to ensure it holds the maximum value between its previous value and `curr`.
