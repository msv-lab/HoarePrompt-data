Postcondition: `i` is `length_of_pathb + 2`, `preb` is `0`, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is `pres + paths[length_of_pathb] + paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, and if `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
