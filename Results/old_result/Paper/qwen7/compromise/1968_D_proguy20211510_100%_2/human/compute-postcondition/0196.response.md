Output State: **`i` is 1, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[0]` * (`k` - 0), `paths` must have at least one element, and if `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The variable `curr` is assigned the value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, which translates to `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)` since `i` is now 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
