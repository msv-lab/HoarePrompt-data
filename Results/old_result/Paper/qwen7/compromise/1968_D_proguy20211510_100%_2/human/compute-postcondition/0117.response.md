Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `p`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `curr`, `ress`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
