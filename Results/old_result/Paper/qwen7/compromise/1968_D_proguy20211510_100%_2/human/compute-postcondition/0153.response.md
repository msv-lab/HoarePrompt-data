Output State: **`vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now the final value reached when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1], ...]` (where the number of elements is determined by how many times the loop executed until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`), `paths` includes `a[ps - 1]`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop. Since the loop was responsible for updating `ps`, `curr`, and potentially modifying `pathb` and `paths`, these variables retain their last values before the loop exited. The `vis`, `pb`, `ress`, and other variables remain unchanged as they were not directly modified within the loop. We also note that the loop has been broken out of.
