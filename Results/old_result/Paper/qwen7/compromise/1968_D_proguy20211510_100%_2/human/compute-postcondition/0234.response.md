Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `i` is the length of `pathb` + 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is the same as the previous value if it was updated or the original value otherwise, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `pb` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `ps` is the integer value of the fourth element of the input split, `p` is a list containing the integers from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

This means that the `vis` list has been updated such that the element at the index `pb` - 1 is now set to 1, while all other elements remain 0. All other variables retain their previous states.
