Output State: **`preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[i]`, `pres` is `0`, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `2`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`**

Explanation: The code updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. Since `curr` is defined as `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` will now be updated to be the maximum of its original value and this new `curr` value. The other variables remain unchanged.
