Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `preb` is `0`, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pres` by adding `paths[i]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `pres` is updated to its previous value plus `paths[i]`.
