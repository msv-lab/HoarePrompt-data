Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer; `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer; `pb` remains unchanged; `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())`; `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1]]`; `paths` is an empty list; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified within the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program exits the current context (if it was inside a loop or conditional). All the variables retain their previous values and states as described in the initial state.
