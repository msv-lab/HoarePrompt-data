Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 4, `curr` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `i`, and `curr` remain as they were in the initial state.
