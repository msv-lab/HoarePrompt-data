Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `pathb` and `paths` as empty lists. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `curr`, and `ress`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values and conditions.
