Output State: **`i` is the length of `pathb`, `preb` is 0, `pathb` is a list, and `len(paths)` is a constant determined by the initial state of `paths`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `i`, `preb`, `pathb`, and `len(paths)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
