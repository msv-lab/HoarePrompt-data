Output State: **`preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[3] + pathb[3]`, `pres` is `0`, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `3`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[3] * (k - 3)`, `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`, and `k` is updated to be `i + 1` if `k < i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `preb += pathb[i]` increments `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`, where `i` is 3. So, `preb` changes from `pathb[0] + pathb[3]` to `pathb[0] + pathb[3] + pathb[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
