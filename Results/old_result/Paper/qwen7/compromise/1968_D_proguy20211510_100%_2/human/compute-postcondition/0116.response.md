Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from strings to integers. The values of `curr` and `ress` remain unchanged from their initial definitions. The precondition that `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` were strings is no longer valid, as they are now integers. All other variables and their relationships remain the same.
