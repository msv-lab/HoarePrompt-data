Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3))`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k + paths[i]`, `i` is 4, `curr` is `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3)`**.

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates the value of `ress` to be the maximum between its current value (`ress`) and the value of `curr`. Given that `curr` is defined as `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3)`, `ress` is now updated to be `max(ress, paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3))`. All other variables remain unchanged.
