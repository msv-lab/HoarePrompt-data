Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[0] * k`, `i` is 2, `preb` is increased by `pathb[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of `resb`, `i`, or `preb`. It only exits the loop or if statement it is currently inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
