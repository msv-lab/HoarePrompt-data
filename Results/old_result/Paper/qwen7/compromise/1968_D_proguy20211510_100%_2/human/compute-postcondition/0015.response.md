Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
