You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `resb` will hold the highest value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` will be 0, `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` will be 0, `i` will be equal to `len(pathb)`, and `curr` will be the final computed value before the loop exits. Additionally, `resb` will be greater than or equal to `ress`.
    #
    #To explain this in more detail:
    #- `resb` retains the highest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop.
    #- `ress` is reset to 0 after the loop completes because no further comparisons are made.
    #- `preb` accumulates the sum of all elements in `pathb` as the loop progresses.
    #- `pres` is reset to 0 at the start of each outer loop iteration.
    #- `i` will be equal to `len(pathb)` after the loop exits, indicating the last index processed.
    #- `curr` will be the final computed value before the loop exits, which is compared against `resb` and `ress` during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p, and an array a. For each test case, it constructs two paths based on the permutation and calculates the maximum possible values for these paths under a given constraint k. It then compares these values and prints 'Bodya' if the first path's value is higher, 'Sasha' if the second path's value is higher, or 'Draw' if both values are equal. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of a player moving to their new position multiple times within a single turn. This can significantly affect the final scores.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `k = 2`, `P_B = 1`, `P_S = 1`
- `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
- `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

According to the problem description, both players start at position 1. In the first turn, both players will stay at position 1 and add `a[1]` to their score. In the second turn, both players will move to their new positions (which are `p[1] = 2` for both). However, the program only considers the score contribution once per turn, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        def calculate_score(start_pos, k):
            path = []
            pos = start_pos - 1
            while True:
                path.append(a[pos])
                pos = p[pos] - 1
                if pos == start_pos - 1:
                    break
            return max(sum(path[:i]) * (k - i) + sum(path[i:]) for i in range(len(path) + 1))

        resb = calculate_score(pb, k)
        ress = calculate_score(ps, k)

        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

This corrected version ensures that the score is calculated correctly by considering all possible movements within a single turn.
