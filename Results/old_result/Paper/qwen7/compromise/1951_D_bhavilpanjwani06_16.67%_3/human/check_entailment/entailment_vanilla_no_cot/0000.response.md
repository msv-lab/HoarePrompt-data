Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program only processes one test case within `func_1()` and does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Logic for Determining Yes/No**: The logic used to determine whether it is possible to have Alice buy exactly `k` jewels is flawed. Specifically:
   - The condition `if n < k:` is too restrictive; it should check if it's possible to distribute the coins across the stalls.
   - The condition `elif n == k:` is not sufficient because it doesn't account for the possibility of distributing the coins across multiple stalls.
   - The condition `elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:` is also incorrect and overly simplistic.

3. **Output Format**: If the answer is "YES", the program should output the number of stalls and the prices for each stall, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Check if it's possible to buy exactly k jewels
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        # Determine the number of stalls needed
        stalls = 0
        current_price = 1
        while n >= k:
            if n >= current_price:
                n -= current_price
                k -= 1
                stalls += 1
                current_price += 1
            else:
                break
        
        # Check if we managed to buy exactly k jewels
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(stalls)
            print(' '.join(str(current_price - i) for i in range(stalls)))
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected program properly handles multiple test cases and correctly determines whether it is possible to have Alice buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up at most 60 stalls with appropriate prices.
