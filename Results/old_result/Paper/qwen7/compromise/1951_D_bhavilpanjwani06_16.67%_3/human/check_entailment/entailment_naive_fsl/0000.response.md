Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where more than two stalls are needed to achieve the desired number of jewels \( k \).

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `255 8`

The correct solution would involve setting up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels. However, the program only considers two cases:
1. When \( n < k \), it prints "NO".
2. When \( n \geq k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \), it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.

This approach is insufficient because it does not account for scenarios where more than two stalls are required. For instance, in the given example with \( n = 255 \) and \( k = 8 \), the correct setup would be to use eight stalls with prices \( 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 \), but the program incorrectly prints "NO".

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
