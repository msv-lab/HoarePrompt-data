Output State: **`x` is an integer, and there exists an integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`; `l` is a list containing the element `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `x` is divisible by `i` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the value of `x // i` is added to the list `l`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
