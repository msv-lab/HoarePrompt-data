Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is `x // n`, `l` contains the maximum divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` to be the integer division of `x` by `n`. The values of `x`, `n`, `l`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
