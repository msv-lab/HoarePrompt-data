The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables `x`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of these variables.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is `x // n`, `l` contains the maximum divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.**
