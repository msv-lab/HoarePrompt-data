Output State: **`i` is 3, `l` is `[ans, 3, x // 3]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 3, the value appended to `l` is `x // 3`. The original elements of `l` are `ans` and `3`. Therefore, the updated list `l` becomes `[ans, 3, x // 3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 3.
