Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `l` is a list containing three elements which are `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the current value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in list `l`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.
