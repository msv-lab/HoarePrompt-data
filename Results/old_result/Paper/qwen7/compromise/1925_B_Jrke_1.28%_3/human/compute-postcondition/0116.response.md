Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `l` is a list containing three elements which are `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and the current value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in list `l`. If `x % i == 0` holds true, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value among the elements in list `l`.
