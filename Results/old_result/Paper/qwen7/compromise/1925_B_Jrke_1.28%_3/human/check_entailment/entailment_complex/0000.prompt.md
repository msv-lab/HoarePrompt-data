Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = x // n
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `l` will contain all such divisors, and `ans` will be the maximum value among these divisors.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The loop iterates through all odd numbers up to the square root of `x`, checking if they are divisors of `x` and updating `ans` with the maximum divisor found that meets the criteria. The list `l` keeps track of these divisors, ensuring that `ans` is always updated to the maximum value found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( x \) and \( n \). It calculates the maximum divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{n} \) (if \( \frac{x}{n} \geq 1 \)), and prints this value. If \( \frac{x}{n} < 1 \), it directly prints 1. The function implicitly accepts three variables \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \) across multiple test cases, where \( t \) is the number of test cases, and for each test case, \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq x \).
