Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly updates the position of an object based on the direction of movement. It handles all four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and updates the position accordingly. This function is used to update the positions of players and Bludgers, which is essential for the game logic.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function checks for collisions between players and Bludgers. When a player's position matches a Bludger's position, the player is marked as eliminated and removed from the game. The function then prints the elimination event in the correct format. The function sorts the players alphabetically before printing, ensuring that the elimination events are printed in the required order.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly initializes the game state by parsing the input and storing the positions of players, goals, and the Bludger.
   - The main loop processes each action in the game. It correctly handles catching and throwing the Quaffle, updating the score when a team successfully scores, and marking players as eliminated when they collide with a Bludger.
   - The final score is calculated and printed correctly after processing all actions.

Given that all parts of the program handle the game logic correctly according to the problem description, the program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
