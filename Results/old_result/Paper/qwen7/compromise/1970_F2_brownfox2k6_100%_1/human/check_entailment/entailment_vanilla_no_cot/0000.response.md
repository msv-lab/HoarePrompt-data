Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code snippet includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but neither of these functions are used in the context of the problem description. The problem requires handling a complex game scenario involving multiple entities (players, Quaffle, Bludgers, and goals) over multiple steps. However, the given functions do not seem to be part of the solution logic.

To correctly implement the solution, you would need to:
1. Parse the initial state of the field.
2. Track the movements and actions of players and balls over the given number of steps.
3. Handle scoring and elimination rules.
4. Output the events and final score.

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not contribute to the core logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
