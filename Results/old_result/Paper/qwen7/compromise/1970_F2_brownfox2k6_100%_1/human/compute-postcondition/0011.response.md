Postcondition: `out` is an empty list, `t` is an integer, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If the value of `player[p]` is `blud`, then `out` will contain the key `p`, `t` remains unchanged, and `player[p]` is updated to `[-1, -1]`. If `player[p]` is not `blud`, then `out`, `t`, and `player` remain unchanged.
