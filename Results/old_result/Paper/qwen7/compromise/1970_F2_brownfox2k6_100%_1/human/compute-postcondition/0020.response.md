Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for p in sorted(out)`. The key variables here are `p` and `out`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `out` that can be sorted and assigned to `p`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `p` is the current element from the sorted `out`.
   - `out` is the list that has been sorted.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - After each iteration, `p` takes the next value from the sorted `out`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `out` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `p` will be the next element from the sorted `out`.
   - `out` should still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`p` is the next element from the sorted `out`, `out` must contain at least one element**
