The function accepts a list `obj` containing two integers representing a position on the field and a string `d` representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). Depending on the direction, it updates the position by modifying the elements of `obj`. Specifically, if the direction is 'U', the first element of `obj` is decremented by 1; if the direction is 'D', the first element is incremented by 1; if the direction is 'L', the second element is decremented by 1; and if the direction is 'R', the second element is incremented by 1. The function returns the updated position `obj`.
