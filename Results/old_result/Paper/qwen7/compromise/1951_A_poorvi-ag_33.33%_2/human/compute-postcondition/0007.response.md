Output State: The output state depends on the values of `start`, `end`, and `t`. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, if the input string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and has '11' as a substring, the list `results` appends 'no'. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and meets the previous condition, it also appends 'no', otherwise it appends 'yes'. If the number of '1's is odd, it appends 'no'. The final output state will be a list of strings ('yes' or 'no') printed for each iteration based on the conditions described.
