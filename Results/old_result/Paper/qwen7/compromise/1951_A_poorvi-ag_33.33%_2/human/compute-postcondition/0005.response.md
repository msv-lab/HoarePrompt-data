Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for r in results:`. The only variable here is `r`, which iterates over the `results` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of `results`**: The `results` list is constructed based on the conditions inside the loop. However, the initial state before the loop starts does not provide specific information about the contents of `results`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element `r` in the `results` list. Since the loop itself does not modify the `results` list (it only iterates over it), the focus should be on ensuring that the `results` list is properly initialized and contains the correct elements based on the conditions described.

4. **Conditions for appending to `results`**:
   - If the input string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and has '11' as a substring, append 'no'.
   - If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and meets the first condition, append 'no'.
   - If the number of '1's is odd, append 'no'.
   - Otherwise, append 'yes'.

5. **Initial state requirements**: Since the loop iterates over `results`, the list `results` must be properly initialized with elements based on the conditions above. The initial state of `results` should reflect the conditions under which the elements are appended.

Given these points, the initial state before the loop starts should ensure that the `results` list is correctly initialized based on the conditions described.

**State:**
- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `results` is a list that must be initialized based on the conditions described for appending elements ('no' or 'yes').

Since the exact content of `results` cannot be determined without knowing the input string `arr` and the value of `t`, the state should reflect the requirement that `results` is initialized according to the specified conditions.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list that must be initialized based on the conditions described for appending elements ('no' or 'yes')**.
