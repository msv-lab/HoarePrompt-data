def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')

            if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
                results.append('no')
            else:

    #State: Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing elements based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, if the input string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and has '11' as a substring, the list `results` appends 'no'. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and meets the previous condition, it also appends 'no', otherwise it appends 'yes'. If the number of '1's is odd, it appends 'no'.
    for r in results:
        print(r)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the values of `start`, `end`, and `t`. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, if the input string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and has '11' as a substring, the list `results` appends 'no'. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and meets the previous condition, it also appends 'no', otherwise it appends 'yes'. If the number of '1's is odd, it appends 'no'. The final output state will be a list of strings ('yes' or 'no') printed for each iteration based on the conditions described.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `arr`. It checks if the string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and includes the substring '11'. If so, it appends 'no' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'yes' if the number of '1's is even, and 'no' if the number of '1's is odd. Finally, it prints the contents of the results list.
