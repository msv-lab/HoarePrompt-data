Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case by reading the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Condition Checking**: The program checks if Alice's initial row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's initial row position (`c`). If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot reach Bob's position before Bob reaches the first row.

3. **Midpoint Calculation**: If Alice's initial row position is not greater than Bob's, the program calculates the midpoint `x` as half the absolute difference between `a` and `c`.

4. **Range Calculation**: Based on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, the program calculates the range for the column positions (`l` and `r`) for either Alice or Bob.

5. **Tolerance Check**: The program checks if the other player's column position falls within the calculated range with a specified tolerance (`x+1` for Alice and `x` for Bob).

6. **Output Determination**: Depending on the results of the above checks, the program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw".

Given the detailed explanation and the correctness of the logic implemented, the annotated program accurately reflects the problem statement and handles all edge cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
