Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time using an incorrect formula. Specifically, the line `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlaps between the intervals where fireworks are visible from both installations.

To find the correct solution, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. The correct approach involves calculating how many fireworks are visible within one LCM period and then determining how many such periods fit into `m`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        lcm = a * b // math.gcd(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from the first installation
        A = (m // a) + 1
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from the second installation
        B = (m // b) + 1
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from both installations
        C = (m // lcm) + 1
        # The maximum number of fireworks seen at the same time
        ans = A + B - C
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program properly accounts for the overlaps and calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.
