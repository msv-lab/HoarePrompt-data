Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period of `m` minutes.
     - `A = m // a + 1` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation.
     - `B = m // b + 1` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation.
   - However, the formula `A + B` does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Overlapping fireworks occur when a firework from the first installation and a firework from the second installation are launched around the same time.
   - The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap. The number of simultaneous fireworks is given by `A + B - GCD(a, b)` where `GCD(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

3. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks seen simultaneously is:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1 - \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{LCM}(a, b)} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Here, `LCM(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}`.

4. **Review of the Given Code**:
   - The given code calculates `A` and `B` correctly but incorrectly sums them without considering the overlap.
   - The formula `A + B` overcounts the overlapping fireworks.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

Correctness: **False**
