Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. According to the problem description, the formula used in the program `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect. This formula assumes that each installation will launch a firework exactly `m` minutes after the previous one, which is not necessarily true. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `6 7 4`
- Expected Output: `2`

However, using the given formula:
- `A = m // a + 1 = 4 // 6 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `B = m // b + 1 = 4 // 7 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `ans = A + B + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`

This result is incorrect because the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously is `2`, not `4`. The correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculating the number of fireworks launched within the visibility period `m`.

Since the program does not handle the problem correctly for at least one input case, the correctness is **False**.
