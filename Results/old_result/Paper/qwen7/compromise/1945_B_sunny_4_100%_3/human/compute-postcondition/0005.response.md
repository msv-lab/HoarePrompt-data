Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, a, b, and m, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and a, b, and m are integers between 1 and 10^18. For each test case defined by t, the function returns a result based on the values of a, b, and m.**

This means the function indirectly accepts multiple parameters (t, a, b, m) through its processing logic and returns a result for each test case defined by t.
