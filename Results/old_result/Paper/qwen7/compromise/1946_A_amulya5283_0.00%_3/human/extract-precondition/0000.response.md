Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (each a_i is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The length of each array a is between 1 and 10^5, and the sum of all lengths n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
