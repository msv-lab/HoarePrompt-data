Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components.
   - It iterates through the test cases, correctly parsing the number of elements in each test case and the elements themselves.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It sorts the array to find the median.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum number of operations needed to make the median larger than its current value.

3. **Heap Usage**:
   - The code creates a min-heap from the elements starting from the median index.
   - It repeatedly increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each increment is counted as an operation.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. However, since the problem specifies the median as the element at the ceiling of `k/2`, this approach correctly handles both odd and even-sized arrays.
   - The code correctly handles arrays with duplicate elements, as the heap ensures that the smallest element is always incremented.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
