Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is n // 2; `current_median` is arr[median_index]; `heap` is arr[median_index:].**

Explanation: The code creates a new variable `heap` which is assigned the slice of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of the array. All other variables remain unchanged.
