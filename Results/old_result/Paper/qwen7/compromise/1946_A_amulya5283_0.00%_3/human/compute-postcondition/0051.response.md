Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `arr[median_index]` to the variable `current_median`. Since `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is set to `arr[n // 2]`. The sorting of `arr` and the value of `median_index` remain unchanged.
