Output State: **`operations` is 4, `smallest` is the new value after removing the smallest element from the heap, and `heap` has been updated by removing its smallest element.**

Explanation: The line `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This operation changes the state of the `heap` by removing its smallest element. The `operations` variable remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it, and the condition `smallest + 1 <= current_median` still holds true since only the value of `smallest` has changed.
