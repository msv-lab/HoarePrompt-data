Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap without the smallest element, `operations` is 5, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `smallest + 1` is pushed onto `heap`, and `heap[0]` is now the new smallest element in the heap.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Since `operations` was initially 4, after executing this line, its value becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
