Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (each a_i is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The length of each array a is between 1 and 10^5, and the sum of all lengths n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
