Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap without the smallest element, `operations` is 3, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `smallest + 1` is pushed onto `heap`, and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`; `smallest` is the smallest element of `heap` before popping.**

Explanation: The code pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. The heap is then modified by pushing `smallest + 1` back onto it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
