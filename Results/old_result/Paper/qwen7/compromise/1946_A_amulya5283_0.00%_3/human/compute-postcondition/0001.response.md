State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, `i` should start from 0 and `t` must be a positive integer.
3. **Initial State of `results`**: The problem statement mentions that `results` is initially an empty list, which does not affect the loop's execution directly.
4. **Initial State of `test_cases`**: Since the loop iterates over `t` test cases, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

Thus, the required adjustments are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `t` must be a positive integer.
- `test_cases` must have at least one tuple.

Final State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `i` is 0**.
