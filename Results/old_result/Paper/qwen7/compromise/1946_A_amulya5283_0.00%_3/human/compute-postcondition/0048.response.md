Output State: **`n` is equal to `test_cases[i][0]`, `arr` is equal to `test_cases[i][1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of `test_cases[i]` to `n` and the second element to `arr`. Since `test_cases[i]` is not defined in the initial state, we can only say that `n` is now equal to the first element of `test_cases[i]` and `arr` is now equal to the second element of `test_cases[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
