Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`; `heap` is converted into a min-heap; `operations` is 3; `smallest` is the smallest element in `heap` after removing the smallest element; `heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1` and the new smallest element is the new root of the heap.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the heap. Since `heap` is a min-heap, the smallest element is removed and replaced with `smallest + 1`. The heap property ensures that `heap[0]` (the root of the heap) is the smallest element in the heap, which is now `smallest + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
