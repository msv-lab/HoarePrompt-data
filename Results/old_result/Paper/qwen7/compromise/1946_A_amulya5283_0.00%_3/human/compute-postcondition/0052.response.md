Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a list starting from `arr[n // 2]` to the end of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `heap` which starts from the element at index `median_index` (which is `n // 2`) and includes all elements from that point onwards until the end of the list `arr`. All other variables (`arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
