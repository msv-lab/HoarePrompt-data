Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1 and the smallest element is now the previous smallest element plus 1; `operations` is 3; `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 1; `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `arr[n // 2] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. Since the heap is a data structure where the smallest element is always at the root (`heap[0]`), after popping the smallest element, the value of `smallest` is the previous smallest element from the heap. The operations count is decremented by 1, so `operations` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
