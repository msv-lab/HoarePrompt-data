Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a min-heap. This means that the smallest element in `heap` is now at the root of the heap (index 0), and the heap property is maintained throughout the list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
