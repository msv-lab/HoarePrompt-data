Output State: **`k` is 2, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `k` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `t2` is dependent on the values of `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, which remain unchanged. The value of `j` is incremented by 1.
