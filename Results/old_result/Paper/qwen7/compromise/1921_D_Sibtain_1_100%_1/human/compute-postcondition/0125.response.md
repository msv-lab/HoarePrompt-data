Output State: **`k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)` plus the previous value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += max(t1, t2)` adds the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to `ans`. Since `t1` and `t2` are defined as `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` respectively, their values remain unchanged. The value of `k` remains 2 because it was not affected by the code. The value of `ans` is updated to include the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.
