Output State: `k` is `0`, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k` starting from `len(a) - 1` down to `0`, `i` is the final value determined by the loop conditions, `j` is the final value determined by the loop conditions, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index within the loop, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` with `j` being the last updated index within the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` will be `0` because it starts from the length of `a` and decrements until it reaches `0`. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration. The values of `i` and `j` will reflect their final states after the loop has completed, determined by the conditions inside the loop. `t1` and `t2` will represent the absolute differences calculated in the last iteration of the loop.
