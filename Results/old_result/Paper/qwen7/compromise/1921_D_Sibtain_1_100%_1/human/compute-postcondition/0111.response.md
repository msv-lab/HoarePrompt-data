Output State: **`k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2)`**

Explanation: The code updates `t1` to be the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. The other variables (`k`, `t2`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t1` is updated, while `k`, `t2`, and `ans` retain their initial values.
