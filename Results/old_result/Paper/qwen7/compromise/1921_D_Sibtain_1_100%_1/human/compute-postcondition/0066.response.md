Postcondition: `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 2.
