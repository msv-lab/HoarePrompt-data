Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `j` from 1 to 2 and calculates `t2` as the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
