You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- Program:
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x):
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if a[inx] == x:
        return inx + 1
    return inx

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list `a` of n integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and an integer `n` indicating the length of the list. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) is calculated based on the value of `inx` determined by the logic inside the loop: if `inx` is less than or equal to 0, then `ans[i] = 2 - inx`; otherwise, `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx`. Additionally, the last element of the list `left` is updated to be the sum of all elements in the list `a`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not properly handle the scenario where a slime cannot eat any of its neighbors due to being the smallest in its segment. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
2 2 3 1 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```
However, the program will incorrectly output:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```
But let's analyze the third slime (index 2):
- Initially, the sizes are [2, 2, 3, 1, 1].
- The third slime (size 3) can eat either the first or the second slime, but after eating one of them, the sizes become [2, 3, 1, 1] or [3, 2, 1, 1], respectively.
- In both cases, the fourth slime (size 1) cannot eat any of its neighbors because it is the smallest.
- Therefore, the third slime (size 3) should eventually be eaten by the fifth slime (size 1), making the correct answer for the third slime `-1`.

The program fails to account for such scenarios where a slime becomes the smallest and cannot eat any neighbors, leading to an incorrect result.
