Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `ans`[2] is 1, `inx` is less than or equal to 0, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
