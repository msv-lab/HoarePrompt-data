Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves three variables: `i`, `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `i` will eventually become `n-1` (the last iteration).

3. **Determine the Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last element of the list `a`.
   - The list `left` will have its last element updated to be the sum of all elements in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the Initial States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and run to completion.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to 1.
   - The value of `n` should be such that the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1 (to ensure the loop runs at least once)

Since the list `last` and the list `left` are not directly involved in the loop head, their states do not need to be adjusted.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
