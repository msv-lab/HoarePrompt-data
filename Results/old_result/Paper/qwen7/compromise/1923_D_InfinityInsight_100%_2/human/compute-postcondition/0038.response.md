Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `inx` is the return value of `func_1(left, x)`, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `inx = func_1(left, x)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(left, x)` to the variable `inx`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
