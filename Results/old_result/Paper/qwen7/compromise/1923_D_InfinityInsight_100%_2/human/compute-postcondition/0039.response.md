Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `inx` is the return value of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[0]`, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `inx2 = last[i - 1]` assigns the value of `last[0]` (since `i - 1` equals `0`) to `inx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
