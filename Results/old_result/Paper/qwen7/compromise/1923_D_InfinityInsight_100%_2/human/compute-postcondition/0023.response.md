Output State: **`last` is a list containing the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `left` is a list with its last element increased by `i`.**

Explanation: The code `left.append(left[-1] + i)` appends to the list `left` the value of its last element plus `i`. Here, `i` is the first element of the list `a`. Since no other changes are made to `last` or `i`, their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The `left` list is updated by appending a new value which is the previous last value of `left` plus `i`.
