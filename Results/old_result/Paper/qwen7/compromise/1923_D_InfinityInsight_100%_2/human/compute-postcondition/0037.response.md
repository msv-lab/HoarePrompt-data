Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `left[i] - a[i] - 1` to `x`. Given that `i` is 1, `x` is calculated as `left[1] - a[1] - 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given condition.
