Output State: **The list `last` will contain the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`, and `i` will be equal to `n`.

**Explanation:**
After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The list `last` will contain the index of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`. This is because every time the element `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]`, the index `i` is appended to `last`. If `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`, the last element of `last` is appended to itself, effectively keeping the last index of the previous unique element. Thus, `last` will capture the first occurrence of each unique element in `a`.
