Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`; `last` has its last element appended with itself.**

Explanation: The code `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Since no specific values are given for `last`, we can only state that the last element of `last` is appended to itself. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
