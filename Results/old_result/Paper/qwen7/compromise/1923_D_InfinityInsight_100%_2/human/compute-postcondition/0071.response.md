Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `a` remains unchanged, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`, `ans[4]` is 2 - `inx`.**

Explanation: The code `inx = func_1(left, x)` assigns the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `left` and `x` to the variable `inx`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
