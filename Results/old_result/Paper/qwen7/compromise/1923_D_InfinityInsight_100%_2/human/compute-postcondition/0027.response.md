Output State: **`last` is a list containing the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `left` is a list with its last element increased by the third element of the list `a` plus the last element of `left`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `left` list the value of its last element plus the third element of the list `a` (`i`). This means the last element of `left` is updated. The other variables remain unchanged.
