The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers and an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. It returns -1 if there is no element in `a` that matches `x`. If there is an element in `a` that exactly matches `x`, it returns the index of that element plus one. If no exact match is found, it returns the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`, also plus one.
