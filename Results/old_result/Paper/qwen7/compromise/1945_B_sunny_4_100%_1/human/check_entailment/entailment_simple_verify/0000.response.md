### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand why the original assessment might be incorrect.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Given the frequencies `a` and `b`, and the visibility period `m`, we need to calculate how many fireworks from each installation can be seen at the same time.

#### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        a, b, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        ans = m // a + m // b + 2
        print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code
The annotated code shows that the program reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`, and calculates `ans` using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. Finally, it prints the result.

#### Correctness of the Formula
The formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` is indeed incorrect because it does not account for the overlap in the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations. The correct approach involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the intervals where both installations launch fireworks at the same time.

#### Example Test Case
Consider the test case `6 7 4`:
- The first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes.
- The second installation launches fireworks every 7 minutes.
- Each firework is visible for 5 minutes (from `x` to `x + 4`).

The correct way to solve this would be:
1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period.
3. Account for the overlap.

For `a = 6` and `b = 7`:
- The LCM of 6 and 7 is 42.
- Within the first 42 minutes, the first installation launches fireworks at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 (7 fireworks).
- The second installation launches fireworks at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 (6 fireworks).
- Overlapping fireworks: At 42 minutes, both installations launch a firework simultaneously.

Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2 (one from each installation).

#### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. It uses a simple arithmetic approach without considering the overlap, which leads to incorrect results.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
