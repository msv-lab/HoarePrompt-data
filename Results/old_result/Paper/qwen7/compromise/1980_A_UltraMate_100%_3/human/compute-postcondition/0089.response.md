Postcondition: `i` is the next character in `p`, `p` is the string `p` without the first character, `ans` is `2 * m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `2 * m`.
