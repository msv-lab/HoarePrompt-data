Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `hmp`. The loop will execute as long as `hmp` is not empty.

3. **Determine the Final States**:
   - After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` is 'G'.
   - `p` remains 'ABCDEFG'.
   - `ans` is equal to `3 * m`.

4. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to the first element of `hmp`.
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'.
   - `ans` is initially 0 and then incremented by `m` three times during the loop.

5. **Adjusting the Initial State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `hmp`, `hmp` must contain at least one element for the loop to start.
   - The final value of `i` is 'G', meaning that 'G' must be an element of `hmp`.
   - The loop increments `ans` by `m` three times, so `hmp` must have exactly three elements ('A', 'B', 'C') for `ans` to be `3 * m`.

Given these points, the initial state of the variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly are:

- `i` should be the first element of `hmp` (which will be 'A' if 'A', 'B', 'C' are the elements).
- `hmp` must contain the elements 'A', 'B', 'C' for the loop to increment `ans` by `m` three times.
- `p` remains 'ABCDEFG'.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 'A', `hmp` must contain the elements 'A', 'B', 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**.
