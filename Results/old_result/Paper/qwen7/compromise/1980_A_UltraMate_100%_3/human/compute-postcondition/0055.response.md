Output State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states. The output state includes the updated value of `ans` which is the original value of `ans` plus `m`.
