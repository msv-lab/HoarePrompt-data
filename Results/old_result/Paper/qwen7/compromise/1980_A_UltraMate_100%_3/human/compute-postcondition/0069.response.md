Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `hmp`.
   - `i` is an iterator over the elements in `hmp`.
   - `hmp` is a collection (list or set) containing the elements 'A', 'B', 'C'.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 'B'.
   - `hmp` contains 'A', 'B', 'C'.
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'.
   - `ans` is not specified in the postcondition but remains unchanged if the condition is not met.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `hmp`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `hmp`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over `hmp`, and it was 'B' at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `hmp` after 'B'.
   - The next element in `hmp` after 'B' is 'C'.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 'C'.
   - `hmp` remains the same since it is a collection and not modified within the loop.
   - `p` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the condition `hmp[i] < m` is not specified, and no new assignment to `ans` is mentioned.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 'C', `hmp` contains 'A', 'B', 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**.
