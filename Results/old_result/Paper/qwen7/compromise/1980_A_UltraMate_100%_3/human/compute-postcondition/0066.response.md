Output State: **`i` is 'B', `hmp` contains 'A', 'B', 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is `2*m - hmp[i]`**

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is set to `m - hmp[i]` because `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. Given that `i` is 'B', `hmp[i]` (which corresponds to 'B') is 1. So, `ans` is initially `m - 1`. The code then updates `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it, which again is `m - 1`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `2*m - 2`. Since `m` is not defined, we express `ans` in terms of `m`.
