Output State: **`i` is 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string**

The code `p = 'ABCDEFG'` simply reassigns the variable `p` to the string `'ABCDEFG'`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`i`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `s`). Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.
