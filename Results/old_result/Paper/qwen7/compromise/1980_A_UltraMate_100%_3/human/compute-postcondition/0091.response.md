Output State: **`i` is the next character in `p`, `p` is `p` without the first character, `ans` is 2 * `m` + `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `m` to its current value, which was previously `2 * m`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `2 * m + m`, which simplifies to `3 * m`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
