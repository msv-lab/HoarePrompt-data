You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters (`introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`) and calls another function `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. If `func_1` returns a non-None value, the function returns the value of `introverts`. Otherwise, it returns -1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal)
- Expected Output: `-1` (since it's impossible to pair all extroverts with universals)

However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not account for this scenario properly. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
       if extroverts % 3 != 0:
           if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
               return None
       return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
   ```
   This function checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals but does not handle the case where there are too many extroverts and not enough universals to pair with.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   ```python
   def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
       ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
       return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
   ```
   This function uses the result from `func_1` to determine the total number of tents needed. However, it does not handle the case where `func_1` returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to pair all extroverts with universals.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles cases where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals. Here is a corrected version of the functions:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    pairs = min(extroverts, universals // 2)
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts - pairs
    remaining_universals = universals - pairs * 2
    return ceil((remaining_extroverts + remaining_universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    tents_for_extroverts = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if tents_for_extroverts is None else introverts + tents_for_extroverts
```

With these corrections, the program should handle all cases correctly.
