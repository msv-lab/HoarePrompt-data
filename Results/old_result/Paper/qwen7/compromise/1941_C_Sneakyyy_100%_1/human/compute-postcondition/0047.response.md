To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `a` is the new input string.
  - `n` is the new input integer.
  - `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 0 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.
  - `i` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 1 otherwise.

### Loop Condition Analysis:
The loop continues as long as `i < len(a) - 2`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 1 otherwise.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

### Determining the Next State:
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3. For the loop to continue, `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 3, meaning `len(a)` must be greater than 5.
- If `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `i` is 1. For the loop to continue, `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 1, meaning `len(a)` must be greater than 3.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition depends on `i` and `len(a)`.
- Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- Since `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and the loop requires `i < len(a) - 2`, `len(a)` must be greater than 5.
- If `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` is 1, and the loop requires `i < len(a) - 2`, `len(a)` must be greater than 3.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 0 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 1 otherwise, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and `len(a)` must be greater than 3 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'**.
