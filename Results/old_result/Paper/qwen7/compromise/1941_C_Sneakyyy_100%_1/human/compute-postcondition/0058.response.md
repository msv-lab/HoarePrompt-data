Output State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 1 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` is 5 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 5 otherwise, where `s` is `a[3:6]`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 6; `s` is updated to `a[i:i + 3]`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 6 (if `s` was 'map' or 'pie') or 4 (otherwise) to 7 (if `s` was 'map' or 'pie') or 5 (otherwise). However, since `s` is updated to `a[i:i + 3]`, and `i` now is 5 (or 7), `s` will be `a[5:8]` (or `a[7:10]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
