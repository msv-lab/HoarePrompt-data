Output State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 'a[0:3]'**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` slices the string `a` starting from index `i` (which is initially 0) and ending at index `i + 3` (which is 3). So, `s` is set to the substring of `a` from index 0 to index 2 (inclusive), which is represented as `'a[0:3]'`. The values of the other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
