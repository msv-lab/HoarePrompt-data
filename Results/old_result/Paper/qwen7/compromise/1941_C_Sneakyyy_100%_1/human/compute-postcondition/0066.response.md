Output State: **`a` is a new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is the last index processed plus 1, and `a` is reassigned to the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = input()` takes a new input string and assigns it to the variable `a`. The other variables (`n`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
