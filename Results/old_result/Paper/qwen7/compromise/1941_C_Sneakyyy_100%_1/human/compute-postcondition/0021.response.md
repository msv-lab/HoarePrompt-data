Postcondition: **`a` must have a length of at least 6, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 4, `s` is updated to be the substring of `a` starting from index 4 and having a length of 3.**
