Postcondition: `a` must have a length of at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3.
