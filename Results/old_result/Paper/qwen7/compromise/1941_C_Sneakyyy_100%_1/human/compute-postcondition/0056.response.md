Output State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 1 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` is 9 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 7 otherwise, where `s` is `a[3:6]`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 6; `s` is updated to `a[i:i + 3]`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is set to 6 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 4 otherwise.
- After executing `i += 3`, `i` is incremented by 3.
- If `s` was 'map' or 'pie' (i.e., `i` was 6), then `i` becomes 9.
- If `s` was neither 'map' nor 'pie' (i.e., `i` was 4), then `i` becomes 7.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `ans`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `s` is now updated to `a[i:i + 3]`.
