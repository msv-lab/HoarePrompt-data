Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string and counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". However, the logic in the program is flawed because it increments the index `i` by 3 every time it finds either "map" or "pie", which means it skips over other potential instances of these substrings that might start at different positions in the string. This approach does not ensure that the minimum number of deletions is made to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

To correctly solve the problem, we need to remove the minimum number of characters such that no "map" or "pie" substrings remain. This requires a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that carefully removes characters to break up the unwanted substrings.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly count the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
