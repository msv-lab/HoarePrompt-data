Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains an error in the logic of `func_1`. Specifically, the approach to constructing the sequence `nums` does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Initialization**: The line `nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` initializes the first element to the largest possible value with the bit length of `k`, which might not be optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

2. **Incorrect Update Logic**: The loop that follows tries to distribute the remaining value of `k` among the other elements, but it does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. Instead, it simply adds the minimum possible value (`min(nums[0] + 1, k)`), which is not always optimal.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider how to distribute the values such that the bitwise OR is maximized. One effective approach is to use the largest possible powers of 2 that fit within the constraints, ensuring that the bitwise OR of the sequence includes as many 1s as possible.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    # Create a list of zeros
    nums = [0] * n
    # Fill the list with the largest possible powers of 2 that fit within the constraints
    power_of_2 = 1
    while k > 0:
        if k >= power_of_2:
            nums[n-1] += power_of_2
            k -= power_of_2
        power_of_2 *= 2
    return nums
```

This function ensures that the sequence is constructed in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
