Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where `nums[0]` is (1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is equal to `k` if `k > 0` and 1 otherwise, with `k` being reduced accordingly.
