Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4], and `k` is an integer within the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element `nums[0]` is calculated as (1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1 + `k`. For all subsequent elements `nums[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), the value is `k` if `k` is greater than 0, and 1 otherwise. After the loop, `k` is set to 0.**

This means the function creates a list of length `n` where the first element is derived from `k`, and the rest of the elements are either `k` or 1 depending on whether `k` is greater than 0.
