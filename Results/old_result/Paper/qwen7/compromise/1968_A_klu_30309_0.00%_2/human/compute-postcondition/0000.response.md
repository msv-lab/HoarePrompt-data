Output State: **The function is defined but no value is returned, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is a docstring for a function that aims to find the value of `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`. However, the actual implementation of the function logic is missing. Therefore, after executing this code, the function is defined but no value is returned, and the initial state of `x` remains unchanged.
