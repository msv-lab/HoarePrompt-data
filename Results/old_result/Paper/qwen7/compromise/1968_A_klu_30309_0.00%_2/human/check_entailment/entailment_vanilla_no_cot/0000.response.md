Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not always return the correct value of `y` that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The function checks if \(x \% y == 0\) and if \(2 * y \geq x\). This condition is too restrictive. For example, consider \(x = 10\). The correct answer should be \(y = 5\) because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the maximum possible value. However, the current logic might miss this due to the condition \(2 * y \geq x\).

2. **Optimization**: The function should iterate through all possible values of \(y\) from \(x-1\) down to 1 and keep track of the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y."""
    max_val = 0
    max_y = 0
    for y in range(1, x):
        current_val = gcd(x, y) + y
        if current_val > max_val:
            max_val = current_val
            max_y = y
    return max_y
```

This version correctly iterates through all possible values of \(y\) and keeps track of the one that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Given this, the original solution is incorrect, hence the correctness is **False**.
