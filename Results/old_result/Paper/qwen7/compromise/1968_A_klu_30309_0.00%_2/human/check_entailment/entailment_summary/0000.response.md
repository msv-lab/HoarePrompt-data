Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The function `func_1` iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2, checking if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and if \( 2y \geq x \). If both conditions are satisfied, it returns \( y \); otherwise, it continues the search and updates the maximum value found. If no suitable \( y \) is found, it returns the maximum value found during the iteration.

Given the constraints and the logic of the function:
- The function correctly identifies the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to half of \( x \).
- This divisor will maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) because \(\gcd(x, y)\) will be \( y \) itself, and thus \(\gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2y\), which is maximized when \( y \) is the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to half of \( x \).

Therefore, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
