Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized for a given integer \( x \).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` aims to find the largest \( y \) that satisfies the condition \( 2 \cdot y \geq x \) and is a divisor of \( x \).
   - The loop starts from \( x-1 \) down to 2, checking each \( y \) to see if it is a divisor of \( x \) and if \( 2 \cdot y \geq x \).
   - If such a \( y \) is found, it is immediately returned because the loop decrements \( y \), meaning larger values are checked first.
   - If no suitable \( y \) is found, the function returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to half of \( x \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \(\gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2\).
   - For \( x > 2 \), the function correctly identifies the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2 \cdot y \geq x \). This ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The annotated program correctly prints the result of `func_1(x)` for each test case.
   - Given the constraints and the logic, the function should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Given the above analysis, the function logic and the overall program structure align with the problem requirements and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
