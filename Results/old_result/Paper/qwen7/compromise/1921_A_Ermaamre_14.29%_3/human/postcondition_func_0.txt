The function processes \(t\) sets of coordinates, each containing four points representing the corners of a square. It checks if the given coordinates form a valid square by comparing the x and y coordinates. For each valid square, it calculates the vertical distance between two opposite corners, squares this distance, and prints the result. The function does not return any value but prints the squared distance for each valid square found.
