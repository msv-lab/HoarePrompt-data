Precondition: **There are four lines of input for each testcase, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are \(t\) such sets of coordinates, where \(1 \le t \le 100\).**
