### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to minimize the number of cards left after performing the specified operations.
   - Each operation allows us to exchange `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards (`n`) and the value of `k`.
   - It then reads the values of the cards into a list (`nums`).

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - If `k > n`, we cannot perform any operations, so the result is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, we can only perform one operation, resulting in `k-1` cards.
   - Otherwise, the code calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of card numbers.
     - If `k` appears in the frequency table, we can perform operations until we have fewer than `k` cards of that number, leaving `k-1` cards.
     - Otherwise, no operations can be performed, and the result is `n`.

4. **Reviewing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` correctly creates a frequency table for the card numbers.
   - If the frequency of any number exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.
   - This function is used to check if `k` can be a frequency in the card numbers.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases where `k > n` and `k == n` correctly.
   - However, the logic for checking if `k` can be a frequency in the card numbers is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if k in freq.values():` is incorrect because it checks if `k` is a value in the frequency table, which is always true since `k` is one of the values in the table (as long as there are at least `k` cards of some number).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Incorrect Condition in `func_1`:**
  ```python
  def func_1(arr, k):
      frequency_table = {}
      for num in arr:
          frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
          if frequency_table[num] > k:
              frequency_table[num] = k
      return frequency_table
  ```
  - This function correctly caps the frequency of any number at `k`.
  - However, when checking if `k` can be a frequency in the card numbers, the condition `if k in freq.values():` is incorrect. This condition will always be true because `k` is guaranteed to be one of the values in the frequency table.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - Instead of checking if `k` is in the values, we should check if there are at least `k` cards of any number. This can be done by checking if any value in the frequency table is equal to `k`.

### Corrected Code:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        # Check if there is any number with frequency exactly k
        if any(value == k for value in freq.values()):
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was incorrect because the condition `if k in freq.values():` is flawed. The corrected approach checks if there is any number with a frequency exactly equal to `k`.

**Final: False**
