### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly maps the input values for each test case into variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` representing the height, width, Alice's position, Bob's position, and the board dimensions.

2. **Base Case Check:**
   - The program checks if Alice's row (`a`) is greater than Bob's row (`c`). If true, it prints 'Draw'. This is correct because if Alice is already in a higher row than Bob, neither can capture the other since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up.

3. **Relative Position Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the absolute difference between Alice's row (`a`) and Bob's row (`c`) and checks if this difference is odd or even.
   - If the difference is odd, it calculates the range of possible moves for Alice (`l` and `r`) and checks if Bob's column (`b`) falls within this range.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the range of possible moves for Bob (`l` and `r`) and checks if Alice's column (`a`) falls within this range.

4. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the calculated ranges include Bob's or Alice's current column, the program determines a winner based on the parity of the difference between rows.
   - The logic seems to be flawed here. Specifically, the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` should be checked more carefully.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the board dimensions might cause the calculated ranges to be out of bounds. For example, if `l` or `r` exceeds the board width, the logic might fail.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution has logical flaws in determining the winning conditions and handling edge cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
