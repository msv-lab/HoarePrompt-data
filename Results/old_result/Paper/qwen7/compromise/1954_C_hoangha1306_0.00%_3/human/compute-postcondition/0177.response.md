Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` in the range `range(len(a))`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is the new input string
   - `b` is the new input string
   - `kq1` is either the string `a[0]` or the string `b[0]`
   - `q` is `t`
   - `vt` is 1
   - `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`
   - `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`
   - `kq2` is the string `b[0]` if `a[0] <= b[0]`, otherwise `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string representation of `x`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will increment `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `kq1`, `q`, `vt`, `x`, `y`, and `kq2` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `kq1`, `q`, `vt`, `x`, `y`, and `kq2`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is either the string `a[0]` or the string `b[0]`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `kq2` is the string `b[0]` if `a[0] <= b[0]`, otherwise `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string representation of `x`**
