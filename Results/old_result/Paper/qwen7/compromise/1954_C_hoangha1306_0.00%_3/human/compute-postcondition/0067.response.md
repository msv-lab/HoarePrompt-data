Postcondition: `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `i` is 2, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is either `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x` or a string containing the value of `y` concatenated with itself, `kq2` is either `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y` or a string containing the value of `x` concatenated with itself. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` becomes a string containing the value of `str(y)` appended to it, and `kq2` becomes a string containing the value of `str(x)` appended to it.
