Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings, and `x` and `y` are integers. If `a[2]` equals `b[2]`, then `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `a[2]` to it, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `kq1` is updated by concatenating either the string representation of `x` or the string representation of `y` to it, and `kq2` is updated by concatenating either the string representation of `y` or the string representation of `x` to it. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` becomes a string containing the value of `str(y)` appended to it, and `kq2` becomes a string containing the value of `str(x)` appended to it.**
