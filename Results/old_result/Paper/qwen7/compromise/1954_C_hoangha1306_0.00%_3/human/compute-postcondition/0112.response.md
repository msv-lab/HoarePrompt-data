Output State: **`i` is `len(b) - 2`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `kq2` is `kq2` plus the string representation of `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))**.

This means that the value of `kq2` has been updated by appending the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
