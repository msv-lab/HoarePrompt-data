Postcondition: `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `vt` equals 1; `kq1` is a string containing either the value of `x` or `str(y)` appended to its end, and `kq2` is a string containing either the value of `y` or `str(x)` appended to its end.
