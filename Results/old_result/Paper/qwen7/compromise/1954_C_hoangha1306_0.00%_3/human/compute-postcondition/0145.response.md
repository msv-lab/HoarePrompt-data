Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to `-1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `q` is `t`, `vt` is either `0` or `1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `kq2` is an empty string.**

The code `kq2 = ''` assigns an empty string to `kq2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
