Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the components that will be printed:

1. **`kq1`**: This is a string formed by taking the minimum of each corresponding character from strings `a` and `b`. Since `i` is equal to `len(a)`, it means all characters from both strings `a` and `b` up to the length of `a` have been processed.

2. **`vt`**: This variable is mentioned to be 1, indicating that the loop has entered the else block at least once during the processing of the characters.

Given these details, the `print(kq1)` statement will print the string `kq1`, which is constructed by comparing each character of `a` and `b` and taking the minimum of the two.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is the string formed by taking the minimum of each corresponding character from strings a and b)**
