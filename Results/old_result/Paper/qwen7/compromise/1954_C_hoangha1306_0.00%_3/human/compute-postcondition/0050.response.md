Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing either the value of `x` or `y` depending on the condition `a[1] > b[1]`, and `kq2` is a string containing either `y` concatenated with itself or `x` appended to it depending on the condition `a[1] > b[1]`. If `a[1] > b[1]` does not hold, `kq1` is `str(y)` appended to its end and `kq2` is `str(x)`.
