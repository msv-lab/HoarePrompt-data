The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is `len(b) - 2`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is `kq1 + a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]`, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 2]), int(b[len(b) - 2]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 2]), int(b[len(b) - 2]))**
