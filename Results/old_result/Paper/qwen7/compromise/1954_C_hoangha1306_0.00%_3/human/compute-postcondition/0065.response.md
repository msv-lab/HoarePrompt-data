Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `i` is 2, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `str(y)` appended to it, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `str(x)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to the string `kq2`. Since `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, the value of `kq1` remains unchanged as it only contains the string representation of `y`. The value of `kq2` now includes the string representation of `x` appended to whatever was previously in `kq2`. The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, and `kq1` remain as they were in the initial state.
