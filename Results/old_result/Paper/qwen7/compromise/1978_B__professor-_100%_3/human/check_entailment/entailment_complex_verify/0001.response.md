### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can make by selling `n` buns under the given promotion rules.
   - Bob can choose an integer `k` (where \(0 \le k \le \min(n, b)\)), and the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` coins for the `i-th` bun.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   - It then checks different conditions to calculate the maximum profit:
     - If `b <= a`, it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` gives the maximum profit.
     - If `b - a >= n`, it means selling the first `n` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price gives the maximum profit.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the profit by selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.

3. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The condition `if b <= a` correctly identifies when selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal.
   - The condition `elif b - a >= n` correctly identifies when selling the first `n` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price is optimal.
   - The condition `else` calculates the profit for the general case where `k` is chosen optimally.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The formula used in the code is correct for calculating the profit:
     - For the first `k` buns, the total profit is \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)\), which simplifies to \(\frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2}\).
     - For the remaining `n - k` buns, the total profit is \((n - k) \times a\).
   - The code uses the formula \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n\) for the general case, which is equivalent to \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases correctly:
     - When `b <= a`, the profit is simply \(n \times a\).
     - When `b - a >= n`, the profit is the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `2b - n + 1`, which is \(\frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2}\).
     - For the general case, the profit calculation is correct as well.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. The conditions and profit calculations are accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
