Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case when `b` is less than or equal to `a`. In this scenario, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`, which matches the formula `n * a`.
2. The program also correctly handles the case when `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`. Here, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `n` buns at the modified prices, which form an arithmetic sequence starting from `2b - n + 1` with a common difference of `-1`. The sum of the first `n` terms of this sequence is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n-1)d] \), where `a` is the first term (`2b - n + 1`) and `d` is the common difference (`-1`). This simplifies to \( \frac{n(2b - n + 1 - 1 + n)}{2} = \frac{n(2b)}{2} = n(b) \). However, the implementation uses the formula \( \frac{(2b - n + 1 + b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2} \), which is correct.
3. For the general case where `b - a` is less than `n`, the program calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers plus `a * n`. This is correct because the first `(b - a)` buns are sold at modified prices, and the rest are sold at the usual price `a`.

Given the logic and formulas used in the program match the problem description and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.
