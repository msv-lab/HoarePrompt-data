You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`.
   - It also reads the values of the cubes `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 because Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Sorting the Cubes:**
   - The program sorts the list `a` in descending order.

4. **Comparing Values:**
   - The program compares the value of the favorite cube `x` (which is `a[f]`) with the value of the `k`-th cube after sorting.
   - If `a[k] > x`, it prints "NO" because the favorite cube will not be removed.
   - If `a[k] < x`, it prints "YES" because the favorite cube will definitely be removed.
   - If `a[k] == x`, it checks additional conditions:
     - If `k` is the last element in the sorted list (`k == n - 1`), the favorite cube will be removed.
     - Otherwise, it checks if the value of the `(k-1)`-th cube is less than `x`. If so, the favorite cube will be removed; otherwise, it might not be removed.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling Cases Where the Favorite Cube is Removed:**
   - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube will definitely be removed because it is at a higher index in the sorted list, and the removal process starts from the first `k` elements.

2. **Handling Cases Where the Favorite Cube is Not Removed:**
   - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube will definitely not be removed because it is at a lower index in the sorted list.

3. **Handling Cases Where the Favorite Cube Might Be Removed:**
   - If `a[k] == x`, the program correctly checks if the favorite cube might be removed based on the value of the `(k-1)`-th cube.
   - This ensures that the favorite cube might be removed if it is the last element or if the previous element is smaller.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the cases where the favorite cube might be removed, not removed, or its removal is uncertain based on the given conditions.
