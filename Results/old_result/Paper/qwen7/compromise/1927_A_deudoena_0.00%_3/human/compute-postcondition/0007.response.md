State: **`ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B', `outind` is 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The loop condition `range(len(inpstr))` means that the loop will iterate over the indices of `inpstr`.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(inpstr)`. Since `i` starts at 0, it will always be less than `len(inpstr)` as long as `inpstr` is non-empty.
- No other variables in the loop head (`i`) need adjustment since they are already set to appropriate initial values or conditions.

Therefore, the only state adjustments needed are for the loop variable `i`, which should be set to 0.
