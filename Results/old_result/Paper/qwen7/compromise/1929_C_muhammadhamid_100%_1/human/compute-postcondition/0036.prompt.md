Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 8, `i` is 3.

Explanation: The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and updates `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. After 3 iterations, `i` will be 3. The value of `s` starts from 1 and is updated as follows:
- After 1st iteration: \(s = 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 = 2\)
- After 2nd iteration: \(s = 2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1 = 4\)
- After 3rd iteration: \(s = 4 + 4 // (k - 1) + 1 = 6\)

Following this pattern, after 4 iterations (all iterations of the loop), `s` will be \(6 + 6 // (k - 1) + 1 = 8\). The other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` must be at least 4, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 12, `i` is 101.

Explanation: The loop runs `x` times, and each iteration updates `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting with `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 2. After the second iteration, `s` becomes 4. After the third iteration, `s` becomes 6. This pattern continues, and after `x` iterations, `s` will be \(2^x\). Given that `x` is at least 4, `s` will be \(2^4 = 16 - 4 = 12\) (since the loop starts from `i=3` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the actual number of iterations is `x-2`). Therefore, after all iterations, `s` will be 12, and `i` will be `3 + (x - 1) = 101` if `x` is 98 (the maximum value for `x` under given constraints).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to the number of iterations specified by `x`, `x` retains its initial value from the input (new_x), and `s` is equal to `x * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `x` which was set initially, `x` will still hold the value it had before the loop started, and `s` will be the result of multiplying `x` by the expression `(s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
