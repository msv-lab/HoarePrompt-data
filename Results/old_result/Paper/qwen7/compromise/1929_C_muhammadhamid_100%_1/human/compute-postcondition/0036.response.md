Output State: `i` is equal to the value of `x` which was set initially, `x` retains its initial value from the input (new_x), and `s` is equal to the final value calculated after all iterations of the loop, which is `s = (x * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1))`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `x` which was set initially, `x` will still hold the value it had before the loop started, and `s` will be the result of the final update formula executed for `x` iterations, starting from `s = 1` and updating as `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration. The exact value of `s` depends on the specific values of `k` and `x`, but it will be the sum of the series defined by the loop's update rule after `x` iterations.
