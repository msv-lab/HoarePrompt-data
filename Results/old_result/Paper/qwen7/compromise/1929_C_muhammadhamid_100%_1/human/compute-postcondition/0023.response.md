Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\).
- `x` must be at least 4.
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
- `s` is 12.
- `i` is 101.

The loop runs `x` times, updating `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Given that `x` is at least 4, and after the iterations, `s` will be 12, and `i` will be 101 if `x` is 98 (the maximum value for `x` under given constraints).

Now, let's evaluate the print statement:

```python
print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

Given:
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
- `s` is explicitly given as 12.

Since `a` can be any integer between 1 and \(10^9\), it can either be greater than or equal to 12 or less than 12. However, the specific value of `a` is not provided, so we need to consider both cases:

- If `a` is greater than or equal to 12, the condition `a >= s` evaluates to `True`, and the print statement will output `'Yes'`.
- If `a` is less than 12, the condition `a >= s` evaluates to `False`, and the print statement will output `'No'`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact output without knowing `a`. However, based on the given constraints, the output could be either `'Yes'` or `'No'`.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= 12 else 'No'**
