Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. It initializes `s` to 1, which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can eventually have any number of coins `n`.
4. The loop runs `x` times, updating `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. This formula is derived from the geometric progression and ensures that Sasha can recover from losing up to `x-1` times consecutively.
5. After the loop, it checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s` and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

Given the logic and the explanation provided in the annotated program, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It calculates the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can eventually have any number of coins `n` and compares it with the initial number of coins `a`.

Correctness: **True**
