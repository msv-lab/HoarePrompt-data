Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the logic correctly implements the strategy to check if Sasha can achieve any number of coins \( n \) given the constraints.

1. **Understanding the Strategy**:
   - The program calculates a value `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can eventually have any number of coins \( n \).
   - The formula used in the loop to calculate `s` is:
     \[
     s = 1 + \left(\frac{s}{k-1}\right)
     \]
     This is repeated `x` times. Essentially, this formula is trying to simulate Sasha's betting strategy over `x` consecutive losses.

2. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The program iterates `x` times, updating `s` in each iteration. This is intended to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row.
   - After calculating `s`, the program checks if Sasha's initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes", indicating Sasha can achieve any number of coins; otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Validation Against Examples**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement validate the logic:
     - For the first test case (2 1 7): Sasha can achieve any number of coins with the given strategy.
     - For the second test case (2 1 1): Sasha cannot achieve any number of coins because he starts with only 1 coin and cannot place a bet of 1 coin after a loss.
     - Other test cases follow similar patterns.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when `a` is less than `s`, correctly printing "No".
   - The loop correctly simulates the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the strategy to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins \( n \) based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
