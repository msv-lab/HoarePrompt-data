### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0. This variable is supposed to track the current year when the last sign occurred.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity.
   - For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
   - This formula correctly handles the sequential waiting period for the signs. It ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The approach used in the program is correct. It iteratively updates `start_year` to the next multiple of each periodicity, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially.
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` effectively finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`, thus ensuring the sequential occurrence of signs.

6. **State Annotations:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program after each iteration of the loop. The `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of the current periodicity, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic required to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The formula used in the program is appropriate and ensures the correct sequential occurrence of signs.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
