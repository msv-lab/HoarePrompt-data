Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.

3. **Calculating the Year:**
   - The program uses a loop to calculate the year when the nth sign will occur.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

### Reasoning:

- **Formula Analysis:**
  - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
  - This is a common approach to find the least common multiple (LCM) of a sequence of numbers, but it does not correctly handle the sequential nature of the problem.

- **Sequential Nature:**
  - The problem requires finding the year when the nth sign occurs sequentially, meaning the next sign only happens after the previous one.
  - The given formula does not account for this sequential nature. Instead, it calculates the LCM of the entire list of periodicities, which is not what the problem requires.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - To solve this problem correctly, we need to iteratively update the `start_year` by adding the current periodicity `nums[x]` to the previous `start_year` until we reach the nth sign.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(n):
            start_year += nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year when the nth sign will occur sequentially. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
