Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `start_year` will be equal to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for every `x` in the range of `len(nums)`, `nums` will be a list of integers, and `x` will be the last index value of `nums`.

In simpler terms, `start_year` will be adjusted in each iteration of the loop according to the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the `nums` list. By the end of the loop, `start_year` will reflect the final adjustment based on all elements in `nums`. The variable `x` will take on the value of the last index of the `nums` list after all iterations.
