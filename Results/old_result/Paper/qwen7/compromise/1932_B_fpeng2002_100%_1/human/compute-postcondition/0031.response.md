Output State: **`start_year` is equal to the result of applying the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)` once, `x` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, and `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests -= 1` decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1. The values of `start_year` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
