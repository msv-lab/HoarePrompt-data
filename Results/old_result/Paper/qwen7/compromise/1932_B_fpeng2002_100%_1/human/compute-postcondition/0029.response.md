To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that `start_year` is updated to the result of the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)`. This operation is applied once, and `x` is set to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Operation**: 
   - `len(nums)` gives the number of elements in the list `nums`.
   - `start_year // len(nums) + 1` means `start_year` is divided by the length of `nums`, the quotient is taken, and then 1 is added to it.
   - Multiplying this result by `len(nums)` ensures that `start_year` becomes the smallest multiple of `len(nums)` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.

3. **Final Value of `start_year`**:
   - Since `start_year` is updated to the result of the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)`, it will become the smallest multiple of `len(nums)` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.

Given the above, the value of `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of `len(nums)` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `start_year`.

Output: **the smallest multiple of len(nums) that is greater than or equal to start_year**
