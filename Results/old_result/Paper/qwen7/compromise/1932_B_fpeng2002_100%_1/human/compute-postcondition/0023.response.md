Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is within the range `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the last value it took.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by `1`.
   - Therefore, if the current `x` value is `k`, the next `x` value will be `k + 1`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `x < len(nums)`.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `start_year` remains the same because the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is only evaluated at the start of each iteration.
   - `nums` remains the same because the list itself does not change within the loop.
   - `x` will be incremented by `1` for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `start_year` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `x` will be incremented by `1`.
- `nums` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `x` is `x + 1`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**.
