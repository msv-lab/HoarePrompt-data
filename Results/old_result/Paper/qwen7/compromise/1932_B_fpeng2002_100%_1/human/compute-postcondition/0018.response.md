Output State: **`num_tests` is exactly 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `num_tests` is greater than -1 but since it must be greater than 0, it is exactly 0. The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `num_tests` remains unchanged at 0.
