Output State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `x` is `x + 1`**

Explanation: The code reassigns `start_year` to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This does not change the fact that `x` is updated to `x + 1`. The value of `nums` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated expression for `start_year` and the incremented value of `x`.
