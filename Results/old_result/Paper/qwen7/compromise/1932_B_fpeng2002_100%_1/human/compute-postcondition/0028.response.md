Output State: `start_year` is equal to the result of applying the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)` once, with `x` being equal to `len(nums) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be updated to the final value obtained by performing the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)` where `x` takes the value of the last index in the `nums` list. All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) will retain their final states as dictated by the loop's execution, but the key change will be in the value of `start_year`.
