Output State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // (x + 2) + 1) * (x + 2)`, `x` is `x + 2` and `start_year` is updated to `(start_year // (x + 2) + 1) * (x + 2)`**.

Explanation: The value of `start_year` is recalculated using the new value of `x`, which is `x + 2`. The expression for `start_year` remains the same, but its value is now updated according to the new `x`. The value of `x` itself is also updated to `x + 2`.
