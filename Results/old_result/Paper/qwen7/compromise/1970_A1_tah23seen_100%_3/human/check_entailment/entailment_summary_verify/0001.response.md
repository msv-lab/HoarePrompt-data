### Reasoning

The original assessment identified the need to adjust the sorting logic in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the current implementation sorts the dictionary items in the wrong order for the position part. The lambda function should sort by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {0: 0}
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]), reverse=True)
    for (i, _) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

In this corrected version:
- The `key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])` ensures that the dictionary items are sorted first by balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order.
- The `reverse=True` parameter in the `sorted` function ensures that the items are sorted in the desired order.

Given this correction, the function now correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
