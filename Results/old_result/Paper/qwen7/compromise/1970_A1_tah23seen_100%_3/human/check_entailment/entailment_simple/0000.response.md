Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Here's why:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of the sequence up to each index and stores it in the dictionary `d`.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the keys of the dictionary `d` based on the balance values in ascending order and the positions in descending order. However, it should sort the entire entries of the dictionary (both keys and values) based on these criteria.

3. **Building the Result String**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string `ans` by concatenating the characters from the original string `s` corresponding to the sorted keys. This step is almost correct but misses one crucial detail: the sorted keys should be used to reconstruct the balanced shuffle, not just the characters.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    
    for (i, _) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    
    return ans
```

In this corrected version, the `for` loop iterates over the sorted items directly, ensuring that the characters are added to `ans` in the correct order based on the balance and position.

Given this analysis, the provided program is incorrect because it does not properly reconstruct the balanced shuffle sequence.

Correctness: **False**
