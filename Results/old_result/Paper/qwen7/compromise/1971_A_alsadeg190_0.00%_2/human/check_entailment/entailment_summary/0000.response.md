Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates `t` times, reading pairs of integers `x` and `y` for each test case.
3. Inside the loop, it compares `x` and `y` and prints the larger one first, followed by the smaller one.
4. This matches the requirement to output the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

Given the example provided in the execution summary, the program produces the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the program logic aligns with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
