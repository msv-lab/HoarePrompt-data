Reasoning:
- The problem requires processing multiple test cases where for each pair of integers \(x\) and \(y\), the program should output the minimum followed by the maximum.
- The provided code snippet does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it reads a single integer \(x\) at the beginning and then iterates \(x\) times, which is incorrect because \(x\) represents the number of test cases, not the number of iterations.
- The code inside the loop compares \(x\) and \(y\) incorrectly. It should be comparing the values of \(x\) and \(y\) from each test case, not using the same variable \(x\) for both the number of test cases and the values being compared.
- The correct approach would be to read the number of test cases \(t\) first, then for each test case, read \(x\) and \(y\), and print the minimum followed by the maximum.

Correctness: **False**
