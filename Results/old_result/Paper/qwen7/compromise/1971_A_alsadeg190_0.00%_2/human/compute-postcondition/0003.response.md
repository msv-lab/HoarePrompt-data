Output State: The output state will consist of pairs of integers printed based on the condition in the loop. For each iteration `i` in the range of `x`, the program reads two integers from input, `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. The exact pairs printed depend on the inputs provided during each iteration.
