Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, n, k, and m are assigned the values from input split into a tuple.**

In this state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code. The variables `n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned the values from the input split into a tuple, and the string `s` remains as it was defined in the initial state.
