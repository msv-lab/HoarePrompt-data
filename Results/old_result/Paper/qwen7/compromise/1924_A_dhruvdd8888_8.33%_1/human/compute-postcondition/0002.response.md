Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is now the input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The code creates a set `us` that contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets (i.e., 'a', 'b', ..., up to the `k`-th letter). The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and the string `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
