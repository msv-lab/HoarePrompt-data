Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 26\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 26\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).
- The string `s` is an input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `win` is a set containing some of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets depending on the content of `s`.
- `ans` is a list of characters where each character is added when `win` contains exactly `k` elements.
- `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `ans` was appended, which is also the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` elements.
- `ps` is less than `n`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of any other variables or objects.

Output: **NO**
