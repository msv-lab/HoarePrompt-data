Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the necessary parameters including the permutation `p`, the array `a`, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha.

2. **Index Adjustment**: The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to match zero-based indexing.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible scores for both Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns. It iterates through each turn, updating the positions and scores accordingly. The key logic here is to calculate the maximum score for each player considering their possible moves.

4. **Output Determination**: After calculating the maximum scores, the program compares them and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the winner for each test case. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
