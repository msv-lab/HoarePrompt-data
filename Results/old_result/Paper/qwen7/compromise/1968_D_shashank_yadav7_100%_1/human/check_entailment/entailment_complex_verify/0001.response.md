### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (starting positions for Bodya and Sasha).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 because array indices start from 0.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`sp`) and Sasha (`bp`) are set to the values at their starting positions.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are initialized to the initial scores multiplied by `k`.

4. **Game Loop:**
   - The loop runs for `k` iterations.
   - In each iteration:
     - The positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated to their new positions based on the permutation `p`.
     - The scores are updated accordingly.
     - The maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha are updated using the new positions and scores.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`).
   - It prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if they are equal.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initial scores are correctly set to the values at the starting positions.
   - The maximum possible scores are correctly initialized to the initial scores multiplied by `k`.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop correctly updates the positions and scores for each turn.
   - The maximum possible scores are updated correctly to account for the best possible outcomes for each player.

3. **Final Comparison:**
   - The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` is correct and determines the winner.

### Edge Cases

- **Single Turn (`k=1`):** The program handles this correctly by comparing the initial scores directly.
- **Multiple Turns:** The program correctly simulates the game for multiple turns and updates the scores and positions accordingly.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Possible Scores:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm`. Instead of considering the best possible outcomes for each player, it only considers the current positions and scores without accounting for the possibility of moving back and forth between positions.

2. **Infinite Loops:**
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations, which is unnecessary. The game only lasts for `k` turns, so the loop should run for `k` iterations, not `n` iterations.

### Corrected Version

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for _ in range(k):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment was incorrect because the program does not correctly simulate the game for multiple turns. The corrected version ensures that the loop runs for `k` iterations and correctly calculates the maximum possible scores for each player.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
