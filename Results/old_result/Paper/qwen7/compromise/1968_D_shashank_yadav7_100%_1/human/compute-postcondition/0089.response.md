Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 2`.

3. **Determine the new state of `i` for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since only the loop head variable `i` can be adjusted, we update `i` to `i_prev + 3`.

5. **Other variables**: The other variables (`k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`, `i` is `i_prev + 3`**
