State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
- The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the integer input provided by the user.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- The variables `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are those involving `t` and `i`.
