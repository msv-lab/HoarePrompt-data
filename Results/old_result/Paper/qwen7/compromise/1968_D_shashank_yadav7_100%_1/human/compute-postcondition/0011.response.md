Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is not explicitly given its value, but it is used in the `range(n)` function.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the required states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - The values of `t`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are not directly related to the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted are those involving `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
