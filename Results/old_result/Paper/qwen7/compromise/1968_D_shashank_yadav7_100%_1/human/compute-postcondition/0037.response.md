Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, and `b` is `p[b] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `p[b] - 1`. The values of `i` and `k` are updated according to their initial conditions. `i` remains 1, and `k` is decreased by 1. The state of `p` is not specified, so it remains unchanged.
