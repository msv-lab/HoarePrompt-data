Output State: **`k` is an integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and either `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` is less than or equal to `sm` after the if-else block executes.**

Explanation: The line `s -= 1` decrements the value of `s` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions regarding `bm` and `sm` also remain valid after this operation.
