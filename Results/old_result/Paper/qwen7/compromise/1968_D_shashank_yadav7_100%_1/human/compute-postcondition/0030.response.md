Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1 - 1, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp` + `a[s]`, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b]` - 1, and `sm` is updated to be the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * (k - 1) + sp`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * (k - 1) + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
