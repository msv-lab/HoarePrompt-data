Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decremented by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. Since the values of `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp` are not specified, we keep them as they are. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `p[b]`, `s`, `bm`, and `a[b]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
