Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged.
