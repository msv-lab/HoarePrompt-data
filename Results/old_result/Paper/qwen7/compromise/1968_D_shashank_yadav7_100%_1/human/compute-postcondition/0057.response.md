Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`. The loop condition is `i < t`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `k` is 0
   - `b` is `p[b] - 2^(n-1)`
   - `s` is `p[s] - 2^(n-1)`
   - `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations
   - `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` added `n` times to `sp`
   - `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` added `n` times to `bp`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `n` must be less than `t`.
   - The values of `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes `n`.
   - `t` must remain the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - All other variables (`k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 2^(n-1)`, `s` is `p[s] - 2^(n-1)`, `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` added `n` times to `sp`, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` added `n` times to `bp`, and `t` must be greater than `n`**.
