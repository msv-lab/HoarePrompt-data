Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` (new value is `sp + a[s]`), `k` is decreased by 1 (new value is `k - 1`), and `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `bp` is updated by adding `a[b]` to its current value.**

This means that the value of `bp` has been incremented by `a[b]`. All other variables remain in their respective states from the initial conditions, with the exception of `bp` which now holds the new value.
