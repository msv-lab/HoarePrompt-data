Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `i` is `i_prev + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we have exited the innermost loop or conditional block without further changes to the variables. All other variables retain their previously calculated or assigned values.
