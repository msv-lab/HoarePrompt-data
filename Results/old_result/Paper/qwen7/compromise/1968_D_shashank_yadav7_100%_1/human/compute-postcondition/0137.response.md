Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is -1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `p[b]` is decremented by 1
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`
   - `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`
   - `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).
   - Since `i` was -1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 0 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the loop.
   - `p[b]` is decremented by 1, so it will be `p[b] - 1`.
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`, so it will remain the same unless the value of `p[s]` changes, but since no such change is mentioned, `s` stays the same.
   - `sm` is updated based on the current values of `a[s]`, `k`, `sp`, and `a[s]`, so it will remain the same unless the values of these variables change.
   - `bm` is updated based on the current values of `a[b]`, `k`, `bp`, and `a[b]`, so it will remain the same unless the values of these variables change.
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, so it will be `bp + a[b]`.

5. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is still a positive integer
   - `p[b]` is `p[b] - 1`
   - `s` is the same as before
   - `sm` is the same as before
   - `bm` is the same as before
   - `bp` is `bp + a[b]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the same as before, `sm` is the same as before, `bm` is the same as before, `bp` is `bp + a[b]***
