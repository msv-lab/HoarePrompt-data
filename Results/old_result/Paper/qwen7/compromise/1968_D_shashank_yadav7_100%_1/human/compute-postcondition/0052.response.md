Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is 0
- `b` is `p[b] - 2^(n-1)`
- `s` is `p[s] - 2^(n-1)`
- `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations
- `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` added `n` times to `sp`
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` added `n` times to `bp`
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`

The print statement is simply `print('Draw')`.

Given this, the output will be a string "Draw" because the print statement directly outputs the string literal provided.

Output: **Draw**
