The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The previous values of `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `t`, `n`, and `p` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` added `n` times to `sp`, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` added `n` times to `bp`, `t` must be greater than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**
