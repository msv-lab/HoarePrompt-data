Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, and it is guaranteed to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) retain their initial conditions as specified in the precondition.
