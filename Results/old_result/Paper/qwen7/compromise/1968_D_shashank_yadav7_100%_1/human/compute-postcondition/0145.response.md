Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Here, `s` is defined as `p[s] - 1`, and `sp` is not defined, so it is assumed to be a variable that holds a specific value or is part of the expression. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
