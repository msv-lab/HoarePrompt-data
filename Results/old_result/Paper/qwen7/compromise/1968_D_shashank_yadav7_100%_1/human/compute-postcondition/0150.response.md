Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement has been executed, which exits the loop or if statement it is within. All the changes to the variables before the `break` statement are preserved, and no further changes occur due to the `break`.
