Output State: **`k` is an integer, `b` is `int(input())`, `s` is `int(input())`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and either `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` is less than or equal to `sm` after the if-else block executes.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `p`. The values of `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `i`, and the conditions related to `bm` and `sm` remain unchanged.
