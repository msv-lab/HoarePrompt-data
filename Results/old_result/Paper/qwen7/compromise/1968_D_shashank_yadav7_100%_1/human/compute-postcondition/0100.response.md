Output State: `k` is -`n`, `b` is `p[b] - n`, `s` is `p[s] - n`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`, `i` is `n`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from 0 to `n-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The variable `k` will have been decremented by 1 for each iteration, resulting in `k` being `-n`. The variables `b` and `s` will be updated `n` times based on their respective positions in the list `p`, leading to `b` and `s` being `p[b] - n` and `p[s] - n` respectively. The variables `sp` and `bp` accumulate the sum of `a[s]` and `a[b]` `n` times, resulting in `sp` being `a[s] + n * a[s]` and `bp` being `a[b] + n * a[b]`. The variables `bm` and `sm` will hold the maximum values calculated during the iterations as described.
