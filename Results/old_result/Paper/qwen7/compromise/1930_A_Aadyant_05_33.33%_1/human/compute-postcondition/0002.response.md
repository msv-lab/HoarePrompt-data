Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `numbers` and `range(int(num))`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `numbers` is a variable that will take values from the range defined by `int(num)`.
   - `range(int(num))` defines the range of values that `numbers` will iterate over.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `numbers` is within the range defined by `range(int(num))`.

4. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `num` is the input received from the user.
   - `out` is an empty list.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `numbers` is a variable that will take values from the range defined by `int(num)`, we need to ensure that the loop can start. This means `int(num)` must be a positive integer (since the range function requires a non-negative integer).
   - The initial value of `numbers` will be 0 when the loop starts (as it iterates through the range starting from 0).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `num` and `numbers`.

- `num` must be a positive integer because `range(int(num))` requires a non-negative integer.
- `numbers` must be 0 because the loop starts iterating from 0.

Given this, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is a positive integer, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0**.
