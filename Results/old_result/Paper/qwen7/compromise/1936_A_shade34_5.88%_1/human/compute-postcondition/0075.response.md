Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `mak` is 2

We need to determine the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` to understand what will be printed. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the `pans` list. Since no additional information about `pans` is given, we cannot determine the exact values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

Given this, the output will include placeholders for these unknown values.

Output: **'? [pans[2]] [pans[2]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]]'**
