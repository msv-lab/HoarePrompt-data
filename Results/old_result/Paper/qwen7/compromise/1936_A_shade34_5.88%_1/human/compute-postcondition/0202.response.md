Output State: **`pans` is an empty list, `i` is less than `n`, `mak` is equal to `i`, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is the string "<", and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
