Output State: `i` is 4 and `mak` is 3.

Explanation: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(pans))`. Given that `pans` initially contains all integers from 0 to `n-2` inclusive, its length is `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i = n-2`. Since the loop has executed 3 times, `i` has incremented from 1 to 3. If the condition `str(input()) == '>'` was met each time, `mak` would also increment accordingly, ending at 3. If the condition was not met, `mak` would remain at 1 after the first iteration, but since the problem states that `mak` is 3 after 3 iterations, it implies that the condition was met each time. Thus, after all iterations, `i` will be 4 (since the loop increments `i` from 1 to 3) and `mak` will be 3.
