Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(pans))`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `len(pans)`
   - `mak` is equal to `i`
   - The input equals '>'
   - The input has been read

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `mak` will also be incremented by 1 (since `mak` is equal to `i`).
   - The input remains '>'.
   - The input has already been read, so no change is needed here.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `mak` will be `mak + 1`.
   - The input remains '>'.
   - The input has already been read, so no change is needed here.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is less than `len(pans)` and equal to `mak + 1`, `mak` is equal to `i + 1`, the input equals '>', and the input has been read.**
