Output State: **`i` is `mak + 2`, `n` is `n - 2` and must be greater than or equal to `mak + 3`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n - 1`, and `mak` is `i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only ensures that all previously written output is flushed to the standard output. Since no variables are modified by this line of code, the initial state remains unchanged.
