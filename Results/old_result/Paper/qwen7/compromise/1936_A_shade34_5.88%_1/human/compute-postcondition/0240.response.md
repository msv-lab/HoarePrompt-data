Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range of values it takes, which is from 1 to `len(pans)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `len(pans)`
   - `mak` is equal to `i`
   - The input equals '>'
   - The input has been read

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - `mak` will be updated to the new value of `i`.
   - The input remains '>'.
   - The input has already been read, so no change is needed here.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously less than `len(pans)`, it will now be `i + 1`.
   - `mak` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - The input remains '>'.
   - The input has already been read, so this state remains unchanged.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is less than `len(pans)`, `mak` is equal to `i + 1`, the input equals '>', and the input has been read.**
