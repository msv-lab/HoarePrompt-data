Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 3, but its exact value is not specified.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are referenced in the print statement.
- Since `i` is explicitly given as 1, `pans[i]` is equivalent to `pans[1]`.
- The value of `mak` is not provided, so it remains as `mak`.

Given the information, the print statement will output a string with the placeholder `?` followed by the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.

Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]'**
