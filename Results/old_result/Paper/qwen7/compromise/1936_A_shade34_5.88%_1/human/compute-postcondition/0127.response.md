Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the element `k + 1`, and the new string `s` is either equal to '<' or '='.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or create any new variables. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending buffered data is written to the standard output. However, since no variables are modified by this operation, the values of the existing variables remain unchanged.
