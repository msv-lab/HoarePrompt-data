Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2, 3, or 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `s` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration.
   - If `s` is '<', `pans` contains `[i-1]` and `mak` is equal to `i-1`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged and `s` is the new input string from the user.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

Given the conditions:
- Since `i` can only be 2, 3, or 4, let's consider the possible values for `mak` and `mak2`:
  - If `s` was '<' in the previous iteration, then `mak` would be `i-1` and `pans` would contain `[i-1]`.
  - If `s` was not '<' in the previous iteration, then `pans` would remain unchanged and `s` would be the new input string from the user, but this does not affect the current print statement directly.

However, the variable `mak2` is not defined in the initial state, and it is not clear how it is supposed to be initialized or updated. Given the lack of information about `mak2`, we can assume it might be a typo or an uninitialized variable. For the sake of the print statement, we will assume `mak2` is the same as `mak`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `mak` (which is `i-1` if `s` was '<' in the previous iteration, otherwise it is undefined)
- `mak2` (same as `mak`)
- `i` (which is 2, 3, or 4)
- `mak2` (same as `mak`)

Since `mak2` is assumed to be the same as `mak`, the print statement simplifies to:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `mak` (which is `i-1` if `s` was '<' in the previous iteration, otherwise it is undefined)
- `mak` (same as above)
- `i` (which is 2, 3, or 4)
- `mak` (same as above)

Given these assumptions, the output will be:
Output: **'? [i-1] [i-1] i [i-1]** (where `i` is 2, 3, or 4, and `mak` is `i-1` if `s` was '<' in the previous iteration, otherwise it is undefined).
