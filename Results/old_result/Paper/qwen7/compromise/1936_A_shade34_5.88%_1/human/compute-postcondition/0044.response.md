Output State: **`i` is 1, 2, or 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing `[i]`, `mak` is equal to `i`.**

The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `i` can be 1, 2, or 3, `pans` will be a list containing `[i]`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `mak` remain unchanged.
