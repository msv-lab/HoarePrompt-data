Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `mak` is 4 (though `mak` is not part of the loop head, it remains unchanged)
   - A string input has been read and its value is less than the character `<`
   - `n` must be greater than 4

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 5.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, so `n` must still be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is as follows:

State: **`i` is 5, `mak` is 4, a string input has been read and its value is less than the character `<`, `n` must be greater than 5**
