Output State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and the input is a string equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak` becomes 2, while `i` remains 2, and the conditions for `n` and the input string remain the same.
