Output State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `mak`, `i`, or `n`. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or their states altered, the initial states remain unchanged.
