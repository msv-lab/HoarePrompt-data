Output State: **`pans` is a list containing the element `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `mak` is equal to `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is an input string equal to '=', and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `i` is less than `n`, appending `i` to `pans` results in `pans` being a list containing the element `i`. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `s`, and the number of times `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed remain unchanged.
