Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This suggests that `i` is being assigned the value of `i + 1`. However, since `i` is not explicitly defined before this assignment, we need to consider the context. Typically, such an expression would imply that `i` is being incremented by 1, but without a specific starting value, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` after this operation. For the sake of this problem, let's assume `i` is being incremented by 1 from some unspecified starting value.
- `n` is an input integer: This means `n` is an integer provided as input, but its value is not specified.
- `mak` is `i + 1`: Since `i` is `i + 1`, `mak` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

We know:
- `mak` is `i + 1`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

So, the print statement will output:
- `'?'`: A question mark.
- `mak` (which is `i + 1`).
- `mak` (which is `i + 1`).
- `i` (which is `i + 1`).
- `i` (which is `i + 1`).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? i+1 i+1 i+1 i+1'**
