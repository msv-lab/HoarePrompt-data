Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `mak` is 3

The code snippet is:
```python
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is explicitly given as 3.
- `mak2` is not mentioned in the initial state, but since it is not defined elsewhere in the provided context, we assume it is the same as `mak`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **! 3 3**
