Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list, a new string `s` is assigned the value of the input string which is less than the character '<', and the current value of `s` is equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, we only know that `mak` is now equal to `i`, which was previously `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
