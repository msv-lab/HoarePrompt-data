Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the ticket prices and then determining the optimal way to purchase tickets to minimize the total cost.
2. The logic involves splitting the required number of tickets into blocks, where each block is purchased on a different day, and the cost is adjusted based on the number of tickets bought on previous days.
3. The program correctly handles the scenario where the number of tickets to be purchased (`k`) is exactly divisible by the maximum tickets that can be bought per day (`m`). In this case, it calculates the cost by summing up the costs of the first few days' tickets and adding the penalty for each subsequent day.
4. When the number of tickets is not exactly divisible by `m`, the program correctly identifies the last block of tickets and adjusts the cost accordingly.
5. The program's approach seems to align with the problem statement and examples provided, ensuring that the cost calculation takes into account the price increases due to ticket purchases on previous days.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
