Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4; n, m, and k are undefined; the loop has executed t times, and for each iteration, a cost has been calculated based on the input values of L and M, and printed. The specific values of n, m, and k after all iterations depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
