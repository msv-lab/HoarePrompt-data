Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    2 0
    
    15 0
    
    8 2
    
    0 9

Note

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
import math

func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration `k` from `0` to `ap-1`, the output is calculated based on the input values `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are positive, the output is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`. If `x` is zero and `y` is positive, the output is `math.ceil(y / 2)`. If `x` is positive and `y` is zero, the output is `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If both `x` and `y` are non-positive, the output is `0`.
