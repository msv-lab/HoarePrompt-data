Output State: **`preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0; `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the length of `pre`.**

Explanation: The code `preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))` creates a new list `preOne` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0. The initial value is set to 0 using `initial=0`. The values of `s1` and `totalOne` remain unchanged.
