Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `mex` will hold the minimum value among all elements in the list `p`, and `p` will be updated such that each element `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.

In simpler terms, after the loop runs through all test cases (`t` times), the final state of the variables will be:
- `i` will be `-1` since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0` and then stops.
- `mex` will be the smallest value found in the list `p` after processing all elements.
- The list `p` will contain values such that each `p[i]` equals `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.
