Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state of `t` being a positive integer representing the number of test cases is now confirmed, and no other variables have been affected by this code snippet.
