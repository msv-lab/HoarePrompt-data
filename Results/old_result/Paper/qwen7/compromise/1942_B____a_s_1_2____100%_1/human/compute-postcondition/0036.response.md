The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` must be equal to `n`, and `n` is now an input integer, the value of `t` will also be the same input integer. The other variables (`i`, `mex`, `p`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and all elements in the list `p`, `p[1]` is `mex - a[1]`, `a` remains unchanged, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.**
