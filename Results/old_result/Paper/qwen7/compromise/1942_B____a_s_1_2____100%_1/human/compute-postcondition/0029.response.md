Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `0`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `t - 2`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `t - 3`.
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust other variables**:
   - **Variable `mex`**: The value of `mex` does not change within the loop itself; it is only updated when `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`. Since the loop is about to start again, `mex` retains its value from the previous iteration.
   - **Variable `p[i]`**: The value of `p[i]` changes to `mex - a[i]` during the loop execution, but since the loop is about to start again, `p[i]` retains its value from the previous iteration.
   - **List `a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged as well.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` must still be at least 2.
   - `i` is now `t - 3`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `mex` retains its value from the previous iteration.
   - `p[i]` retains its value from the previous iteration.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is `t - 3`, `n` is the same, `mex` retains its value, `p[i]` retains its value, `a` remains unchanged**.
