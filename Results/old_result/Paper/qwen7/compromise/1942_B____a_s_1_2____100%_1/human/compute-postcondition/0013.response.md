Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Since `i` is defined as `n - 3`, and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` before this line, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`. The conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
