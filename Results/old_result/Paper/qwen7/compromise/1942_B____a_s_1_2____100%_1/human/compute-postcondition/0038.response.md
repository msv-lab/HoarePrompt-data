Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and all elements in the list `p`, `p[1]` is `mex - a[1]`, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`, `p` is initialized to a list of -1's of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `p` to a list of `-1` repeated `n` times. This means that the first element of `p` (i.e., `p[0]`) is `-1`, and now `p[1]` is also `-1` because the list was just initialized. All other elements of `p` remain `-1`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `mex`, `a`) are not affected by this line of code.
