Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `0`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`.

After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `0` because the loop starts from `n-1` and decrements by `1` until it reaches `0`. At this point, the loop condition `i >= 0` will no longer be satisfied, and the loop terminates. The variable `mex` will be updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[0]` on the last iteration, and `p[0]` will be `mex - a[0]`. All other variables' states remain as they were initially or as updated during the loop, with no further changes.
