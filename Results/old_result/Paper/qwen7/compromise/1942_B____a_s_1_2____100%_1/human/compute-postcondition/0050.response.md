Output State: `i` is `0`; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex` and all elements in the list `p` after all iterations of the loop; `p` is updated such that each element `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have reached `0` (since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0`). The variable `mex` will hold the minimum value between its initial value and all the values of `p[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Each element in the list `p` will be updated to be `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.
