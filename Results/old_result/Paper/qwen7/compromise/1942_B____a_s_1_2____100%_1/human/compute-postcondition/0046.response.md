Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `mex` is the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.
   - `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `n-3`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n-3`.
   - `mex` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified within the loop head.
   - `p[i]` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified within the loop head.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be `n-3`.
   - `mex` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `p[i]` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n-3`, `mex` is the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**.
