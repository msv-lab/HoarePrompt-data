Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter t, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: n, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a, a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function does not return a specific value but processes the input according to the given constraints and performs operations on the list a for each test case.**
