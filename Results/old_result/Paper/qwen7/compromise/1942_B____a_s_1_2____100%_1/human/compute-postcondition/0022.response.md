Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t - 1`, `mex` is `n`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `mex` to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
