Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t - 1`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a list of integers from the user input using `input().split()` and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This list is then assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `mex`, and `p[i]` remain unchanged from their previous states. The new state includes the list `a` which contains the integers input by the user.
