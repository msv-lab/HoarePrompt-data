Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads `n` and the list `a` for each test case, which matches the problem statement.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `p` with `-1` for each index, and sets `mex` to `n`. This ensures that initially, `mex` is greater than any possible value in `p`.

3. **Backward Iteration**: The program iterates backward through the list `a` using a for loop. For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This step is crucial because it ensures that `p[i]` is set to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray `p[0...i]`.

4. **Output**: After updating `p` for each index, the program prints the list `p`. Given the constraints and the nature of the MEX operation, this approach guarantees that each `p[i]` is a valid permutation of integers from `0` to `n-1`.

5. **Guaranteed Validity**: Since the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists for the given input, and the algorithm constructs `p` based on the MEX values, the generated permutation `p` will always satisfy the condition `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, including when `a_i` is negative or when `a_i` is already a valid index in `p`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate a valid permutation `p` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
