### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly constructs a permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) of the permutation and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a list `p` of size \( n \) with all elements set to `-1`.
   - It also initializes `mex` (minimum excluded value) to \( n \).

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The loop runs from \( n-1 \) to \( 0 \). For each index \( i \):
     - It sets \( p[i] \) to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
     - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned value of \( p[i] \).

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the constructed permutation \( p \).

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The goal is to ensure that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
  - By setting \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \), the program ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied.
  - However, the approach used in the program is flawed. Specifically, the loop should run from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) to ensure that each position in the permutation is filled correctly.

- **Handling of `mex`:**
  - The `mex` value is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned value of \( p[i] \). This ensures that the smallest unused value is correctly tracked.
  - However, the loop direction is incorrect. The loop should start from \( 0 \) and go to \( n-1 \) to ensure that each position in the permutation is filled correctly.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle the case where the `mex` value might be less than \( 0 \) due to the incorrect loop direction. This can lead to invalid permutations.

### Example:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

- The expected output is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- However, the program's current implementation will produce an incorrect permutation because the loop runs in reverse.

### Corrected Implementation:

To fix the issue, we need to change the loop direction to run from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \):

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is correct. The program's current implementation has a logical flaw due to the incorrect loop direction, which can lead to invalid permutations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
