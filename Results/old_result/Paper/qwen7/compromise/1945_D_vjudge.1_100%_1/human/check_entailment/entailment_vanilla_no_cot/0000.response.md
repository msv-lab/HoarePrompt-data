Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`, which represent the costs associated with moving past a person and the additional costs for each intermediate person.
3. **Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - A new list `c` is created where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
   - A suffix sum array `suff` is computed, where `suff[i]` represents the sum of the minimum costs from index `i` to the end of the list `c`.
   - For each position `i` up to `k-1`, the cost of moving Kirill to position `i` is calculated as `a[i] + suff[i+1]`, and the minimum of these costs is stored in `ans`.

This approach ensures that the program efficiently calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem statement and constraints.
