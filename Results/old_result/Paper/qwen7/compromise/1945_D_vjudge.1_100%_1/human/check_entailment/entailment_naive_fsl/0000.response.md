Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the cost `a_i` for the current position is greater than the total accumulated cost from the previous positions. Specifically, the program only considers the minimum cost between `a_i` and `b_i` for each position, but it does not ensure that the accumulated cost is minimized throughout the process. 

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

- For the first person (`i=1`), the cost is `a_1 = 7`.
- For the second person (`i=2`), the cost is `a_2 = 3`, but considering the accumulated cost from the first person, the effective cost would be `min(7, 4) + 3 = 7`.
- For the third person (`i=3`), the cost is `a_3 = 6`, but considering the accumulated cost from the first two persons, the effective cost would be `min(7, 7) + 6 = 13`.

However, the correct approach should be to accumulate the minimum cost up to the current position and then add the current cost. The program does not do this, leading to an incorrect result. The correct minimum cost for this input should be `14`, but the program outputs `7`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the accumulation of costs, making it incorrect.
