Output State: **`ans` is `float('inf')`, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` in the range `n`; `suff` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the lists `c` and `suff`, which retain their original values and structure. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the initial state of `c` and `suff`.
