Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be positive, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `Min` to be the minimum value between `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` to be the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k`. Since `n` must be non-zero and `k` must be positive, these conditions are preserved. The values of `Min` and `Max` are calculated based on the given values of `n` and `k`.
