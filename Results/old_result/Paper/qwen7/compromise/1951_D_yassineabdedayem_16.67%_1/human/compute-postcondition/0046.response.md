To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic behind the variables:

1. **t**: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. **n**: 0 or less.
3. **k**: 0.
4. **rep**: 60.
5. **number**: The last value assigned to `number` before the loop ended. This value depends on the final condition check, which is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`.
6. **tab**: A list containing the string representation of each `number` assigned during the loop's iterations.
7. **Min**: `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
8. **Max**: `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.

Given that `n` is 0 or less and `k` is 0, the expressions `n // k` and `int(n / k)` are undefined because division by zero is not allowed. However, the problem states that `number` is assigned either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`. Since `k` is 0, both `n // k` and `int(n / k)` are undefined, but the problem implies that the loop ends with a valid assignment.

For the sake of this problem, let's assume the loop logic ensures that `number` is assigned a valid non-zero value (since `n` is 0 or less, and `k` is 0, the only logical value for `number` would be 0 if `n` were negative, but since `k` is 0, it must be handled in a way that avoids division by zero).

Given the loop logic and the conditions, the `number` value will be 0, and `tab` will contain a single element "0" repeated 60 times (since `rep` is 60).

Therefore, `len(tab)` will be 60.

Output: **60**
