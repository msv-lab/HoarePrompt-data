Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is n // k if n // k <= k else k, `Max` is int(n / k) if int(n / k) >= k else k, `number` is Max, `k` is adjusted based on whether Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, `rep` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to k and not zero.**

Explanation: The line `number = Max` assigns the value of `Max` to `number`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `number` is now equal to `Max`, while `total`, `students`, `Min`, `Max`, `k`, `rep`, and `n` retain their original conditions and constraints.
