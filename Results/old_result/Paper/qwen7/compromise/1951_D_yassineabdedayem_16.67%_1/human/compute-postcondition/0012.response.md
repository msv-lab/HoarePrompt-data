Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is an integer read from standard input and `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**
