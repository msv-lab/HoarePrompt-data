Output State: **`Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` based on the condition `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, and `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. The values of `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and the condition for adjusting `k` remain unchanged. The new information added is that `tab` now contains the string representation of `number`.
