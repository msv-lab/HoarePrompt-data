Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `Min` is reassigned to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is reassigned to `max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The line `number = Min` assigns the current value of `Min` to `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` now holds the same value as `Min`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
