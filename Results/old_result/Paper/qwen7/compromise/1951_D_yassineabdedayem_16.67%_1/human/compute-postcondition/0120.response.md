Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

This means that `total` remains 0, `students` is now 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is calculated as the minimum between `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is calculated as the maximum between `int(n / k)` and `k`.
