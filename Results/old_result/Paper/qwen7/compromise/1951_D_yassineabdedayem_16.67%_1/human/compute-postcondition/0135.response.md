Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / (k - Max)), k - Max)`, `number` is `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)`, `k` is `k - Max`, `rep` is 1.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `k` is greater than 0.
- The code updates `k` to `k - Max`, where `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `k`, which is updated to `k - Max`.
- The values of `Min`, `Max`, and `number` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`.
