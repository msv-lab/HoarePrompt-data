Output State: `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is -1, `number` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers determined by the loop over 60 iterations.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 60 iterations (since `rep` is incremented in each iteration and the loop stops when `rep` reaches 60), the following conditions hold:
- `rep` will be 60 because the loop runs until `rep` is no longer less than 60.
- `n` will be 0 because `n` is reduced by `Min * Max` in each iteration, and eventually becomes 0 after 60 iterations.
- `k` will be 0 because `k` is adjusted in each iteration by subtracting either `Min` or `Max`, and it reaches 0 after sufficient iterations.
- `Min` and `Max` will both be 0 because they are recalculated based on the current values of `n` and `k`, which are 0 at the end.
- `i` will be the last element of `tab`, which is a list of strings representing the numbers determined by the loop.
- `t` is -1 because it is decreased by 1 in the initial state and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `number` will be 0 because it is set to either `Min` or `Max`, which become 0 at the end.
- `tab` will contain the string representations of the numbers determined by the loop over 60 iterations.
