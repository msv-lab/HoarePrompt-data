Output State: **`rep` is 0, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `tab` contains the sequence of numbers generated during the loop's execution, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is decreased by 1 (t-1), `number` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `number` to 0. This does not affect the values of `rep`, `k`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `i`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
