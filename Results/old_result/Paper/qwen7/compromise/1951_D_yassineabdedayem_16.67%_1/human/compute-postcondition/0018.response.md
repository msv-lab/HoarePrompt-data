Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 0, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. The values of `t`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
