Let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

We need to ensure that all these conditions are met for the loop to execute at least once.

- The variable `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- The variable `k` is an integer read from standard input.
- The variable `rep` is currently 0.
- The variable `tab` is an empty list.
- The variable `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
- The variable `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.
- The variable `i` is the last element of `tab`.
- The variable `t` is 58.
- The variable `number` is 0.
- The variable `k` is not equal to 0.

To make the loop execute the first time, we need to ensure that:

1. `n != 0`: This condition is already met as long as `n` is not zero.
2. `k > 0`: This condition is already met as long as `k` is not zero.
3. `rep < 60`: Since `rep` is currently 0, this condition is already met.
4. `n >= k`: This is the critical condition that needs to be ensured. We need to make sure that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Since `n` is an integer read from standard input, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than or equal to `k`.

State: **`total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
