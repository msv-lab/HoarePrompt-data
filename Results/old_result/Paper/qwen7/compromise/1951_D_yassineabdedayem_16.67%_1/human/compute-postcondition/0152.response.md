Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is n // k if n // k <= k else k, `Max` is int(n / k) if int(n / k) >= k else k, `number` is either `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, `k` is adjusted to `k - Max` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is adjusted to `k - Min`, `rep` is 2, `n` is n - Min * Max, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
