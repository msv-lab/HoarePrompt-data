Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `students` is 2 less than its initial value (which is not explicitly given, but we know it's 2 less).
- `Min` and `Max` are determined during the final iteration of a loop, where `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- `number` is either `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.
- `k` is adjusted based on the conditions mentioned.
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` for each iteration.
- `k` is not 0.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
