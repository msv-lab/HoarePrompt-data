Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and `tab` now contains the string representations of all the elements it iterated over. Since the loop printed each element of `tab` separated by a space, `i` will be the last element of `tab`. `t` is decreased by 1 for each iteration, so if the loop ran 3 times, `t` would be `t-3`. `number` remains 0 as it was not affected by the loop.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, `tab` contains all the elements it iterated over, with `i` being the last element printed. `t` has been decreased by 3 from its initial value, and `number` remains 0.
