Output State: **`Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` based on the condition `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` updates the value of `n` by subtracting `Min * Max` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
