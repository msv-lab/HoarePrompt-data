Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 1, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `min(n // k, k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Min` and `Max` are reassigned to `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively.**

Explanation: The line `number = Min` assigns the value of `Min` (which is `min(n // k, k)`) to `number`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `number` is now specifically set to `min(n // k, k)`, and `tab` contains the string representation of this value.
