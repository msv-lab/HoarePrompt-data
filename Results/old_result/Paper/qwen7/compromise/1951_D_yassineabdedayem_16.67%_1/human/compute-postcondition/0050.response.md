Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the first element of `tab`.
- `tab` is the list of remaining elements from `tab`.

The print statement `print(i, end=' ')` will print the value of `i` followed by a space, since `end=' '` specifies that a space should be used instead of a newline.

To summarize:
- `i` is the first element of `tab`.
- The print statement will output the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **[value of i] [space]**
