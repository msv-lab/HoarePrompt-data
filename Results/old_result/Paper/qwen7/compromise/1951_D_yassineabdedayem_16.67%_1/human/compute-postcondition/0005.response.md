Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `tab`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, or `number`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
