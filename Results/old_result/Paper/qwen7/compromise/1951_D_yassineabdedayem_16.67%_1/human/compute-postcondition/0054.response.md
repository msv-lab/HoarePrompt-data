Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and has been reduced to 0 or less, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input and has been adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop, `rep` is 60, `number` is the last value assigned to `number` before the loop ended (which would be either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the final condition check), `tab` is a list containing the string representation of each `number` assigned during the loop's iterations, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, and `n` is reduced by `Min * Max` for each iteration until it reaches 0 or less, `k` is not 0**
