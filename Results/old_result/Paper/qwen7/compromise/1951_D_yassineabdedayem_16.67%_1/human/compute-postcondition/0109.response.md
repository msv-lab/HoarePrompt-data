Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `i` will be the last element of `tab`. Since the loop has executed three times, `tab` must have at least three elements. The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will have printed all elements of `tab` in sequence, separated by spaces. The value of `k` remains 0, `rep` is still 60, `Min` and `Max` reflect the values from the last iteration (which is the third iteration in this case), `i` is now the last element of `tab`, `t` is 59 (since it was initialized as 60 and decreased by 1 after each iteration), and `number` is still 0.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be the last element added to `tab`, which means `i` is the third element if `tab` had exactly three elements initially. The loop has printed all elements of `tab` in order. The variable `k` remains 0, `rep` is still 60, `Min` and `Max` are based on the third iteration, `t` is now 59, and `number` is still 0.
