The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to reduce n to 0 by repeatedly subtracting a value derived from n and k, and prints 'YES' along with the number of operations performed if possible, or 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function outputs no further information.
