### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program based on the problem statement and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Statement Recap
- Alice has `n` coins and wants to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, meaning she buys as many jewels as possible from each stall in sequence.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the number of jewels `k`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes variables `rep` (number of stalls), `number` (price per jewel), and `tab` (list of prices).
   - It enters a loop where it tries to satisfy the condition of buying exactly `k` jewels.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It calculates the minimum (`Min`) and maximum (`Max`) possible prices per jewel.
     - If the maximum price equals `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and updates `k`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and updates `k`.
     - It appends the current `number` to the list `tab`.
     - It updates `n` and increments the stall count `rep`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `k` is zero:
     - If `k` is zero, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the list of prices.
     - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

#### Correctness Check
1. **Greedy Approach:**
   - The program uses a greedy approach to assign prices to stalls. However, the logic for determining `Min` and `Max` might not always lead to the correct solution.
   - Specifically, the condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:` seems flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the scenario where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels across multiple stalls.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is very small compared to `k` or vice versa.
   - It assumes that Alice will always buy the maximum possible jewels from each stall, which might not be optimal.

3. **Correct Solution Approach:**
   - A more accurate approach would involve dynamically adjusting the prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - One possible solution is to use binary search or dynamic programming to find the correct prices for each stall.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers: `t`, `n`, and `k`.
- For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to reduce `n` to 0 by repeatedly subtracting a value derived from `n` and `k`, and prints 'YES' along with the number of operations performed if possible, or 'NO' otherwise.
- After processing all test cases, the function outputs no further information.

#### Conclusion
Upon re-evaluation, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the flawed logic in handling the conditions for assigning prices to stalls. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
