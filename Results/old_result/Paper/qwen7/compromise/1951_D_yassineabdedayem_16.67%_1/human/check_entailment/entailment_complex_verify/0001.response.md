### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the key points and verify them:

1. **Greedy Approach Flaw:**
   - The logic for determining `Min` and `Max` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:` is problematic. This condition does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels across multiple stalls. Instead, it might lead to incorrect price assignments.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases effectively, such as when `n` is very small compared to `k` or vice versa. This could lead to incorrect results or infinite loops.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment of Prices:**
   - The program assumes that Alice will always buy the maximum possible jewels from each stall, which might not be the optimal strategy. A more accurate approach would involve dynamically adjusting the prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Binary Search or Dynamic Programming:**
   - A more robust solution would involve using techniques like binary search or dynamic programming to find the correct prices for each stall. This would ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in the most efficient manner.

### Detailed Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Example 1:** `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - The program should output "YES" and the number of stalls and corresponding prices.
  - The correct approach would be to set up stalls with prices `[2, 3, 4]`. This way, Alice buys 3 jewels in total:
    - At the first stall, she buys 3 jewels (costing 6 coins).
    - She is left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any more jewels.

- **Example 2:** `n = 6`, `k = 4`
  - The program should output "NO" because it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.

- **Example 3:** `n = 255`, `k = 8`
  - The program should output "YES" and the number of stalls and corresponding prices.
  - The correct approach would be to set up stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`. This way, Alice buys 8 jewels in total:
    - At the first stall, she buys 1 jewel (costing 128 coins).
    - At the second stall, she buys 1 jewel (costing 64 coins).
    - And so on, until she buys 8 jewels in total.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The greedy approach and the specific conditions used in the program are insufficient to handle all edge cases and ensure the correct solution.

**Final: False**
