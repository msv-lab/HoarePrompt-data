Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires setting up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The key points are:
- Alice buys greedily, meaning she buys as many jewels as possible from each stall.
- There are at most 60 stalls.
- Each stall can have a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- We need to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the number of jewels `k`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - It initializes variables `rep` (number of stalls), `number` (price per jewel), and `tab` (list of prices).
   - It enters a loop where it tries to satisfy the condition of buying exactly `k` jewels.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It calculates the minimum (`Min`) and maximum (`Max`) possible prices per jewel.
     - If the maximum price equals `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and updates `k`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and updates `k`.
     - It appends the current `number` to the list `tab`.
     - It updates `n` and increments the stall count `rep`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `k` is zero:
     - If `k` is zero, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the list of prices.
     - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check
1. **Greedy Approach:**
   - The program uses a greedy approach to assign prices to stalls. However, the logic for determining `Min` and `Max` might not always lead to the correct solution.
   - Specifically, the condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:` seems flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the scenario where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels across multiple stalls.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is very small compared to `k` or vice versa.
   - It assumes that Alice will always buy the maximum possible jewels from each stall, which might not be optimal.

3. **Correct Solution Approach:**
   - A more accurate approach would involve dynamically adjusting the prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - One possible solution is to use binary search or dynamic programming to find the correct prices for each stall.

### Conclusion
Given the flaws in the logic and potential edge cases, the provided program is not correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: **False**
