Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the scenario where Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of jewels Alice buys from each stall is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Jewels Bought**: The program attempts to calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall using a while loop and conditions that do not accurately reflect the greedy buying behavior described in the problem. For instance, the condition `(Min, Max) = (min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k))` and subsequent logic for updating `n` and `k` do not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in total.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is very small compared to `k`, the program may not correctly distribute the purchases across the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Potential Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the case where `n = 10` and `k = 3`. The program should be able to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. However, the current logic might not correctly distribute the purchases to achieve this.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific example:
- Input: `n = 10`, `k = 3`
- Expected Output: `YES` followed by the number of stalls and their respective prices.

However, running the provided code with these inputs does not yield the correct result. The program either fails to set up the stalls correctly or does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
