Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of coins (`n`) and the number of jewels (`k`) that Bob wants Alice to buy.
2. The program then enters a loop to process each test case. It attempts to find a sequence of operations where Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using at most 60 stalls.
3. Inside the loop, the program calculates the minimum and maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from the current stall without exceeding the remaining coins (`n`). It then updates the number of jewels Alice needs to buy (`k`) and the remaining coins (`n`).
4. If `k` becomes zero, it means Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls used and the prices for those stalls.
5. If `k` is not zero after the loop, it means it's impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "NO".
6. The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the number of stalls does not exceed 60 and that the prices are within the specified range.
7. The logic for determining the number of jewels to buy from each stall is sound, as it ensures that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall before moving to the next one.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
