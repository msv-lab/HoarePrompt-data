The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer less than the length of the list `l`), `k` (a non-negative integer), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`). After swapping the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`, it returns the modified list `l`.
