You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    112 777
    
    5 12

    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l

#Function 3:
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)

#Function 5:
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return

#Function 6:
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 6 : The function accepts no parameters and returns either `None` or the value of `l`, which is the result of calling `func_5(l)` with the input `l` that itself is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, where `n` and `k` are both the results of calling `func_4()`. If `n` is 0, the function prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it proceeds to compute `l` and then returns its value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_4()**: This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \). It returns \( (0, 0) \) if \( k \) is odd or if \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - **func_1()**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the required Manhattan value. It uses a recursive approach with helper functions `func_2()` and `func_3()`.
   - **func_2()** and **func_3()**: These functions swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5()**: This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - **func_6()**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4()` and `func_1()`, and then calls `func_5()` to print the result.

3. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - **func_4()**: Ensures \( k \) is even and within the valid range. If \( k \) is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns invalid values.
   - **func_1()**: Constructs the permutation by recursively swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The logic seems to handle even and odd \( n \) correctly.
   - **func_2()** and **func_3()**: Swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value, ensuring the permutation remains valid.
   - **func_5()**: Correctly prints the permutation if found.
   - **func_6()**: Properly handles the input and calls the necessary functions to solve the problem.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like odd \( k \), odd \( n \), and when \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - The recursive approach in `func_1()` ensures that the permutation is built correctly by adjusting the Manhattan value through swaps.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists.
