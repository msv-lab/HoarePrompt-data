Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a while loop to process each one.
2. It reads the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` for each test case and then processes `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`.
3. The variable `num` is used to count the number of moves where the row index equals the column index. This is correctly incremented by 1 for each such move.
4. For moves where `r_i` is not equal to `c_i`, the variable `num` is incremented by 2, as both a white and a black rook are placed.
5. The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.
6. The program then uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions. The base cases and transitions are correctly implemented, and the results are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the logic and the implementation details, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
