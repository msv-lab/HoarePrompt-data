Output State: **`t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is 0, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list containing elements 0, 1, 5, 14, and `dp[5]` is (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7).**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i]` where `i` is 5. According to the formula, `dp[5]` is calculated as `(dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given the initial values of `dp`, `dp[4]` is 14, `dp[3]` is 5, and `dp[2]` is 5. So, `dp[5]` becomes `(14 + 4 * 5 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (14 + 40) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 54 % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 54`. All other variables remain unchanged.
