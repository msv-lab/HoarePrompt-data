Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input**.

The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `c` and `r` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and the initial value of `c` and `r` remain unchanged. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 2 also remains valid.
