Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with 0s, and `m` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
