Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the final value of `k`.
- `k` remains the same as its initial value.
- `c` and `r` are the inputs from the last iteration.
- `num` is `2 * k` if `c` was not equal to `r` in any of the iterations, or `k` if `c` was equal to `r` in all iterations.
- `m` is `n - num`. The current value of `m` is `0`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
