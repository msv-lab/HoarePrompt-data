Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is a value between 0 and `k-1` inclusive, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `num` is the total number of times `c` equals `r` multiplied by 1 plus the total number of times `c` does not equal `r` multiplied by 2.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `num` will hold the sum of points based on the comparison results of `c` and `r` for each iteration. Specifically, for each pair where `c` equals `r`, `num` increases by 1, and for each pair where `c` does not equal `r`, `num` increases by 2. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
