Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, and `m` is `n - num`.**

Explanation: The code `m = n - num` assigns the value of `n - num` to `m`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `num` remains the same as it was calculated before the assignment to `m`. Therefore, `m` is now the difference between `n` and `num`.
