Postcondition: `t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given, `i` is either `-1` or `6` depending on whether `m` equals 0 or not, `m` is either `0` or at least `5`, and `dp` is a list containing elements 0, 1, 5, 14, and the sixth element `dp[5]` is 41.
