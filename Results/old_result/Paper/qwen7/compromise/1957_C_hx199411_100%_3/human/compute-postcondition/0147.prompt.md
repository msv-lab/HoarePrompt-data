Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(1)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the final value of `k`, `k` remains the same as its initial value, `c` and `r` are the inputs from the last iteration, `num` is `2 * k` if `c` was not equal to `r` in any of the iterations, or `k` if `c` was equal to `r` in all iterations, and `m` is `0` if `m == 0` in the if part, or `m` is either `1` or a positive integer, `dp[3]` is `8`, `dp[4]` is `14`, `dp[5]` is `20`, `dp[6]` is `30` in the else part.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `m + 1`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, and either `m` is 0, in which case `dp` is a list of length 1 filled with 1, or `m` is not 0, in which case `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with 0s, with `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given, `i` is either `-1` or `6` depending on whether `m` equals 0 or not, `m` is either `0` or at least `5`, and `dp` is a list containing elements 0, 1, 5, 14, and the sixth element `dp[5]` is 41.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
