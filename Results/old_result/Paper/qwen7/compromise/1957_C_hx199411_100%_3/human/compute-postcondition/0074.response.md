Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `num` is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, which will be `2 * (k - count_of_times_c_equals_r) + count_of_times_c_equals_r`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `num` will be the sum of 1 for each time `c` equals `r` and 2 for each time `c` does not equal `r`. The value of `i` will be `k-1` since the loop runs from `0` to `k-1`. The variables `c` and `r` will hold the last pair of integers input during the loop's final iteration.
