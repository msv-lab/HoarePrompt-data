State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.
2. For the loop to execute, `k` must be a positive integer because the `range(k)` function will generate a sequence from 0 to `k-1`, and if `k` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(k)` generates a sequence starting from 0.
4. The variable `t` and `n` are not directly related to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it must be 0).
