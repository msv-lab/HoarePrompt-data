Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `k`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < k`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `i` must be 0
   - `c` is an input integer
   - `r` is an input integer
   - `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < k`, after one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.
   - All other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `r`, `num`) remain the same.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not**
