Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `num` is 3**.

Explanation: The initial value of `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, and `r` is an input integer. The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Since `num` was initially 1 (as derived from the context that `c` and `r` are inputs and the increment is by 2), after executing `num += 2`, `num` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged.
