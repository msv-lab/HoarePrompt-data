Postcondition: `t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given, `i` is 6, `m` is at least 5, and `dp` is a list containing elements 0, 1, 5, 14, and the sixth element `dp[5]` is 41.

**Explanation:**
- If `m == 1`, then `m` is set to 1, and the loop does not execute. As a result, `i` remains -1, which contradicts the given output state where `i` is 6. Therefore, this case is not possible under the given conditions.
- If `m != 1`, the loop will execute, incrementing `i` from -1 to 6, and updating `dp` accordingly. After the loop completes, `i` will be 6, and `dp` will contain the values [0, 1, 5, 14, 41] up to `dp[5]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
