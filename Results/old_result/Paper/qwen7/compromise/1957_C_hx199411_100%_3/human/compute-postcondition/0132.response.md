Output State: **`t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is 0, `i` is -1, `m` is `n - num`, and `dp` is a list containing elements 0 and 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `dp[1]` to 1. This updates the list `dp` which initially contained a single element 0 to now contain elements 0 and 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
