t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each move you made are valid, meaning they do not attack any rook already placed and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
