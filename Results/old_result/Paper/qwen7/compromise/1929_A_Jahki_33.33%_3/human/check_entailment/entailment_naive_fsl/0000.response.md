Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the main logic for calculating the maximum beauty should focus on rearranging the elements to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Here's a counterexample:

- Input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
2
```

- Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this case, the program sorts the array `[2, 1, 3]` to `[1, 2, 3]` and calculates the beauty as `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`. However, the program incorrectly returns `0` because it checks if the array is already sorted and returns `0` if it is, which is not the correct approach.

To fix this, the program should sort the array and then calculate the beauty by ensuring the largest difference is used first. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version directly calculates the maximum beauty without the unnecessary `func_1` check.
