You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `a` and returns `True` if there are no adjacent pairs in the list where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements as a string `case`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - It converts the string `case` into a list of integers `a` using list comprehension and `isdigit()`.

3. **Checking Initial Order:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the initial array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `a` is already sorted, it prints `0` because no rearrangement is needed, and the beauty is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the maximum beauty.

4. **Calculating Maximum Beauty:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing up `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from `1` to `num2 - 1`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem. The logic to check if the array is sorted can be done directly without this function.
   
2. **Sorting and Calculation:**
   - Sorting the array `a` and then calculating the beauty is correct. However, the sorting should be done once, and the calculation should use the sorted array.

3. **Rearranging Elements:**
   - The problem states that Sasha can rearrange the elements in any way to maximize the beauty. Sorting the array ensures that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized, which is the optimal solution.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly identifies if the array is already sorted and prints `0` if so.
- It sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

Given these points, the program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the steps outlined above.
