Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
2. The provided solution attempts to solve this by sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This approach is correct because the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array is achieved when the smallest element is paired with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
3. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that no rearrangement is needed. However, this function is not used in the main logic of the program, which always sorts the array before computing the beauty.
4. The main logic of the program correctly computes the beauty by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.
5. The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct results based on the provided execution summary and problem description.

Correctness: **True**
