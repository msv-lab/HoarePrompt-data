The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. It checks if n equals k. If true, it prints "YES" followed by 1 twice and returns n (or k). If n is less than k, it prints "NO" and returns None. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the sum of n divided by each value in the list [n - k + 1, 1] and stores it in h. If h is less than k, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES", "2", and the values in the list [n - k + 1, 1]. The function returns None in all cases.
