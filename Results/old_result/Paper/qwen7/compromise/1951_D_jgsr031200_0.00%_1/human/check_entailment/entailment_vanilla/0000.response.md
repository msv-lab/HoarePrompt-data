Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is defined but not implemented. The placeholder comment suggests it should handle the logic for determining if Bob can set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not match the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

3. **Current Implementation of `func_1`:**
   - The function checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from these costs. It then checks if the total number of stalls needed (`h`) is less than `k`. If `h < k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls as 2 along with the costs.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Stalls:**
   - The current implementation only considers setting up 2 stalls, which is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The problem allows up to 60 stalls, and the solution needs to consider different configurations of stalls to achieve the exact number of jewels `k`.

2. **Logic for Setting Up Stalls:**
   - The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is incomplete and does not fully address the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the appropriate number of stalls and prices.

3. **Incomplete Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is not fully implemented and does not cover all possible cases as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It fails to handle the necessary conditions and configurations to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the appropriate number of stalls.

**Correctness: **False**
