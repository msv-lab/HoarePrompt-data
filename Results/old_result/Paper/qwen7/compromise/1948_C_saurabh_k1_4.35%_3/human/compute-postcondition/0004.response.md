Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2 * 10^5 and \( n \) is even), and two strings of length \( n \) made up of characters '<' and/or '>'. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is not '<'. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function ensures it processes up to 10^4 test cases, and the total \( n \) across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
