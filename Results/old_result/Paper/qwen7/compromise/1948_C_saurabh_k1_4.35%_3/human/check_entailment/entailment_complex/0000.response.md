Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `func` function only checks if the second last character of the second row's string is not '<'. This is incorrect because the robot needs to follow the arrows and move through the grid to reach the target cell (2, n). Simply checking the second last character does not account for the robot's movement pattern and the direction of arrows throughout the grid.

The correct approach would involve simulating the robot's movement for each test case, following the arrows until the robot reaches the target cell (2, n) or determines that it cannot reach the target.

Correctness: **False**
