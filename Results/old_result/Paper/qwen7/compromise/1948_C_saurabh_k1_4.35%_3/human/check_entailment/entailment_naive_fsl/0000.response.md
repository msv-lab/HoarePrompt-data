Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks only the second-to-last character of the second row (`b[n - 2]`) to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). This check is insufficient because the robot's movement is influenced by both the current and previous cells' arrows.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4
4
>>><
><>>
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs `No` for this case because it only checks the second-to-last character of the second row. The correct path for this case would be:
1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2).
3. Move right to (1, 3).
4. Move left to (1, 2).
5. Move right to (2, 2).
6. Move right to (2, 3).
7. Move right to (2, 4).

Since the program does not account for the robot's ability to backtrack and retrace its steps, it fails to recognize valid paths. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
