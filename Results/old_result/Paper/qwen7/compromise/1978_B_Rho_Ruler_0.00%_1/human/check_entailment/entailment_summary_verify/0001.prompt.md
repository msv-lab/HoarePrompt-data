You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        low = 0
        high = n
        ans = -1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if func_1(mid, a, b, n):
                ans = mid
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        print(ans)

def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. It calculates the value of `ans` as `k * b + (n - k) * a` and returns `True` if `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an appropriate `k` value. The profit calculation involves selling the first `k` buns at a decreasing price from `b` to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: The given code uses binary search to find the optimal `k`. However, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to achieve this purpose. The function `func_1` should calculate the total profit for a given `k` and compare it with the maximum possible profit (`n * max(a, b)`), but the current implementation does not correctly do this.

3. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the profit but does not check if this profit is the maximum possible.
   - The binary search logic in the main part of the code does not correctly update `low` and `high` based on the comparison with the calculated profit.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - We need to correctly implement `func_1` to calculate the profit for a given `k`.
   - The binary search should correctly update `low` and `high` based on whether the current `mid` value results in a higher profit than the maximum possible profit.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
