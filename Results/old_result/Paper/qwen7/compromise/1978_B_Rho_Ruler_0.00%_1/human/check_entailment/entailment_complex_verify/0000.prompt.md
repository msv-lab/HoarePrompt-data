You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the expression `k * b + (n - k) * a` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)` holds true, given that `t` is a positive integer and `ans` is already defined as `k * b + (n - k) * a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. It calculates the value of `ans` as `k * b + (n - k) * a` and returns `True` if `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, otherwise it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Bob's profit. The main issue lies in the binary search approach used in the `func_1` function. The function `func_1` is intended to check if choosing `k` buns at the modified price results in a valid profit calculation, but it does not actually maximize the profit.

Here’s a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
4 4 5
```
- According to the problem description, the optimal choice is to set \( k = 1 \). This means selling the first bun at 5 coins and the remaining 3 buns at 4 coins each.
- The total profit would be \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \) coins.

However, the current implementation of the binary search does not guarantee that \( k = 1 \) is chosen. Instead, it uses a binary search to find a value of \( k \) such that the profit is less than or equal to \( n \times \max(a, b) \), which is not the correct approach to maximize profit.

A correct implementation would directly calculate the profit for different values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n \) and choose the maximum profit. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = k * b + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This version iterates over all possible values of \( k \) and calculates the profit for each, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.
