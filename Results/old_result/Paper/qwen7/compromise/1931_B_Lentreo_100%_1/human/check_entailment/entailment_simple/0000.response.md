Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
2. The key observation is that the sum of the amounts of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. This means that the average amount of water per container is an integer.
3. The provided solution correctly checks if the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
4. If the sum is divisible, it calculates the mean amount of water per container and then iterates through the list to ensure that the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean does not become negative. This check ensures that water can be balanced across all containers.
5. Since the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, the cumulative difference `curr` will always balance out to 0, meaning the loop will not return 'NO' and will correctly return 'YES'.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
