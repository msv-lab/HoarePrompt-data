You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `nums` representing the amounts of water in each container. It checks if the water can be distributed equally among the containers. If the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, calculating the difference between each container's water amount and the average water amount, ensuring the cumulative difference does not become negative. If the cumulative difference remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it returns 'YES', indicating equal distribution is possible; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another where the source container index is less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Since we can only pour water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index, the final amount of water in each container must be the average amount of water per container. This is because any pouring operation can only redistribute the water but cannot change the total amount of water or the average amount of water per container.

3. **Sum Divisibility Check**: Given that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers \(n\), the average amount of water per container is an integer. This means that it is theoretically possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers.

4. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by \(n\).
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by \(n\), it returns 'NO'.
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by \(n\), it calculates the target amount of water per container (`mean`).
   - It then iterates through the containers and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount ever becomes negative. If it does, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution without violating the pouring rule.
   - If no such negative cumulative difference occurs, it returns 'YES'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by \(n\) correctly by returning 'NO'.
   - The code also correctly handles the case where the water can be evenly distributed by ensuring the cumulative difference never goes negative.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same under the given constraints.
