Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` is an input integer, `power` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 5, otherwise `power` is not equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The values of `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, `power`, and the condition on `n` relative to `i` remain unchanged.
