Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state only provides information about the range of `t`, the condition for `n_cases`, the value of `i`, and the definition of `power` based on the value of `n`. However, the `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1, regardless of the values of other variables. Therefore, the output will be **1**.
