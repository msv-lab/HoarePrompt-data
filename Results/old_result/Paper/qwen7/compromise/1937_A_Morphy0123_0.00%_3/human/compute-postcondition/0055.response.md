Output State: **`power` is 7, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, `n` must be greater than 64**

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 6 to 7. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
