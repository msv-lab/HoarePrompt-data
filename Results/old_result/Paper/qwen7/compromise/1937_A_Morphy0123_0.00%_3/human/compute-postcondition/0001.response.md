Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n_cases`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `n_cases` is an input integer, its value is unknown but it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` starts at 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n_cases` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it starts at 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
