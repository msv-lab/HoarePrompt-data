Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two integers, t and n, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It returns a value based on the relationship between t and n.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates or performs some operation based on the values of t and n, but since the specific operation is not detailed, the focus is on the parameters and their constraints.
