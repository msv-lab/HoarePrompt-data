Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. Therefore, the relevant variables are `power` and `n`.

2. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `power` is 1.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` is either 3 or 6.
   - `n` is the integer input from the user.
   - `power` is 4 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n` and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.
   - Since `power` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 1 for the loop to start.

4. **Consider the possible values of `n`**:
   - If `n` is 1, then `power` would be 4 (as per the given conditions).
   - For `power` to remain 5, `n` must be such that `log2(n)` is greater than 1.

5. **Calculate the minimum value of `n` for `log2(n)` to be greater than 1**:
   - `log2(n) > 1` implies \(n > 2\).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes the first time, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final Answer:
State: **`power` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than 2, `power` is 4 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n` and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.**
