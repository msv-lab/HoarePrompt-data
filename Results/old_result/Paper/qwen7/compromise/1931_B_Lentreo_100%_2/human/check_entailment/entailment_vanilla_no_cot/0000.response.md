Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of containers `n`.
   - It reads the list of water amounts `nums` for the containers.
   - It calls the function `func_1(nums)` to check if it's possible to equalize the water amounts.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container (`mean`).
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps a running difference (`curr`) between the current sum and the expected sum if all containers had the `mean` amount.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the equal distribution, so it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means it's possible to equalize the water amounts, so it returns 'YES'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the possibility of making all containers have the same amount of water. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
