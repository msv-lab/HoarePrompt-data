You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):

    if total % n != 0:

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, where the length of nums is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the sum of nums is divisible by n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9).
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `total` is the sum of `nums`. The sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: `curr` is the sum of elements in `nums` each subtracted by `mean`, and either `'NO'` is returned if `curr` becomes less than 0 at any point during the loop iterations or the loop completes without returning anything, meaning `curr` is non-negative after all iterations.
    return 'YES'
    #'YES'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), the target amount of water in each container would be `total / n`, where `total` is the sum of water in all containers.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean becomes negative at any point. If it does, it means we cannot achieve equal distribution without violating the pouring rule (since we would need to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more, which is not allowed).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, returning "NO".
   - The program correctly checks if it's possible to redistribute the water such that no negative difference occurs during the process.

5. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The input handling and loop structure are appropriate for the given constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
