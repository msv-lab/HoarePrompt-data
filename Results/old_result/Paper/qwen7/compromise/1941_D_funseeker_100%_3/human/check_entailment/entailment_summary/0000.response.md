Reasoning:
- The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, reading the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player position `x` for each test case.
- The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case using `func_4()`.
- `func_4()` correctly initializes the set of possible positions for the ball with the initial player position `x`.
- For each throw, it updates the set of possible positions based on whether the throw was clockwise (`0` or `?`) or counterclockwise (`1` or `?`).
- After processing all throws, it adjusts the set to ensure that `0` is replaced with `n` if it exists, and then prints the number of possible positions and their sorted values.
- Given the execution summary and the problem description, the implementation appears to correctly simulate the ball's movement and determine the possible final positions of the ball after all throws.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
