Postcondition: `n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', `temp` is now equal to `(q + r) % n` plus `(q - r) % n`, and the value of `temp` is updated based on whether `c` is '1' or '?' (if `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` remains as `(q + r) % n` plus `(q - r) % n`).
