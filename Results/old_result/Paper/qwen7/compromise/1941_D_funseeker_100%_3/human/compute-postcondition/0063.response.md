Output State: **`ans` now contains all the elements from `temp`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, and `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`; `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The line `temp = set()` creates an empty set named `temp`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `m`, `r`, or `c`. Therefore, the conditions and values associated with these variables remain unchanged, except that `temp` is now an empty set.
