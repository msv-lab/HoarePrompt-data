The function accepts a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` such that 1 <= k <= n. It identifies indices in the list `a` where elements are greater than the `k`-th element of the list. Based on the number of such indices and their positions, it returns one of seven possible values: `n - 1`, `13`, `ind[0] - 1`, `14 - ind[0]`, the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `13`, or the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and either `ind[1] - ind[0]` or `14 - ind[0]`.
