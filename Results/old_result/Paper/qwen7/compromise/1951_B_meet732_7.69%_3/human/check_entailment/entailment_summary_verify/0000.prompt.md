You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if k == 14:
        print(ind)
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` such that 1 <= k <= n. It identifies indices in the list `a` where elements are greater than the `k`-th element of the list. Based on the number of such indices and their positions, it returns one of seven possible values: `n - 1`, `13`, `ind[0] - 1`, `14 - ind[0]`, the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `13`, or the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and either `ind[1] - ind[0]` or `14 - ind[0]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
5 3
5 3 10 8 2
```

The expected output for this case is `2`, because we can swap cow `3` (with rating `10`) with cow `2` (with rating `3`), and then cow `3` will win the first match and the second match. However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. The program identifies the rating of cow `k` and its index.
2. It then tries to find up to two cows with higher ratings than cow `k`.
3. Based on the positions of these cows, it calculates the maximum number of wins.

However, the logic for determining the maximum number of wins is flawed. Specifically, the program does not consider the possibility of swapping cow `k` with a cow that has a lower rating but is strategically placed to allow more wins.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the following steps:
1. Identify the highest-rated cow that is before cow `k` and the highest-rated cow that is after cow `k`.
2. Determine the best position to swap cow `k` to maximize the number of wins.
3. Calculate the number of wins based on the new position of cow `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    before_higher = None
    after_higher = None
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            if i < k:
                before_higher = i
            else:
                after_higher = i
            if before_higher is not None and after_higher is not None:
                break
    if before_higher is None:
        # Cow k is the highest rated, so it can win all matches except the last one
        return n - 1
    if after_higher is None:
        # Cow k is the lowest rated among the ones before it, so it can only win the first match
        return 1
    # Swap cow k with the cow before it if it helps
    if before_higher > after_higher:
        return after_higher
    # Otherwise, keep cow k in its original position
    return before_higher
```

This corrected function should handle all cases correctly and maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.
