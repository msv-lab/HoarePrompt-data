Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]) where ind[0] is the first element of the list ind, and k is 14.**

Given the initial conditions:
- `ind` is a list containing exactly two indices where the elements in `a` are greater than `x`.
- The first element of `ind` is not 0.
- `k` is 14.
- `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.

We need to calculate the maximum value between `(ind[0] - 1)` and `(k - ind[0])`.

Since `ind[0]` is not 0 and `k` is 14, let's denote `ind[0]` as `i`. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value between `(i - 1)` and `(14 - i)`.

For example, if `ind[0]` is 5, then:
- `(i - 1)` would be `5 - 1 = 4`.
- `(14 - i)` would be `14 - 5 = 9`.

Thus, the maximum value between 4 and 9 is 9.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (14 - ind[0]) where ind[0] is the first element of the list ind.**
