Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `x` is the k-th element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the k-th element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The length of the list `a` and the value of `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `x` as well as the unchanged values of `a` and `k`.
