Based on the initial state provided:

- `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, but the specific content of `moves` is not detailed.
- `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes.
- `empty` is False.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
- `t` is 1.
- `edges` remains an empty list.
- `start` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.
- `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.
- There exists at least one move in `moves` that is odd.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Ron')
```

This statement will print the string 'Ron' directly, regardless of the other variables and their states.

Output: **Ron**
