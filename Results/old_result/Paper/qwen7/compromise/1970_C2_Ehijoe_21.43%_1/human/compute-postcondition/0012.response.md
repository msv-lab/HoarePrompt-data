Output State: **`moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes, `empty` is False, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` remains an empty list, `start` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.**

Explanation: The code `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` calls the function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments and assigns the result to the variable `moves`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
