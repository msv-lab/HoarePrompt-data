Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.**

The code creates a `defaultdict` with the default factory set to `list`, which means that when a key is accessed that does not exist in the dictionary, it will automatically create a new list for that key. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
