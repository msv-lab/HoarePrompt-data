Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `moves` is a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made by the players during the game.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `empty`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the same values for all variables except `empty`, which is now explicitly set to `True`.
