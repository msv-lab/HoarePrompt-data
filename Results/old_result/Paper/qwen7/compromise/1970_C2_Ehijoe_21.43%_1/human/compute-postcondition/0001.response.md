Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `moves` is a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made by the players during the game.**

The code initializes `edges` as an empty list, which does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `start`, or `moves`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, while `edges` is explicitly set to an empty list.
