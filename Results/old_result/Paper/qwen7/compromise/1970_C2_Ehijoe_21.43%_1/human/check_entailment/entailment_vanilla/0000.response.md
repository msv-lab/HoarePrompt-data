Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a tree with `n` nodes.
   - There are `t` rounds, but since `t = 1`, we only need to handle one round.
   - In each round, a stone is placed on a specific node, and players take turns moving the stone to an unvisited neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine who wins if both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the distance from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - It uses recursion to traverse the tree.
   - The base case checks if the current node has only one neighbor (itself), returning `[0]`.
   - For each child node, it recursively calculates distances and adds 1 to each distance.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads input values for `n` and `t`.
   - Constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - Identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor).
   - Reads the starting node for the round.
   - Calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - Checks if any of these distances are odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes using a recursive approach.
   - This is essential for determining the optimal moves.

2. **Winning Condition:**
   - The logic in `func_2` to check if any distance is odd is correct.
   - If there exists at least one odd distance, Ron can always force a win because he can always choose a move that leads to an even distance, forcing Hermione into a losing position.
   - Conversely, if all distances are even, Hermione can mirror Ron's moves, ensuring she always has a valid move and thus winning the round.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the single round case correctly.
   - The input format and constraints are respected.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
