def func_1(nodes, start, parent):
    if (len(nodes[start]) == 1 and nodes[start][0] == parent) :

    #State: nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node (integer) and its value is a list of its neighbors (integers), start is an integer representing the starting node, and parent is an optional integer representing the parent node (default is None). The length of the neighbors list of `start` is not 1 or the first element of the neighbors list is not equal to `parent`.
    distances = []
    for node in nodes[start]:
        if node != parent:
            distances.extend([(1 + dist) for dist in func_1(nodes, node, start)])
        
    #State: Output State: `distances` is a list containing tuples of distances from the `start` node to all other nodes in the graph, where each tuple has the form `(distance, node)`, and `parent` remains `None`. Each distance is calculated as the shortest path distance considering the parent node restriction.
    return distances
    #The program returns a list named 'distances', where each element is a tuple containing the shortest path distance from the 'start' node to another node in the graph and the corresponding node itself. The first element of each tuple represents the distance, and the second element represents the node. Additionally, the variable 'parent' remains unchanged (None).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `nodes`, an integer `start`, and an optional integer `parent`. It returns either a list containing the integer 0 or a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the shortest path distance from the `start` node to another node in the graph and the corresponding node itself. The `parent` parameter remains unchanged (None). If the node has only one neighbor which is the `parent`, it returns a list containing 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the shortest path distances for all other nodes and returns these distances as a list of tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v, start is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and moves is a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made by the players during the game.

    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: 'Hermione'
    #State: Postcondition: `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes, `empty` is False, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` remains an empty list, `start` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list. If there exists at least one move in `moves` that is odd, `moves` remains unchanged. Otherwise, all moves in `moves` are even numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs a tree from given nodes and edges, identifies all leaf nodes, and then calls another function `func_1` to determine a sequence of moves starting from a specified node. Based on whether any move in the sequence is odd, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. The final state includes the identified leaf nodes, the unchanged input values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, and `nodes`, and the sequence of moves `moves`.
