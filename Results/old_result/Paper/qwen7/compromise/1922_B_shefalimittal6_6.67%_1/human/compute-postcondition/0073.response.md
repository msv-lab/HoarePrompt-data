Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head involves `cnt` from the `num_of_lens.values()`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are values in `num_of_lens`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **`num_of_lens`**: This dictionary is being iterated over, and it loses one key-value pair per iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `num_of_lens` should have one less key-value pair.
   - **`cnt`**: This variable takes on the value of each key in `num_of_lens` during each iteration. For the next iteration, `cnt` will take on the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - **`res`**: The value of `res` is updated based on the current `cnt` and other conditions. Since the loop is about to execute again, `res` should be in its updated state based on the current `cnt`.
   - **`total_sum`**: This is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. As `cnt` changes, `total_sum` will be recalculated for the next iteration.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `num_of_lens` will have one less key-value pair.
- `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` will be updated based on the new `cnt` and other conditions.
- `total_sum` will be recalculated without the current `cnt`.

Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary and we are iterating over its values, the next `cnt` will be the next value in the sequence of values in `num_of_lens`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt >= 2`) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if the if condition is not met), `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**
