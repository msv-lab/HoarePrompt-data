Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in nums`. This means the loop variable is `x` and the iterable is `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `x`: This variable will take on each value from the list `nums` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `nums`: This is a list of integers entered by the user.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head variables**:
   - Since `x` will take on each value from `nums`, we need to ensure that `nums` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The initial values of `cnt`, `res`, `t`, `n`, and `num_of_lens` do not affect whether the loop can execute, as they are not used in the loop head.

4. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `nums` has at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`cnt`, `res`, `t`, `n`, and `num_of_lens`) do not need to be explicitly adjusted since their values are not relevant to the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`nums` must have at least one element**
