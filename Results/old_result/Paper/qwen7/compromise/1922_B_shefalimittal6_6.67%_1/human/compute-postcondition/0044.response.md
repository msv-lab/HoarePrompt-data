Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is updated to include the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, and the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. This operation does not affect the values of `res`, `t`, `n`, or `total_sum`. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged. The only variable that is directly affected is `num_of_lens`, which is now an empty dictionary.
