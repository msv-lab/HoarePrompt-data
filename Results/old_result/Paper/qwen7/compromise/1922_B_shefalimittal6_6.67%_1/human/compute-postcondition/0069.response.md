Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary excluding the value associated with `cnt`. The `num_of_lens` dictionary loses one key-value pair, `cnt` remains unchanged as the next integer greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The new variable `total_sum` is created and holds the sum of the remaining values in `num_of_lens`.
