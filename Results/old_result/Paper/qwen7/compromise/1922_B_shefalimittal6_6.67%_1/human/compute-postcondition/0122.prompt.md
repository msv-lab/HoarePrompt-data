Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is 0, `num_of_lens` dictionary contains counts of each unique integer from the original `nums` list, `cnt`, `res`, `t`, and `n` retain their values from the final iteration of the loop, and `nums` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` must not be empty, and `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`) if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `res` and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged if `cnt` is less than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and remains unchanged if `cnt` is less than 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`, and `num_of_lens` must not be empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and remains unchanged if `cnt` is less than 2. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`, and `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
