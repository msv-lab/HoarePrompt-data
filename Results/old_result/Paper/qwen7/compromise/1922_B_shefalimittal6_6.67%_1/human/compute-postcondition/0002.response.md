Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains unchanged and is still valid.
