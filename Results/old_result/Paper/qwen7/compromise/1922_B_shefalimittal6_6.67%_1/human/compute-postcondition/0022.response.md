Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by `total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.
