Output State: **`num_of_lens` dictionary is empty, `cnt` is the last integer value from the original `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the sum of applying the given combinatorial operations over all integers in the original `num_of_lens.values()` that met the conditions, `t` is reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The line `num_of_lens = {}` initializes an empty dictionary named `num_of_lens`. This operation does not affect the values of `cnt`, `res`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the dictionary being empty and the other variables retaining their previous values.
