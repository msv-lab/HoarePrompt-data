Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt >= 2`) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if there is no else part, which means the condition `cnt >= 2` is true). `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
