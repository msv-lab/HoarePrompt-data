Output State: **The `num_of_lens` dictionary is empty, `cnt` is the last integer value from the original `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is the sum of applying the given combinatorial operations over all integers in the original `num_of_lens.values()` that met the conditions.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `num_of_lens` will be empty because each iteration removes one key-value pair from it. The variable `cnt` will be the last integer value from the original `num_of_lens.values()`. The variable `res` will be the cumulative result of applying the combinatorial operations (`math.comb(cnt, 3)` or `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`) to each integer in `num_of_lens.values()` that met the specified conditions during each iteration of the loop.
