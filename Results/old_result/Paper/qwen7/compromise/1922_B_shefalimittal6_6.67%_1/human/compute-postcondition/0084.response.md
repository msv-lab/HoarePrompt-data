Output State: **`num_of_lens` dictionary is empty, `cnt` is the last integer value from the original `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the sum of applying the given combinatorial operations over all integers in the original `num_of_lens.values()` that met the conditions, `t` is reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `cnt`, `res`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
