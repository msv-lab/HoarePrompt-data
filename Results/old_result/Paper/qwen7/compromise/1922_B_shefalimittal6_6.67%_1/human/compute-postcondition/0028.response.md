Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Here, `math.comb(cnt, 2)` calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items, which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) / 2`. The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The `cnt` and `total_sum` remain as they were before, but `res` is updated to include the new value.
