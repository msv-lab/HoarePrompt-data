Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

3. **Adjust the Initial State:**
   - Since `t` is initially set to an integer input from the user, we need to ensure that `t` meets the condition for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state given is that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.

Given this information, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
