Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`. This sum is stored in `total_sum`.
- The values of `num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The new variable `total_sum` is introduced and is equal to the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding `cnt`.
