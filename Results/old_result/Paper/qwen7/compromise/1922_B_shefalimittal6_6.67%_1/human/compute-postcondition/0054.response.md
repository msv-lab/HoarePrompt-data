Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The given code snippet initializes the variable `res` to 0. It does not perform any operations that would change the value of `res` or `num_of_lens`. Since the `nums` list is not provided and no operations are performed on `num_of_lens` or `res`, both remain in their initial states. Therefore, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, and `res` is 0.
