Output State: **`nums` must have at least one element; `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the count of the length `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Initially, `num_of_lens[x]` is either already set to some value or defaults to 0 if it hasn't been set before. The code increments this value by 1. The list `nums` and other variables remain unchanged.
