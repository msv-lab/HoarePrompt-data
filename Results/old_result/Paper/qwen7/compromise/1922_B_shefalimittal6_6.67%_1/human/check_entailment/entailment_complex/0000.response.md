Reasoning:
The annotated program seems to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: It uses a dictionary (`num_of_lens`) to count the frequency of each stick length in the current test case.
3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - For each unique stick length (`cnt`), if there are at least 3 sticks of that length, it adds the number of ways to choose 3 sticks (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`) to the result (`res`).
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of that length, it calculates the total number of sticks of other lengths (`total_sum`) and adds the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the current length (`math.comb(cnt, 2)`) multiplied by `total_sum` to the result (`res`).
4. **Output**: The result is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly compute the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles for each test case. There are no apparent logical errors or misinterpretations of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
