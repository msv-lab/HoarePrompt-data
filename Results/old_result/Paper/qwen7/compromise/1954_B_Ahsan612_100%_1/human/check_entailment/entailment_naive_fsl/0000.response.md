Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. The program does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that breaks the beauty condition.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program outputs `1`, but the correct answer should be `1`. Hereâ€™s why:

- The array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is beautiful because you can choose `i = 2` or `i = 3` to replace `a_2` or `a_3` with `a_1` or `a_2` respectively, making the array non-beautiful.
- However, the program only checks the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and outputs that length. In this case, the longest sequence is `1, 2, 1` which has a length of `3`, leading to an incorrect output of `1`.

To fix this, the program needs to properly track and handle the removal of elements in a way that ensures the array stops being beautiful. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
