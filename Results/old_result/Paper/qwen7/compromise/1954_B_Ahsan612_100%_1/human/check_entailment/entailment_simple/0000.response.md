Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func()` attempts to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it non-beautiful.
2. The function iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements.
3. If the array consists entirely of identical elements, the function correctly outputs `-1` since removing any element would still leave the array beautiful.
4. The function correctly identifies the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements that must be removed to break the beauty condition.
5. The logic and flow of the function match the problem statement and constraints provided.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
