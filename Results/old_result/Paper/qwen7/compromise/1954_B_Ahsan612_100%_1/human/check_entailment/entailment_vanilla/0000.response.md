### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence of consecutive identical elements (`same`), the number currently being tracked (`num`), and the minimum length of such sequences (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array, updating these variables as it encounters sequences of identical elements.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic for identifying the minimum length of sequences of identical elements seems correct.
   - The logic for determining if it's possible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements also appears correct.
   - However, there are a few potential issues:
     - The program assumes that the array is already beautiful, which is stated in the problem constraints but should be explicitly checked within the code.
     - The program does not handle the case where the array has only one unique element correctly. In such a case, the array is already non-beautiful, and no removals are needed.

4. **Edge Case Consideration**:
   - If the array consists of a single unique element repeated throughout, the program incorrectly prints `-1`. This is because the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements is the length of the array itself, which triggers the `-1` condition.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but fails to handle the edge case where the array consists of a single unique element. Therefore, the program needs to be adjusted to handle this specific scenario correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
Add a check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where the array has only one unique element:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        # Check if the array has only one unique element
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
        elif minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

This fix ensures that the program handles the edge case correctly.
