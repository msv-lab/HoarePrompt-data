Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `len(ar)`, `num` is equal to `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `same` is incremented by 1, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `same` becomes 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously incremented by 1 and is less than `len(ar)`, after this operation, `i` is still less than `len(ar)`. The conditions related to `num`, `same`, and `minn` remain unchanged because the code does not directly affect these variables. Therefore, the conditions involving `num`, `same`, and `minn` stay the same as they were before the increment operation.
