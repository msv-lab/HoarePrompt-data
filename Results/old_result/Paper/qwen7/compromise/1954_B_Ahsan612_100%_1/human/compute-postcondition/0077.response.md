Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `len(ar)`, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `same`. The variables `i` and `num` remain unchanged from their previous values, with `i` being incremented by 1 and still being less than `len(ar)`, and `num` still being equal to `ar[i]`.
