Output State: **The number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the length of this list minus 1, `same` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 2, and `i` is less than or equal to `n` and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar` to the variable `num`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `i` is less than or equal to `n` and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num` remains valid.
