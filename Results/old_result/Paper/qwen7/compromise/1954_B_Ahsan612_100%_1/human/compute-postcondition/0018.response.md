Postcondition: `same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains infinity.
