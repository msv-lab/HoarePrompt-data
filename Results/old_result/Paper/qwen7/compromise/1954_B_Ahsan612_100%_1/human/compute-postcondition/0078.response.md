Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `len(ar)`, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `same` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i`, `num`, or `minn`. The conditions and values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state, except that `same` is now explicitly set to 1.
