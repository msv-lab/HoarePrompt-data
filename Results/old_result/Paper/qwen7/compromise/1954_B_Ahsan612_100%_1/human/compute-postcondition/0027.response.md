Postcondition: `same` is either 3 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is either 3 or 4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or `ar[4]`, and `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains `same` if `same` is 3, or remains 2 if `same` is 1.
