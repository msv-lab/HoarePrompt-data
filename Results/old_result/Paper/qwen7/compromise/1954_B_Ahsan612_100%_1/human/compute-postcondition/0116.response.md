Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1). Therefore, `minn` is 1.
   - The number of iterations left is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `same` is 2.
   - `i` is now 5.
   - `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `num` is equal to `ar[0]`.
   - `ar[i]` is equal to `num` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `i` is 5, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, the number of iterations left is 0, `same` is 1, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Currently, `i` is 5. To satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`, `i` must be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be incremented by 1 to check if `i` is still less than `len(ar)`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`minn` is 1, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 2, `i` is 6, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`**.
