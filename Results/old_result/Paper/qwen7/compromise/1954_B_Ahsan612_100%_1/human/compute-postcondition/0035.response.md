Postcondition: `same` is either 1, 2, or 4; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is either 4, 5, or 6; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5; `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or `ar[4]` or `ar[5]` or `ar[6]`; `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains `same` if `same` is 4, or remains 2 if `same` is 2, or remains 1 if `same` is 1.
