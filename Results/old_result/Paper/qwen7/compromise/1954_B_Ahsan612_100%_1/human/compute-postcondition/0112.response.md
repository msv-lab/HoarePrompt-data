Output State: **`i` is 5, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, the number of iterations left is 0, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same`. Since `same` is either 2 or 1, `minn` will be updated to the smaller of `minn` and 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
