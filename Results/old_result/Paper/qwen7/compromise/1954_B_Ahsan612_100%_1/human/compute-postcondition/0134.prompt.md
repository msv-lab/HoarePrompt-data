Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `same` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` (or the first element if no other elements match `num`), and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the current `same` value. If `minn` is infinity or equal to the length of the list `ar`, then `minn` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `minn` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the current `same` value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The number of iterations left is 0, `n` is the length of the list `ar` minus 1, `same` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `minn` is either infinity, the length of the list `ar`, or the minimum of `minn` and `same`, unless `minn` is neither infinity nor the length of the list `ar`, in which case `minn` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1, `same` is 1, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to the last element checked before the loop ends. If `minn` is infinity or `minn` is equal to the length of `ar`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `(minn == inf or minn == len(ar))` is false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
