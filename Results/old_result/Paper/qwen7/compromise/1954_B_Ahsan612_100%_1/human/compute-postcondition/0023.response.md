Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[4]` if `ar[4]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains infinity.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[4]` to `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `num` now holds the value of the fifth element in the list `ar`. The condition for `minn` remains the same, but since `num` is now `ar[4]`, `minn` will be `ar[4]` if `ar[4]` equals `num`, otherwise, it remains infinity.
