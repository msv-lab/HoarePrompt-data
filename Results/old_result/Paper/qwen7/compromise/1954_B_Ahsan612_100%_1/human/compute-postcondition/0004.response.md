Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
