Output State: **`minn` is infinity, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `i` is 2, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 1, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
