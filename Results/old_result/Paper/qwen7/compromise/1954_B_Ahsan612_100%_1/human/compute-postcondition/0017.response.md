Postcondition: `same` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar` if `same` is 2, otherwise `num` is `ar[i]`, and `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index `i` (either 1 or 2).
