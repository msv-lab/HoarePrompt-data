To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states:

### Loop Condition:
```
while lst[tmp] != []:
```

### Given States:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `t` is 1
- `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\)
- `x` is an integer from the input
- `y` is an integer from the input
- `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing edges from each node to its neighbors based on user inputs
- `rev` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing reverse edges for each node to its neighbors based on user inputs
- `z` is an integer from the input
- `tmp` is equal to `z`
- `one` is True

### Analysis:
- The loop condition checks if `lst[tmp]` is not empty.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list.

Given that `tmp` is equal to `z`, we need to ensure that `lst[z]` is not an empty list. Since `z` is an integer from the input, there is no guarantee that `lst[z]` is non-empty unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `z` (which is `tmp`). We need to ensure that `lst[z]` is not an empty list for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing edges from each node to its neighbors based on user inputs, `rev` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing reverse edges for each node to its neighbors based on user inputs, `z` is an integer from the input and `lst[z]` is not an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is True**
