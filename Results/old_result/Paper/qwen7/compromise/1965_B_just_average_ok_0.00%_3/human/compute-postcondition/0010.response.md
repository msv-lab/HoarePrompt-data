Output State: `idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 \ll idx\). Given that `idx` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will continue to do so until \(1 \ll idx\) exceeds `k`. Since the maximum value of `k` can be up to 1000 (as per the constraints), the loop will run until `idx` reaches 24 because \(1 \ll 24 = 16777216\), which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 1000. At this point, `k` must be less than \(1 \ll 24\), meaning `k` must be at least 16777216 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.
