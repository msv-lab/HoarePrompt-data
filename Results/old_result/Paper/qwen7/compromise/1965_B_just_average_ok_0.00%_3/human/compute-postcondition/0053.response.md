Output State: **`idx` is 3, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` is a list with the last element being k + 4**.

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. The new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 3 and the last element of `nums` is `k + 1`, we substitute `nums[idx]` with `k + 1`. Thus, the new value appended to `nums` is `k + (k + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `2k + 2`. Since the last element of `nums` before appending was `k + 1`, the new last element becomes `k + 1 + 2 - 1 = k + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
