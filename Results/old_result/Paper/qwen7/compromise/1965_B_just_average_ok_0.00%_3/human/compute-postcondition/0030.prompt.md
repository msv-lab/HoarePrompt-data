Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` is the second integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.
Code of the loop:
while k >= 1 << idx:
    idx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` is the second integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `idx` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `idx` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
