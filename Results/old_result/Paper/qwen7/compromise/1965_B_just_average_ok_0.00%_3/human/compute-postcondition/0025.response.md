The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. To determine which states need to be adjusted, let's analyze the variables involved in the loop head:

- `k`: The value of `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << idx` for the loop to continue.
- `idx`: The value of `idx` will increment within the loop body.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `idx` is 1.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`.
- `k` is the second integer from `map(int, input().split())`.
- `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still satisfy the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. Since `idx` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to \(1 << 2 = 4\).

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.**
