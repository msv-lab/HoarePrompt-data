Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (such that 1 <= t <= 1000), and for each `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n). The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7. For each test case, the function processes `n` and `k` and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integer values `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes `n` and `k` for each test case and returns a result accordingly, without directly accepting these parameters as function arguments.
