Output: **len(nums) (where len(nums) is the length of the list nums)**

Explanation:
- `idx` is explicitly given as 3.
- `k` must be at least 8, but its exact value is not specified.
- `nums` does not contain the element 1 << 3 (which is 8).
- The last element of `nums` is `k + 4`.

Since the length of the list `nums` is not directly provided, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that the `print(len(nums))` statement will output the length of the list `nums`. Therefore, the output is `len(nums)`, where `len(nums)` represents the number of elements in the list `nums`.
