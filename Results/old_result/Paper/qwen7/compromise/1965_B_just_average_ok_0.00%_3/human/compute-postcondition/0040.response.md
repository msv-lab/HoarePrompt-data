Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 with the 24th element being `k - 16777216`, an additional element `k + 16777216`, and the element 16777216 has been removed from `nums`, and `nums` now contains an additional element `k - 24`, and `nums` now includes the element `k + 1`, and `nums` now includes the element `k + 25`.**

Explanation: The code replaces the existing list comprehension with a new list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This means the list `nums` is now \([1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 16777216]\), which is equivalent to \([2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^{23}]\). The 24th element (index 23) is set to `k - 2^{23}`. After that, the 24th element is replaced with `k - 24`, and two additional elements `k + 1` and `k + 25` are added to the list. The elements `16777216` and `2^{24}` (which is 16777216) are removed from the list.
