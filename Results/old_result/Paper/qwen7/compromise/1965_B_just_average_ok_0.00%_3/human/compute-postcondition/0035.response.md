Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\), `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`, and `nums` now contains an additional element `k - nums[24]`, and `nums` now includes the element `k + 1`, and `nums` now includes the element `k + nums[idx] + 1` which is `k + 25`, and the element \(2^{24}\) has been removed from `nums`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element \(2^{24}\) from the list `nums`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
