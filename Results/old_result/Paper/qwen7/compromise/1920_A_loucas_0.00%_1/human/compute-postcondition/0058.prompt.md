Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`, and `innerLoop` will still be greater than 0. The values of `x` and `a` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. If `x` is 1, `a` will be appended to `big`; if `x` is 2, `a` will be appended to `less`; otherwise, `a` will be appended to `no`. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain all the values of `a` that correspond to the respective conditions across all iterations of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer within the range `min(less)` to `max(big) - 1`, and `num` is equal to `i`. If `i` is not in the set `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in the set `no`, no specific action is taken other than continuing to check other conditions or loops.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `min(less)`, `num` is `min(less)`. If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `min(less) + 1`, `num` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i` is not in `no`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
