Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` is currently `num`, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, `big` must contain at least 1 integer, and the current value of `i` is not in `no`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state, except that we indicate that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
