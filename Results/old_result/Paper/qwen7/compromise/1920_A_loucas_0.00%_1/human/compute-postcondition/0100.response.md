Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` is currently `num`, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, `big` must contain at least 1 integer, and the current value of `i` is not in `no`.**

Explanation: The code `num = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `num`. Since the initial value of `i` was `min(less) + 2`, the new value of `num` is also `min(less) + 2`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
