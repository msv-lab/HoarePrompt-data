Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `a` is updated to the second integer input and appended to `no`, `iterable2` is 1, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` (which is the second integer input) to the list `no`. The other variables (`x`, `iterable2`, and `innerLoop`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
