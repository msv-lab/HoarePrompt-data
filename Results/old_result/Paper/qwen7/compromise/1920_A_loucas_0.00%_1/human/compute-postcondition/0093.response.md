Postcondition: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `i` is `min(less) + 2`, `num` is 0, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is either a list containing `a` or an empty list, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, and `iterable2` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that the values and relationships of the variables remain consistent regardless of whether the condition `x == 2` is true or false.
