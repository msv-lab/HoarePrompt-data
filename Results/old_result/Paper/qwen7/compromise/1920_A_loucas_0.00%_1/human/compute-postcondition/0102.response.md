Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` is currently `num`, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, `big` must contain at least 1 integer. If the current value of `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `i not in no` is false.
