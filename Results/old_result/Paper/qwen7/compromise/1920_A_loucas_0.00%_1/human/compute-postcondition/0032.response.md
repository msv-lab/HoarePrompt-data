Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `a` is appended to the list `big`, `iterable2` is 2, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an integer (as per the initial state), appending it to the list `big` modifies the list `big` to include this new element. The other variables (`x`, `iterable2`, and `innerLoop`) remain unchanged.
