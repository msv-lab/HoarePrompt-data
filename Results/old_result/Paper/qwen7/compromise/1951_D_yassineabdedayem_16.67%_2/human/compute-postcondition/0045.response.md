Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `Min` is 0.
- `Max` is 0.
- `number` is 0.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` after each iteration, which will have 60 elements.
- The current value of `k` is 0.

The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
