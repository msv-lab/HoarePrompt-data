Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `n // k`, `Max` is `int(n / k)`, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `int(n / k)`**.

Explanation: The line `number = Max` updates the value of `number` to be equal to `Max`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
