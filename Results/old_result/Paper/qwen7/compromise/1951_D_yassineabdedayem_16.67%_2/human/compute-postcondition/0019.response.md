Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `rep` is `rep + 1`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Min` or `k - Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list that now contains the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The variable `rep` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and relationships. The specific values of `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab` remain as they were before the execution of the code, with `tab` containing the string representation of `number`.
