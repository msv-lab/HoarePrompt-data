Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, and `t` is 61.**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `n // k` and `k` to `Min`, and the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k` to `Max`. Since the exact value of `n` and `k` are not specified, `Min` and `Max` are expressed in terms of these variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
