Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the second element of `tab`.
- `tab` is a list containing at least 60 elements.
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `Min` is 0.
- `Max` is 0.
- `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `tab`.

Since the exact value of the second element (`i`) is not specified, we can only describe it as the second element of the list `tab`.

Output: **the second element of tab**
