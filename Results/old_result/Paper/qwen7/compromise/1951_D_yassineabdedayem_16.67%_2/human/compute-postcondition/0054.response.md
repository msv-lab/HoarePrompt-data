Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` with 60 elements.

Explanation: The loop iterates 60 times based on the value of `rep`, which is set to 60. Each iteration appends the string representation of `number` (which remains 0 throughout) to the list `tab`. After 60 iterations, `tab` will contain 60 elements, all being the string "0". The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` do not change during the loop's execution. Therefore, after all iterations, these variables retain their initial values, and `tab` contains 60 elements, each being "0".
