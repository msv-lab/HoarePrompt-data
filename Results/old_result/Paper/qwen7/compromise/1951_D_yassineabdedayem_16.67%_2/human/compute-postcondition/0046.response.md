Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `Min` is 0.
- `Max` is 0.
- `number` is 0.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` after each iteration, which will have 60 elements.
- The current value of `k` is 0.

The `tab` list is initialized with 60 elements, each being the string representation of `number` (which is 0). Therefore, `tab` will look like this: `['0', '0', '0', ..., '0']` (60 times).

When the `print(len(tab))` statement is executed, it will print the length of the `tab` list, which is 60.

Output: **60**
