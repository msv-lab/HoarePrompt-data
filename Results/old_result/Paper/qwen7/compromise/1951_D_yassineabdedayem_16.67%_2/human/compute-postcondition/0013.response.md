Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must not be 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Max` to the variable `number`. Since `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, the variable `number` now holds the value of `Max`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
