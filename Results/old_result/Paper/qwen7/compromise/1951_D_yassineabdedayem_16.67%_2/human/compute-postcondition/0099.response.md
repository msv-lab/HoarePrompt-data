Output State: **`rep` is 2, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `Min` and `Max`, and `number` is appended to `tab`, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. Since `Min` and `Max` are defined as `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively, their values are dependent on `n` and `k`. However, the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, so we keep them in terms of their definitions. The other variables (`rep`, `tab`, `number`) remain unchanged.
