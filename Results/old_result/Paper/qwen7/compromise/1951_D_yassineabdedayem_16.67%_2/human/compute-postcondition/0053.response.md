Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `Min` is 0.
- `Max` is 0.
- `number` is 0.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` with at least two elements remaining.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, there is no explicit value given for `i`. Since `i` is not defined or initialized anywhere in the provided initial state, it is not possible to determine the exact value of `i` without additional context. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `i` at the time of execution, which is not specified.

Given this information, the output will be the value of `i` followed by a space, but since `i` is undefined, we cannot provide a specific value.

Output: **i (where i is an undefined variable)**
