Output State: `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is a list containing 60 elements, each element being '0', and `t` is 61.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not 0, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Given that `k` is initially a non-positive integer and the conditions inside the loop modify `k` to eventually become 0, the loop will run until `rep` reaches 60 or `n` becomes 0. Since `k` is non-positive and gets decremented in each iteration, it will reach 0 before `rep` reaches 60, causing the loop to terminate when `k` is 0. At this point, `n` will also be 0 because it keeps getting reduced by `Min * Max` in each iteration. All other variables (`Min`, `Max`, `number`, `tab`) will be 0 as they are reset or updated to 0 in the loop's logic. The list `tab` will contain 60 elements, each being the string representation of `number`, which is 0 in this case.
