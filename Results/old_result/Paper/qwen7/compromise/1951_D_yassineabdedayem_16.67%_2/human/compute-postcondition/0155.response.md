Postcondition: **`n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `number` is `min((n // (k - Max)) // (k - Max), k - Max)`. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `Min`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`.**
