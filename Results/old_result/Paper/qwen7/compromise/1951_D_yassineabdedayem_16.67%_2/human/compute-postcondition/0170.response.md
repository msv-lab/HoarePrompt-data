Based on the initial state provided:

- `tab` is a list that must have at least two elements.
- `i` will be the next element in the list `tab`.

When the `print(i, end=' ')` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is the next element in the list `tab`. Since `tab` has at least two elements, `i` will be one of these elements.

Output: **[element in tab] (where [element in tab] is the next element in the list `tab`)**
