Output State: **`n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `n // k`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k), `k` is decreased by `Min`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `Min`, which is equal to `n // k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
