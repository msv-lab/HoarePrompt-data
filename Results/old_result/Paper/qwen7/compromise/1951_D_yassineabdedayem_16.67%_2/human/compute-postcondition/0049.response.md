Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `Min` is 0.
- `Max` is 0.
- `number` is 0.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` after each iteration, which will have 60 elements.

The code snippet `print(i, end=' ')` is executed within a loop context that is not explicitly provided in the initial state. However, the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function indicates that the default newline character (`\n`) is replaced with a space, meaning that the output will be printed on the same line with each subsequent print statement separated by a space.

Given that `i` is not defined in the initial state and there's no explicit initialization or update provided for `i`, we can infer that `i` is likely a loop counter starting from 0 and incrementing with each iteration. Since the exact loop structure is not provided, we assume it runs for `rep` times, which is 60.

Therefore, the `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` (which starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time) followed by a space, for a total of 60 times.

Output: **0 1 2 3 ... 58 59**
