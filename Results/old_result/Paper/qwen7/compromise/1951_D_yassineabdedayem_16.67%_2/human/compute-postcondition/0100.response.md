Output State: **`rep` is 3, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `Min` and `Max`, and `number` is appended to `tab`, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.**

Explanation: The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `Min`, `Max`, `tab`, and the operation on `n` remain unchanged as no further information about their specific values is provided.
