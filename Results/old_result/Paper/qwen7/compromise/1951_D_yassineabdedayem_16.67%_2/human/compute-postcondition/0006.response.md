Let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

We need to ensure that all these conditions are met for the loop to execute at least once.

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This does not affect the loop conditions directly.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in the input.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in the input.
- `rep` is 0.
- `number` is 0.
- `tab` is an empty list.

Given the current state:
- `rep` is 0, which satisfies `rep < 60`.
- `number` and `tab` do not affect the loop conditions.

So, we need to focus on `n`, `k`, and `n >= k`.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- `n` must not be 0.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Since `rep` is already 0, it satisfies `rep < 60`. We just need to ensure the other conditions are met.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must not be 0.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must not be 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
