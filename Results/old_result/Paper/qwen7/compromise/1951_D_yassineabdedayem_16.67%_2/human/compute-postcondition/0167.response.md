Based on the initial state provided:

- `tab` is a list that must have at least one element.
- `i` will be the next element in the list.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`, which is the next element in the list `tab`. Since `tab` has at least one element, `i` will be the first element of `tab`.

Output: **the first element of tab**
