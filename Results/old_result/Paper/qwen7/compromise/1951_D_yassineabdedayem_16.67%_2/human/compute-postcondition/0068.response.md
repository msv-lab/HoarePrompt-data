Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `k`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `tab` is an empty list, and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Min` to `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` now holds the same value as `Min`. All other variables remain unchanged.
