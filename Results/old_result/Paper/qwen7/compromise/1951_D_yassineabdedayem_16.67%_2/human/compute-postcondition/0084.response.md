Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, `k` is `Min - Min`, `Min` is `n // k`, `Max` is `int(n / k)`, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `int(n / k)`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` subtracts `Min` from `k`. Given that `k` was initially a positive integer and `Min` is also a positive integer (as it is derived from `n` which is a non-zero integer and `k`), `k` is now `k - Min`. All other variables remain unchanged.
