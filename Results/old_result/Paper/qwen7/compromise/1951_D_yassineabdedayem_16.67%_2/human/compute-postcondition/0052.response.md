Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tab:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `Min` is 0.
   - `Max` is 0.
   - `number` is 0.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` with at least one element remaining.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `tab`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over `tab`, at the end of the previous iteration, `tab` had at least one element.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least two elements remaining (one for the current iteration and one for the next iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop head.
- `rep` remains 60.
- `n` remains 0.
- `k` remains 0.
- `Min` remains 0.
- `Max` remains 0.
- `number` remains 0.
- `tab` must have at least two elements remaining.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` with at least two elements remaining**
