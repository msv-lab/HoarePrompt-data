Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the third element of `tab`.
- `tab` is a list containing at least 60 elements.
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `Min` is 0.
- `Max` is 0.
- `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`, which is the third element of `tab`.

Output: **the third element of tab**
