Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer minus `k`, `Min` is `min(n // (k - k), k - k)`, `Max` is `k - k`, `number` is `min(n // (k - k), k - k)`, `tab` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from it. Given that `Max` is initially `k`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - k`, which is `0`. Since `k` is now `0`, the values of `Min`, `Max`, and `number` are recalculated using `k - k`, resulting in `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
