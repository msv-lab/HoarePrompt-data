Output State: **`rep` is 2, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of either `Min` or `Max` and now includes the string representation of `Min`.**

Explanation: The code sets `number` to `Min`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` now holds the value of `Min`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
