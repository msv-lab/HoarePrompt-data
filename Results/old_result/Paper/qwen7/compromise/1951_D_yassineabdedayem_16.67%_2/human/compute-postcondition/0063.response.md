Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is an integer read from the standard input, `k` is either 0 or greater than 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `tab` as an empty list. This means that the list `tab` now contains no elements, while all other variables retain their initial values.
