Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition, `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` or `min(n // (k - Min), k - Min)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int((n - Min * Max) / (k - Max)), k - Max)` or `max(int(n / (k - Min)), k - Min)`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list containing `str(number)` appended, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `n` is now `n - Min * Max`.
