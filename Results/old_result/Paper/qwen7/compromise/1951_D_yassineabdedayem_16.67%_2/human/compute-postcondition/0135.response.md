Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `k` is updated based on the condition (`k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k - min(n // k, k)`), `Min` is updated accordingly (`min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `min(n // k, k)`), `Max` is updated accordingly (`k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `max(int(n / k), k)`), `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the condition, `tab` is a list containing `str(number)`, and `t` is 61.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `number` to the list `tab`. Since `tab` was initially an empty list, after appending `str(number)`, `tab` now contains one element, which is the string representation of `number`. All other variables retain their previous values.
