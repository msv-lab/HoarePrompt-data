Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through potential stall prices and determining how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `Min` and `Max`:**
   - The current logic calculates `Min` and `Max` incorrectly. It should ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by adjusting the prices dynamically.
   - The condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:` is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of jewels.

2. **Logic for Setting Prices:**
   - The program tries to set prices based on the remaining coins and jewels but does not correctly distribute the purchases across stalls.
   - The loop should dynamically adjust the prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, which is not achieved with the current logic.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is less than `k`, or when Alice cannot buy any more jewels after setting up 60 stalls.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is incorrect. If the answer is "YES," the program should print the number of stalls and the prices, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
