Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, the program attempts to distribute the number of jewels across stalls in a way that may not always result in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Logic for Distributing Jewels**: The program tries to distribute the number of jewels across stalls by calculating `Min` and `Max` values based on the remaining coins `n` and the desired number of jewels `k`. However, the logic for determining `Min` and `Max` is flawed. For example, if `n` is less than `k`, the program might incorrectly distribute the jewels, leading to Alice not buying exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case `(n=7, k=3)`: The program should output "YES" and distribute the jewels correctly. However, the current logic might not handle this case properly. For instance, if `n` is exactly divisible by `k`, the program might not distribute the jewels correctly.
   - Consider the test case `(n=6, k=4)`: The program should output "NO" because it is impossible to distribute the jewels such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels. However, the current logic might incorrectly output "YES" and distribute the jewels in a way that does not meet the requirement.

3. **Specific Example**:
   - For the test case `(n=255, k=8)`, the program should output "YES" and distribute the jewels correctly. However, the current logic might not handle this case correctly. For example, if the program tries to distribute the jewels in a way that does not account for the exact number of jewels Alice needs to buy, it might fail to meet the requirement.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels for every potential input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
