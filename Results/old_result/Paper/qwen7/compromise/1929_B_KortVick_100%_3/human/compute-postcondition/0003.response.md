Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either the result of `k // 2 + 1` or `ceil(k / 2)`, depending on whether `4 * n - 2` equals `k` for each iteration of the loop. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). Each line's content depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` provided in the input for that iteration.
