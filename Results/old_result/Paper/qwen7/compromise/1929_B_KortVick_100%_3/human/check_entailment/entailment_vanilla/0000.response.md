Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `4 * n - 2 == k`.
     - If this condition is true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - A key observation is that each cell can belong to up to 4 diagonals (two main diagonals and two anti-diagonals).

4. **Correctness of the Condition Check:**
   - If `4 * n - 2 == k`, it means we need to cover all `4n - 2` diagonals.
   - To cover all diagonals, we need to color cells in such a way that every diagonal has at least one colored cell.
   - One optimal strategy is to color cells along the main and anti-diagonals, which can be done by coloring `n` cells (one from each row and column intersection).
   - Since each cell covers two diagonals, we need to color `n` cells to ensure all `4n - 2` diagonals are covered.
   - Thus, the formula `k // 2 + 1` is correct when `k == 4 * n - 2`.

5. **General Case:**
   - For other values of `k`, the program uses `ceil(k / 2)`.
   - This is because each cell covers 2 diagonals, so the minimum number of cells needed is approximately `k / 2`. The `ceil` function ensures we round up to the nearest whole number.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:** `n = 3`, `k = 4`
  - `4 * 3 - 2 = 10`, but `k = 4`.
  - `ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
  - The solution is correct.

- **Example 2:** `n = 3`, `k = 3`
  - `4 * 3 - 2 = 10`, but `k = 3`.
  - `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
  - The solution is correct.

- **Example 3:** `n = 3`, `k = 10`
  - `4 * 3 - 2 = 10`.
  - `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - The solution is correct.

- **Example 4:** `n = 3`, `k = 9`
  - `4 * 3 - 2 = 10`, but `k = 9`.
  - `ceil(9 / 2) = 5`.
  - The solution is correct.

- **Example 5:** `n = 4`, `k = 7`
  - `4 * 4 - 2 = 14`, but `k = 7`.
  - `ceil(7 / 2) = 4`.
  - The solution is correct.

- **Example 6:** `n = 7`, `k = 11`
  - `4 * 7 - 2 = 26`, but `k = 11`.
  - `ceil(11 / 2) = 6`.
  - The solution is correct.

- **Example 7:** `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - `4 * 2 - 2 = 6`, but `k = 3`.
  - `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
  - The solution is correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both the special case where `4 * n - 2 == k` and the general case where `4 * n - 2 != k`. It calculates the minimum number of cells to color accurately for all given test cases.

**Correctness: True**
