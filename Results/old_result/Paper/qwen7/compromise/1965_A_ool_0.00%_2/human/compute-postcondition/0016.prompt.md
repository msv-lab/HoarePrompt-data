You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in arr (a_i) satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'
    #State: `A` is False, arr[0] is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: A is True; arr[0] is 1; set_ is [1]; not_c is True.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the elements of `set_`, which initially contains only one element [1]. Since the loop starts from index 1 and there are no more elements in `set_` to iterate over, the loop body is never executed. Therefore, the value of `A` remains `False` (initially) and then becomes `True` due to the statement `A = not A`. The values of `arr[0]` and `not_c` remain unchanged.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is True; `arr[0]` is 1; `set_` is [1]; `not_c` is False.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies the condition 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each element in `arr` (denoted as `a_i`) satisfies the condition 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Based on the execution of the function, there are two possible return values: 'Alice' and 'Alice'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return 'Alice' in both cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
