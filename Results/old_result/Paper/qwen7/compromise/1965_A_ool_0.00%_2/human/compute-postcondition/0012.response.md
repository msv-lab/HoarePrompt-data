Postcondition: **`A` is True; `arr[0]` is 1; `set_` is [1]; `not_c` is False.**

Explanation: Given the precondition and the if condition, since `not_c` is initially `True`, the if block is executed. Inside the if block, `A` is set to `not A`, which changes `A` from `False` to `True`. Additionally, `not_c` is set to `False`. The values of `arr[0]` and `set_` remain unchanged as the loop body is not executed.
