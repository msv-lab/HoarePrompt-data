Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case incorrectly. The number of piles `n` is read as part of the array `arr`, which is incorrect. `n` should be read separately before reading the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: 
   - The function always returns 'Alice' regardless of the input array `arr`. This is incorrect because the outcome depends on the specific configuration of the piles.
   - The logic to determine the winner is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the first element is 1 and whether there are consecutive elements with a difference greater than 1, but it does not correctly simulate the game rules.

3. **Game Rules Not Followed**: The program does not simulate the game moves or correctly determine the winner based on the optimal strategy. The game involves removing a common value `k` from all non-empty piles, and the winner is determined by who cannot make a move when all piles are empty.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
