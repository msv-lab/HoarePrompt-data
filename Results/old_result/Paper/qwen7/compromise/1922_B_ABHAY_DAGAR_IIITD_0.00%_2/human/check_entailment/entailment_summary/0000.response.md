Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program attempts to count the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect cube and the number of ways to choose two sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect square. However, the problem requires counting the number of ways to choose three sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle, which means the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.

The program's logic for calculating the number of ways to form triangles is incorrect. Specifically, the program should check the triangle inequality condition (i.e., \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\)) for each combination of three sticks, rather than just counting the occurrences of each stick length.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
