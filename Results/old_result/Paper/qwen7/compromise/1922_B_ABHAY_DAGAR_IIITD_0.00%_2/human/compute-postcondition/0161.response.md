Output State: **`total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt_next` plus `cnt`, and `res` remains unchanged if `cnt` is less than 2, otherwise `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. The conditions for updating `res` based on the value of `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `total_count` and the condition-based update of `res`.
