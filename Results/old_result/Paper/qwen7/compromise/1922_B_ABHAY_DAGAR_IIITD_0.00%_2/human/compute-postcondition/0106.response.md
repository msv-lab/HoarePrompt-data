Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3 after the calculation, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * total_count // 2` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The conditions for updating `res` remain unchanged, and `cnt` is updated to the next value in `num_of_lens` that meets the specified conditions.
