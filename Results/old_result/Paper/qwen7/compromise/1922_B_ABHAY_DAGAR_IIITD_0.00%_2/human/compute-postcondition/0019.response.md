Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element in `num_list`) has its value incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. Since `x` is the second element in `num_list`, its count in `num_of_lens` is incremented. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
