Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in num_list`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x`, `num_list`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: For each `x` in `num_list`, the loop body is executed. After each iteration, `x` takes the next value from `num_list`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `x` will take the next value from `num_list`.
   - `num_list` remains unchanged as it is the iterable.

4. **Check the postconditions**:
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element in `num_list`) either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether `x` is already in `num_of_lens`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` will take the next value from `num_list`, the next value of `x` will be the first element of `num_list` (if it hasn't been used yet).
   - `num_list` remains the same.
   - `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element in `num_list`) either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, and if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `x` is set to 1.**
