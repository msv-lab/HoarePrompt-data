Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over `cnt` values from `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `total_count`: This is derived from the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt`.
   - `res`: This is updated based on the value of `cnt`.
     - If `cnt >= 3`, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value.
     - If `cnt >= 2`, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value.
     - If `cnt < 2`, `res` remains unchanged.

Given that we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The next value of `cnt` will be the next key in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `total_count` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus the new `cnt`.
- `res` will be updated based on the new `cnt` as described above.

Since we don't know the exact value of `cnt` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote it as `cnt_prev`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Next `cnt` value**: The next `cnt` value will be the next key in `num_of_lens.values()`. Let's denote this as `cnt_next`.
2. **Next `total_count` value**: `total_count_next = num_of_lens.values()[next_index] + cnt_next`, where `next_index` is the index of the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
3. **Update `res`**: Depending on the value of `cnt_next`:
   - If `cnt_next >= 3`, `res` will be updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * (cnt_next - 2) // 6` to its current value.
   - If `cnt_next >= 2`, `res` will be updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * total_count_next // 2` to its current value.
   - If `cnt_next < 2`, `res` remains unchanged.

### Final State:

- `total_count` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt_next`.
- `res` will be updated based on the new `cnt_next` as described above.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt_next`, and `res` is updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * (cnt_next - 2) // 6` to its current value if `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value. If `cnt_next` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.**
