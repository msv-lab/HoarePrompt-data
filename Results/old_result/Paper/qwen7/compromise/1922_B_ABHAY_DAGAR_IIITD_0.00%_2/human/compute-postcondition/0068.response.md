Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `total_count` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `x` is the second element of `num_list`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `total_count` is the sum of all values in the original `num_of_lens`, which does not change since only one value in the dictionary is modified. Similarly, `res` is the cumulative result of applying formulas to values in `num_of_lens` that meet certain conditions, which also does not change because no such conditions are specified here. `test_cases` is decremented by 1 but must remain greater than 0. `results` now includes the updated value of `res`. `num_list` and `x` (the second element of `num_list`) remain as they were before the code execution.
