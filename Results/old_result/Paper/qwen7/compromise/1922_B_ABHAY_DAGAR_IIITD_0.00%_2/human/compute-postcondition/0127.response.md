Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is now 1, `x` is the third element in the updated `num_list`, `res` remains unchanged, `total_count` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (excluding the first two elements)**.

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1 if `x` did not previously exist in the dictionary. Since `x` is the third element in the updated `num_list`, this value is now stored in `num_of_lens` with a count of 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
