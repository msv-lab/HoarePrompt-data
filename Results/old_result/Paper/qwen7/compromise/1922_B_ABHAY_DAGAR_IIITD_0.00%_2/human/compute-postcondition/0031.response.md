Postcondition: `total_count` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` is `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 if the current count (`cnt`) is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.
