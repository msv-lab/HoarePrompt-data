Output State: **`total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` is equal to `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since the initial condition for `res` is that it remains 0 if `cnt` is less than 2, and it is set to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, the value of `res` is now `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
