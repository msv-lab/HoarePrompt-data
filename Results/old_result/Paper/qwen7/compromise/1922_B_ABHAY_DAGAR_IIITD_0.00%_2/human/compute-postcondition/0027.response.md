Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The only variable being iterated over here is `cnt`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `cnt`**: Since `cnt` is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` contains at least one value for the loop to execute.

3. **Check the initial state of `num_of_lens`**: The problem states that `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from `num_list` either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether the key is already present in `num_of_lens`. Given that `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust other relevant states**: We need to ensure that `total_count`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_list` are in their respective initial states as given. However, these states do not directly affect the execution of the loop since they are not used within the loop head.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is `num_of_lens` to ensure it contains at least one value.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total_count` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0**
