Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`. This means the loop variable is `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the loop runs `test_cases` times.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.
   - `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not change during the loop.
   - The number of test cases (`test_cases`) is fixed and does not change inside the loop.
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.
   - `res` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, but since we are looking at the state before the loop starts, `res` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `total_count` remains unchanged.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and since the loop has not yet started, `results` remains an empty list or its previous state.

Given these points, the state does not need to be adjusted for the next iteration because the loop has not yet executed, and the variables remain in their previous state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`.**
