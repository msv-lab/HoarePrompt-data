Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the values in `num_of_lens`. The loop continues as long as there are values left in `num_of_lens`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `res` is updated to `res` plus `cnt` times (`cnt` minus 1) times (`cnt` minus 2) divided by 6.
   - `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, it still contains the same values.
   - For the loop to continue, `num_of_lens` must have at least one value remaining.
   - `cnt` will be set to the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `res` and `total_count` will be updated based on the new value of `cnt`, but since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to include these updates.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3**
