Output State: `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of all values calculated from the formulae `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for each `cnt` greater than or equal to 3, and `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for each `cnt` greater than or equal to 2, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will still contain the same counts of each integer from `num_list`. The variable `res` will hold the cumulative result of applying the given formulas to each count in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions (at least 3 for the first formula and at least 2 for the second formula). The variable `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, as it gets incremented by each count in every iteration of the loop.
