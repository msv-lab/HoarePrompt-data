Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3, and `res` is updated to `res` plus `cnt` times (`cnt` minus 1) times (`cnt` minus 2) divided by 6.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Here, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3, and `total_count` is implied to be a variable that holds a specific value (though its exact value is not provided). The value of `num_of_lens` and the other values of `cnt` in `num_of_lens` that are not used in this calculation remain unchanged. The updated value of `res` is the original value of `res` plus the calculated value.
