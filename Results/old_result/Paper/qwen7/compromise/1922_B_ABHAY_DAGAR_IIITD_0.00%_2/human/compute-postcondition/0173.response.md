Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. For each tuple, it calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect cube and the number of ways to choose two sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect square. It then sums these counts across all tuples and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints each result in the list.**
