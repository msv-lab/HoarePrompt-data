Output State: **`res` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key `x` from the original `num_list` (and any new elements added during the loop) has a corresponding value representing the count of occurrences of `x`. `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and any new entries added during the loop. `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`. `n` is the input integer provided initially, and `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (after all iterations of the loop). The variable `x` represents the current element being processed in `num_list` during the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes `res` to 0. No changes are made to `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `results`, `n`, or `num_list`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
