Postcondition: `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` is equal to `res` + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.
