The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, and a list of integers `a` where each `a_i` represents the exponent used to calculate the length of the i-th stick as \(2^{a_i}\).

The function returns a list of lengths for each set of sticks described in the `test_cases`. For each tuple in `test_cases`, the function calculates the length of each stick using the formula \(2^{a_i}\) and returns a list of these lengths.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The function returns a list of stick lengths calculated as \(2^{a_i}\) for each stick.**
