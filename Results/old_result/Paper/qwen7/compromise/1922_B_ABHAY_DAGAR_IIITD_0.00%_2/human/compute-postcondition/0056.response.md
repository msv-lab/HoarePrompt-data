Output State: **`num_of_lens` is processed as before, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `num_list`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `res`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
