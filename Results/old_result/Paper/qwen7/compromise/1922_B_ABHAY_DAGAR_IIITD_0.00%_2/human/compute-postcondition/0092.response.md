Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3, and `res` is res plus cnt times (cnt minus 1) times (cnt minus 2) divided by 6.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. Here, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
