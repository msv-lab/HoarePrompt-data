Output State: **The variable `c` is now 122 (ord('z')), `char` remains unchanged from its initial value, and the dictionary `mapping` will map each character from 'a' to 'z' to the initial value of `char`, unless a character's corresponding ASCII value ('a' to 'z') is already a value in `mapping`, in which case the loop will break without adding that key-value pair. If `char` was 'x' initially, then `mapping` will contain keys from 'a' to 'z' with the value 'x', except for any characters whose corresponding ASCII values were already present as values in `mapping` before the loop started.**

Explanation: The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `c` (which is 122, i.e., 'z') to the list `decoded`. This does not affect the values of `c`, `char`, or the dictionary `mapping`. The dictionary `mapping` still maps each character from 'a' to 'z' to the initial value of `char` ('x'), unless a character's corresponding ASCII value is already a value in `mapping`.
