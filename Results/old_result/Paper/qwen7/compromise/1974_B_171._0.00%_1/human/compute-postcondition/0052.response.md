Postcondition: `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'. If `chr(c)` (where `c` is 97) is not in `mapping.values()`, then `decoded` is updated to include the decoded value corresponding to `char`. If `chr(c)` (where `c` is 98) is in `mapping.values()`, then no change is made to `decoded`.
