You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: Output State: The `decoded` list contains all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, followed by an additional 'z'. The `mapping` dictionary maps each lowercase English letter from 'a' to 'z' to the last unique character processed in the `encoded` string during the loop's final iteration. If any character in `encoded` was encountered multiple times, it would be mapped to the last occurrence. The variable `c` retains its value of 122 (the ASCII value for 'z').
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `decoded` list will contain every lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, plus an extra 'z'. The `mapping` dictionary will map each letter from 'a' to 'z' to the last character from `encoded` that wasn't already mapped to another letter, ensuring no duplicates. The variable `c` will still be 122, representing the ASCII value of 'z'.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz"
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter encoded, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz"

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz"


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
