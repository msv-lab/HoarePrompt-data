Postcondition: **`c` must be within the range 99 to 124 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping[chr(c)]` is set to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
