Output State: **`char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', `c` is 122, and `decoded` has an additional element which is the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`.**

Explanation: The code appends the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping` to the list `decoded`. The initial state of `decoded` either already contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', or it has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`. Since the code simply appends the decoded value to `decoded`, the updated state of `decoded` will include the new element. All other variables remain unchanged.
