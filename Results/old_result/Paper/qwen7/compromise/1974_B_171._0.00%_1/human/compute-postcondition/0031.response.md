Postcondition: `c` must be within the range 97 to 123 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` either remains unchanged or has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `chr(c)` in `mapping`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
