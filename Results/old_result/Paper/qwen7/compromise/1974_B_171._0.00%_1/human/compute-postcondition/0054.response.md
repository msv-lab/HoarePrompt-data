Output State: **`c` is 98, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'; `mapping['c']` is `char`.**

Explanation: The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the dictionary `mapping` by setting the key `chr(c)` (which is `'c'` since `c` is 98) to the value `char`. The other variables (`c`, `char`, and `decoded`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
