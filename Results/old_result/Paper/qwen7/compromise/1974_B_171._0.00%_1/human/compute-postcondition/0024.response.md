Postcondition: **`char` is a character, `decoded` is a list where it either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` remains unchanged. Additionally, `c` is set to 122 (ord('z')), `char` remains unchanged from its initial value, and the dictionary `mapping` will map each character from 'a' to 'z' to the initial value of `char`, unless a character's corresponding ASCII value ('a' to 'z') is already a value in `mapping`, in which case the loop will break without adding that key-value pair.**
