Output State: **`c` is 99; `char` is the next character in `encoded`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the block where `mapping[chr(99)]` is assigned the value of `char`. The values of `c` and `char` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it was in.
