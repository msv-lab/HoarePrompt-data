Output State: **`c` is 122, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' mapped to the initial `char`, and `char` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `c` will have gone through all values from 97 to 122 (inclusive). The loop checks if each character from 'a' to 'z' is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary. If it finds a character that is not yet a value, it maps that character to `char` and breaks out of the loop. Since the loop continues until all characters from 'a' to 'z' are checked, `char` will be mapped to itself for each character in the range 'a' to 'z'. Therefore, `decoded` will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' mapped to the initial value of `char`.
