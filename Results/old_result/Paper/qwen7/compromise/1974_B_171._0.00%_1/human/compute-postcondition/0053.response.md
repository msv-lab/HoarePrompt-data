Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `c`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` takes values from 97 to 122 (the ASCII values for 'a' to 'z').

3. **Analyze the postcondition**: 
   - `char` is the next character in `encoded`.
   - `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'.
   - If `chr(c)` (where `c` is 97) is not in `mapping.values()`, then `decoded` is updated to include the decoded value corresponding to `char`.
   - If `chr(c)` (where `c` is 98) is in `mapping.values()`, then no change is made to `decoded`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `c` from 97 to 122, the value of `c` will increase by 1 in each iteration.
   - The value of `char` will be the next character in `encoded` after the previous iteration.
   - The value of `decoded` will either be updated or remain unchanged based on the conditions mentioned.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `c` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `char` will be the next character in `encoded`.
   - `decoded` will either be updated or remain as it was in the previous iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `c` will be `c + 1`.
- `char` will be the next character in `encoded`.
- `decoded` will either be updated or remain unchanged based on the conditions.

Since the exact value of `char` and the updated state of `decoded` depend on the loop body, we cannot specify them precisely without the loop body. However, we can specify the state of `c`.

**State: **`c` is 98, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'. If `chr(97)` (where `c` is 97) is not in `mapping.values()`, then `decoded` is updated to include the decoded value corresponding to `char`. If `chr(98)` (where `c` is 98) is in `mapping.values()`, then no change is made to `decoded`.**
