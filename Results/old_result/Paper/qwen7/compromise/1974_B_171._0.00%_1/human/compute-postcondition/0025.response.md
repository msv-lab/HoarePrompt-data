Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `char` is a character.
   - `decoded` is a list where it either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` remains unchanged.
   - `c` is set to 122 (`ord('z')`).
   - `char` remains unchanged from its initial value.
   - The dictionary `mapping` will map each character from 'a' to 'z' to the initial value of `char`, unless a character's corresponding ASCII value ('a' to 'z') is already a value in `mapping`, in which case the loop will break without adding that key-value pair.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in `encoded`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the description, the loop will update `decoded` if `char` is successfully mapped according to `mapping`.
   - If a character's corresponding ASCII value ('a' to 'z') is already a value in `mapping`, the loop will break.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `encoded`, the variable `char` will change to the next character in `encoded`.
   - The list `decoded` may or may not change depending on whether the current `char` is successfully mapped.
   - The dictionary `mapping` may or may not be updated, but this is not directly reflected in the loop head variables.
   - The variable `c` is set to 122 and does not change within the loop.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in `encoded`.
   - `decoded` may remain unchanged or have one more element added, depending on the mapping.
   - `c` remains 122.
   - `char` remains unchanged from its initial value until the next iteration when it changes to the next character in `encoded`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `char` should be the next character in `encoded`.
- `decoded` may remain unchanged or have one more element added, but since we are focusing on the loop head variables, we cannot directly adjust `decoded` here.
- `c` remains 122.
- `char` remains unchanged from its initial value until the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` remains unchanged, `c` is 122, `char` remains unchanged from its initial value**
