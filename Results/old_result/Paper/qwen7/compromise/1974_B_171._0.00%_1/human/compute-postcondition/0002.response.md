Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over each character in the string `encoded`.
   - The loop variable is `char`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Loop Variables:**
   - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `decoded` is an empty list.
   - `mapping` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in the string `encoded`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `encoded`, the initial state of `char` should be set to the first character of `encoded`.
   - The state of `decoded` and `mapping` does not change based on the loop head, so they remain as initially stated.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial value of `char`, which should be the first character of the string `encoded`.

**State:**
**`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `decoded` is an empty list; `mapping` is an empty dictionary; `char` is the first character of `encoded`**
