Output State: **`c` must be within the range 97 to 123 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in encoded, `decoded` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the value of `mapping[chr(c)]` is being updated. The values of `c`, `char`, and `decoded` remain unchanged, and the program exits the current loop or conditional block.
