Output State: **`c` is 122, `char` remains unchanged, `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'.**

Explanation: The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `c` (which is 122) to the list `decoded`. The ASCII value 122 corresponds to the character 'z'. Therefore, `decoded` now includes all characters from 'a' to 'z', and the variable `char` remains unchanged.
