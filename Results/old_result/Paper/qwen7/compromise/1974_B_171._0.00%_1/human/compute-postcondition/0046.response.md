Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `c` and the range function arguments `ord('a')` and `ord('z') + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`**: The loop starts with `c` set to `ord('a')`. Therefore, `c` should be initialized to `ord('a')` (which is 97) before the loop starts.

3. **Understand the Range Function**: The range function `range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)` generates numbers from `ord('a')` to `ord('z')`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `c` starting from 97 (ord('a')) up to 122 (ord('z')).

4. **Check the Initial Value of `c`**: Given that `c` is 122 initially, it does not match the starting point of the range function, which is 97. Therefore, `c` needs to be adjusted to 97 to start the loop correctly.

5. **Consider the Other Variables**: The variables `char`, `decoded`, and `mapping` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

6. **State Adjustment**: Since the only variable that needs adjustment is `c`, we need to set `c` to `ord('a')` (which is 97).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', `c` is 97**
