The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a specific string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz". It decodes the input string according to a custom mapping rule where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', ensuring each letter appears exactly once in the output. If a character repeats in `encoded`, it is mapped to the last occurrence. After processing, the function appends an extra 'z' to the decoded string.
