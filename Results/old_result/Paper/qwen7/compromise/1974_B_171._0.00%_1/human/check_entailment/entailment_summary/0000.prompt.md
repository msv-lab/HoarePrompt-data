Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

# Program:
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
    return ''.join(decoded)





# Execution Summary:
The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a specific string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz". It decodes the input string according to a custom mapping rule where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', ensuring each letter appears exactly once in the output. If a character repeats in `encoded`, it is mapped to the last occurrence. After processing, the function appends an extra 'z' to the decoded string.
