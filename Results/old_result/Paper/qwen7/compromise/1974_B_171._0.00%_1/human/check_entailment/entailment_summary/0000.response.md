Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. The execution summary indicates that the function `func_1` incorrectly maps characters and appends an extra 'z' to the decoded string. This does not align with the expected behavior of the decoding process.

According to the problem description, the decoding process involves:
1. Constructing an auxiliary string `r` containing all distinct characters of the encoded string in alphabetical order.
2. Replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric counterpart from the string `r`.

The given implementation does not follow these steps. Instead, it creates a mapping from characters in the encoded string to a sequence of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' without considering the distinct characters in the encoded string or their positions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
