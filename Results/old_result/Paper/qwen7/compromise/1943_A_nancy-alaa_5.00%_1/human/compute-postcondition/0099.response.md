Output State: **`i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `i`, which remains 0. It also indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was in. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 and the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` remains unchanged.
