Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `first` is either `False` if `mpp[1]` is 1, or it remains unchanged if `mpp[1]` is not 1. However, the value of `first` is not relevant to the print statement.
- There is a condition that if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since `i` is 1, this condition does not apply here because 1 is typically a key in dictionaries unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given these details, the print statement will simply output the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
