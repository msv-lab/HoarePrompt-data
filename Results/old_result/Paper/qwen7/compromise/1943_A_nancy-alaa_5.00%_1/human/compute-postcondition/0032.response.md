Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1
   - `first` is True (though this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - If `mpp[i] == 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement (this condition is not directly related to the loop head)

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged, so it is still a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The state of `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - The state of `n` remains the same (a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1).
   - The state of `first` is not part of the loop head and does not change for the loop to execute again.
   - The condition `if mpp[i] == 1` is not directly relevant to the loop head and does not affect the loop execution directly.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1**
