Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - If `mpp[i]` (which is `mpp[0]` since `i` is 0) equals 1, then `first` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop condition is `i < n`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 1, `n` must still be a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - The value of `first` will depend on the value of `mpp[1]`. If `mpp[1]` equals 1, `first` will be set to `False`. Otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must be a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `first` will either be `False` if `mpp[1]` is 1, or it will remain unchanged if `mpp[1]` is not 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `first` is either `False` if `mpp[1]` is 1, or it remains unchanged if `mpp[1]` is not 1**.
