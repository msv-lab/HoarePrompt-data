Output State: **i is 3 and n is greater than 3, `first` is True, and `mpp[2]` equals 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is 3 in this case, because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 3. The variable `first` becomes True after the first iteration when `mpp[i]` equals 1 (in this case, `mpp[0]` equals 1). Since the loop continues to check subsequent values of `i` (1 and 2), and given the conditions provided, `mpp[2]` must also equal 1 for the loop to continue without breaking, ensuring `first` remains True.
