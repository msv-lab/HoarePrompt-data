Output State: **`first` is `False`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`.**

The variable `first` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, or `mpp`. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
