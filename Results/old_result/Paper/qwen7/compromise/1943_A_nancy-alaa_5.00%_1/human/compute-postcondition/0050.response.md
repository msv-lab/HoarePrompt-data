Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial state given is `i` is 2.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `n`**: The initial state given is `n` is an input integer. We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above points, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 and `i` is set to the starting value of the loop, which is typically 0 or the first valid index in the range. Since `i` starts at 2, we need to ensure that the loop can still start from `i=0` or `i=1` if necessary, but since `i` is already 2, we just need to ensure `n` allows for at least one iteration starting from `i=2`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 1 to allow the loop to execute.
- `i` should be adjusted to its starting value for the loop, which is typically 0 or the first valid index in the range. Since `i` is already 2, we need to ensure that the loop can start from `i=2`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1**
