Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` must be at least 1. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 and `first` is false, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is true, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.
