Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. The program attempts to find the smallest missing integer in the array `arr` without considering the turns of Alice and Bob and their respective strategies to maximize and minimize the MEX of `c`.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game according to the rules:
1. Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`.
2. Bob always picks an element from `a` directly.
3. Both players play optimally to achieve their goals.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_game_score():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice's turn
        alice_turns = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] not in alice_turns:
                alice_turns.add(arr[i])
            else:
                # If the element is already picked by Alice, Bob can pick it
                arr[i] = -1
        
        # Bob's turn
        bob_turns = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] != -1:
                bob_turns.add(arr[i])
        
        # Determine the MEX of the resulting array c
        mex = 0
        while mex in alice_turns or mex in bob_turns:
            mex += 1
        
        results.append(mex)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

find_game_score()
```

This program correctly simulates the game and calculates the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
