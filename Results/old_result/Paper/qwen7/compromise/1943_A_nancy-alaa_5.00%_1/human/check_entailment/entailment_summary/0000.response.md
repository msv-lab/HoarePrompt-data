Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by finding the smallest index `i` that either does not exist in the list or exists but appears exactly once. However, the logic implemented in the program does not fully align with the optimal strategy required for the game described.

1. **Game Strategy**: In the game, Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. The optimal strategy involves ensuring that the resulting array `c` has the highest possible MEX value for Alice and the lowest possible MEX value for Bob. This means Alice should try to include the smallest numbers in `c` to increase the MEX, while Bob should try to avoid including the smallest numbers to decrease the MEX.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the input list.
   - It then iterates through the indices from `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest index that either does not exist in the list or exists but appears exactly once.
   - If such an index is found, it prints the index; otherwise, it prints the length of the list.

This approach does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob and their respective strategies. The program does not simulate the game turns or consider the optimal moves for both players.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game, and thus the output will not always match the expected results based on the optimal play of both players.

Correctness: **False**
