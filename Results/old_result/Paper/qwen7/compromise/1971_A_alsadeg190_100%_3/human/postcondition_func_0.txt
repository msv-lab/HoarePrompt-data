The function processes a series of test cases, each involving two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it compares \(x\) and \(y\), and prints them in ascending order. If \(x\) is less than \(y\), it prints \(x\) followed by \(y\); otherwise, it prints \(y\) followed by \(x\). The function does not return any value but outputs the sorted pairs of integers for each test case.
