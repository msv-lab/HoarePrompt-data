Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program processes each test case individually but does not handle multiple test cases as required. It should use a loop to process all `t` test cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is not necessary for solving the problem. Instead, we need to find the minimum number of unique cards that cannot be reduced further using the given operation. The logic in the main part of the program is flawed.

3. **Incorrect Output Calculation**: The logic to calculate the minimum number of cards is incorrect. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Find the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        if count % (k - 1) != 0:
            min_cards += 1
    
    results.append(min_cards)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected program properly handles multiple test cases and calculates the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced according to the problem statement.
