You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of `test` lines, each line containing either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on whether the sum of two integers (a and b) entered by the user is even or odd, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` followed by `t` pairs of positive integers `a` and `b`. For each pair, it checks if their sum is even or odd and prints 'Bob' if the sum is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, it outputs a total of `t` lines, each containing either 'Bob' or 'Alice'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Both players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After choosing, a player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - If a player has more than one coin, they can always force a swap and reduce the number of coins in their wallet.
   - The key observation is that the game ends when both players have zero coins.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the moves of the first player (Alice), ensuring that Bob will be the last to make a move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can force Bob into a losing position by mirroring Bob's moves until Bob is left with no valid moves.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `if a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the total number of coins is even or odd.
   - This matches the optimal strategy analysis: if the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the optimal strategy for determining the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
