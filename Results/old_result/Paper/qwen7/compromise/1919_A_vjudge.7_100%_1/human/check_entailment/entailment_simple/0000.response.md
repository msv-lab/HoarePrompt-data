Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic where:
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, Alice wins.
3. The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the values of `a` and `b`, then printing the appropriate winner ('Bob' or 'Alice') based on the parity of the sum.
4. The logic is consistent with the problem statement and the examples provided.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
