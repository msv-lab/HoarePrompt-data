### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Both players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After choosing, a player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - If a player has more than one coin, they can always force a swap and reduce the number of coins in their wallet.
   - The key observation is that the game ends when both players have zero coins.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the moves of the first player (Alice), ensuring that Bob will be the last to make a move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can force Bob into a losing position by mirroring Bob's moves until Bob is left with no valid moves.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `if a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the total number of coins is even or odd.
   - However, the program does not actually simulate the game mechanics as described. Instead, it makes a decision based solely on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - This approach works because the parity of the total number of coins determines the winner based on the optimal strategy analysis provided in the original assessment. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the optimal strategy for determining the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The program does not simulate the actual game but instead uses the parity of the total number of coins to determine the winner, which aligns with the optimal strategy analysis.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy derived from the game mechanics.
