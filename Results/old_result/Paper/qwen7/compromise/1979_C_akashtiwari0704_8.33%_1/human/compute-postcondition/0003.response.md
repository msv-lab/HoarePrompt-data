Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, and `t` must be greater than 0; `bets` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by taking input as a string, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer. The original values of `t` and `bets` remain unchanged. The list `a` is initialized with the integers obtained from the input string.
