Output State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` must be incremented by 1, `ans` is a string containing the character `str(a[i])` followed by a space and another space, `ans` is updated by adding `str(a[i])` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the string `ans` by appending `str(a[i])` followed by a space to its current value. The variables `i` and `bets` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `i` being equal to `bets` and `bets` needing to be incremented by 1. The string `ans` is now updated to include the character `str(a[i])` followed by a space.
