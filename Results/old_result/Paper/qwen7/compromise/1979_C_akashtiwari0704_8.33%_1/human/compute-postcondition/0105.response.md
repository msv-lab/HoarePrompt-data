Postcondition: **`bets` is at least as large as the total number of iterations in the loop, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations (`bets`), `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each iteration from 0 to `bets-1`, and each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for its respective index, but `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
