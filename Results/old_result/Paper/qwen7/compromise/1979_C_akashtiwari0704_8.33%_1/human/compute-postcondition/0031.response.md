Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `bets`.
   - `bets` is greater than 0.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(bets)` will iterate from `0` to `bets-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `range(bets)` will generate numbers from `0` to `bets-1`, and if `bets` is 0, the range will be empty).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `bets`, the loop will start with `i` equal to `bets`.
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `bets`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1**
