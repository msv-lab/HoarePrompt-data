Output State: `bets` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a string that contains the concatenation of `str(a[i]) + ' '` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `bets` must still be greater than 0 (as it was initially). The variable `ans` will be a single string containing the elements of the list `a` converted to strings and separated by spaces, starting from `a[0]` up to `a[bets-1]`.
