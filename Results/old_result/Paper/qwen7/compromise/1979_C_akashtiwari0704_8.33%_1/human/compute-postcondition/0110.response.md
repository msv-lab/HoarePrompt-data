Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a string that has been appended with `str(a[i])` followed by a space and then `str(a[i+1])` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. Since `ans` was previously a string that had been appended with `str(a[i+1])` followed by a space, now it further appends `str(a[i])` followed by a space. The precondition that `bets` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
