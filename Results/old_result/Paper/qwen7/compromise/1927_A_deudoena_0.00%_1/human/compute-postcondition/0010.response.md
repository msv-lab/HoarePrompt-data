Based on the initial state provided:

- `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'.
- `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
- `outind` is 0.

We need to determine the value of `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

Let's break it down:

1. `len(inpstr)` gives the total length of the string `inpstr`, which is `n`.
2. `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
3. `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.

The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the number of characters between the first and last 'B' in `inpstr`, excluding both the first and last 'B'.

Since the exact positions of `ind1` and `ind2` are not specified, we can only describe the value in terms of these indices.

Output: **n - ind2 - ind1**
