Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, and s, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, and s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B'. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for s.**

In more natural language: The function processes three variables: `t`, `n`, and `s`. `t` is an integer ranging from 1 to 10,000, `n` is an integer ranging from 1 to 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` made up of the characters 'W' (white) and 'B' (black), with the guarantee that `s` contains at least one 'B' (black). The function determines and returns a value based on the content of `s`.
