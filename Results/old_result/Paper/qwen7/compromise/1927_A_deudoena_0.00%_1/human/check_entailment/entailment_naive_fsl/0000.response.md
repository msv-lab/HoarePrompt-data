Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. Specifically, the program only considers the first and last black cells and calculates the distance between them, which does not guarantee the minimum segment length in all cases.

For example, consider the input "WBWBWWWBW". According to the problem description, the correct answer should be 7 because painting the segment from the 2nd to the 8th cell (inclusive) would turn all cells white. However, the program incorrectly outputs 4 because it only considers the distance between the first and last black cells.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible segments and find the minimum length that turns all cells white.
