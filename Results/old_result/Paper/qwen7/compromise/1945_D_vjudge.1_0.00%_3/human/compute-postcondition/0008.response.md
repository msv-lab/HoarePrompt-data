Output State: `soma_b` is 0, `n` is the same input integer, `k` is the same input integer, `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are less than corresponding elements in `lista_A`, and `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

This means that after the loop executes, `soma_b` remains 0 because it is reset to 0 whenever the condition `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` is true. The variable `pref` accumulates the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are less than their corresponding elements in `lista_A`. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged, and `lista_B` retains its original state.
