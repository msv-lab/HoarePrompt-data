Output State: **`soma_b` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `pref` is 0, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**

Explanation: The line `pref = 0` initializes the variable `pref` to 0. This does not affect the values of `soma_b`, `n`, `k`, or `lista_B`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
