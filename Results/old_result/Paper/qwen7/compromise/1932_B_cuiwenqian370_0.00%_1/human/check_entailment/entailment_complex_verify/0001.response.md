### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is designed to process a string consisting of `@` and `*` characters. It does not relate to the calculation of the LCM of periodicities.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads input and calls `func_1` with a string of characters, not integers representing periodicities. This is also unrelated to the problem.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - The expected solution should involve calculating the LCM of the periodicities for each test case.
   - The LCM can be calculated iteratively using the formula `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)` where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.

4. **Correctness of the Provided Code**:
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It processes a string of characters instead of integers representing periodicities and does not calculate the LCM.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code confirms that `func_1` processes a string of characters and does not calculate the LCM of periodicities.
   - `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` with a string, which is incorrect for the problem.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
