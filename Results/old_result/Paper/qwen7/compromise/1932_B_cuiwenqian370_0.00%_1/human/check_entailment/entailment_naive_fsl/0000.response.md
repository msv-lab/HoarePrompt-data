Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, but the given functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to this task. Instead, they seem to be solving a different problem related to paths containing '@' and '*' characters, possibly from a coding challenge like Codeforces or similar platforms.

The functions do not handle the logic required to calculate the year of the apocalypse based on the periodicities of the signs. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
