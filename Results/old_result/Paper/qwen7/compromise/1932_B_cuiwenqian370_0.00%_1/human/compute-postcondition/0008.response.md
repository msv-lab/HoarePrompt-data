Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `result` and it iterates over the `results` list.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. This is because the loop will iterate over each element in the `results` list.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - The `results` list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `result` will take on the value of each element in the `results` list during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case.
- `index` is equal to `t + 2`.
- `results` is a list containing the outputs of `func_1(path)` for each test case.

Since the loop depends on the `results` list, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.

**Final State**:
State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element**
