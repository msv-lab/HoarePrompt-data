Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` elements. The first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', or 0 otherwise. For each subsequent element `dp[i]` (where `i > 0`), it is -inf if the `(i+1)`-th character of `path` is '*', 1 if the `(i+1)`-th character of `path` is '@', or `dp[i-1] + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)` if the `(i+1)`-th character is neither '@' nor '*'.
