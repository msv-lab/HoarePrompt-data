Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads the entire input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `data`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, where `t` represents the number of test cases and `n` represents the number of signs for each test case.
