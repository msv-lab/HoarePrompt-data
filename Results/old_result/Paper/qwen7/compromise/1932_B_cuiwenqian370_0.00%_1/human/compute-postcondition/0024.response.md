Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. The length of `path` is greater than 1. The first element of `dp` is either 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', or 0 otherwise. The second character of `path` is not '*', and the first element of `dp` remains as initially set based on the first character of `path`.
