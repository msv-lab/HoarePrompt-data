Output State: **`path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp` is a list of n zeros with the first element being -inf, and the first character of `path` is '*'.**

Explanation: The code `dp[0] = -float('inf')` changes the value of `dp[0]` from 0 (the initial value) to `-inf`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
