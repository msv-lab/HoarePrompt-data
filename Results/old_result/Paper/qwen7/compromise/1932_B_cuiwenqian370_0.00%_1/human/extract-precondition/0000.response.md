Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, and path is a string containing n space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case.** 

Note: The function `func_1` is not provided, but based on the context, it likely processes the periodicities of the signs to determine the year in which all signs will occur sequentially.
