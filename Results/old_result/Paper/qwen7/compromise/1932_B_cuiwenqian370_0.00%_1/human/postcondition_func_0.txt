The function accepts a string `path` consisting of '@' and '*' characters and returns either 0 or the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. If the string `path` is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a dynamic programming list `dp` where each element depends on the characters in `path`. The final result is the maximum valid value in `dp`.
