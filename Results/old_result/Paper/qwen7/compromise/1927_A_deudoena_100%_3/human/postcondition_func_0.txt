The function processes a binary string `s` (consisting of 'W' and 'B') and calculates a value based on the positions of the first 'B' from the start and the end of the string. Specifically, it returns the length of the string minus the position of the first 'B' from the end, plus 2. This value is returned without any parameters being passed directly to the function.
