Output State: **`removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, `elements` is a list of integers representing the array elements, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the `elements` list and assigns this sum to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
