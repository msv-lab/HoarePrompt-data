Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer such that `n > 1`
   - If `lft[1]` is equal to `lft[0]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[1]`.
   - Otherwise, `sng` is a list with the element `lft[1]` appended to it if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[1]` is not equal to `lft[2]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - The value of `i` needs to be updated to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input parameter and does not change within the loop.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` remains the same (an input integer such that `n > 1`).
   - The conditions for `ldb` and `sng` remain the same as they depend on the values of `lft[0]`, `lft[1]`, and `lft[2]`, which do not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that `n > 1`**.
