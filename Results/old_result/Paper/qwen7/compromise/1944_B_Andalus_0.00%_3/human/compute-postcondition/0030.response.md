Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Analyze the Postcondition**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (`i = i + 1`).
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `ldb` and `sng` are updated based on the value of `lft[i]` relative to `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i+1]`.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ldb` and `sng` are updated based on the condition described. However, since we are asked to provide the state before the update, we keep `ldb` and `sng` as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `ldb` and `sng` are updated as per the previous iteration.**
