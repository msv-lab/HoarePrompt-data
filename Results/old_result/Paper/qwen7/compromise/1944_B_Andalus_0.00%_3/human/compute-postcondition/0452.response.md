Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 1.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, making it one more than its original value which was greater than or equal to `k`. The condition `sz >= k` does not affect the increment operation since the value of `sz` is updated before checking the condition. Therefore, `sz` is now an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 1. All other variables retain their initial state.
