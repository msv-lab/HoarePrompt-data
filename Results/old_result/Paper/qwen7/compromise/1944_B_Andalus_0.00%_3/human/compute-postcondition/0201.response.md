Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements found in `rgt` starting from index 1; `sz` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is initialized to 0. The value of `rdb` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it in the given code snippet. Therefore, `rdb` still contains all consecutive duplicate elements found in `rgt` starting from index 1, and `sz` is now 0.
