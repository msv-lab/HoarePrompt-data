Output State: **`sng` remains the same, `sz` is equal to the previous value of `sz` + 1, `rdb` contains the elements that were printed up to the new value of `sz`, and `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the line into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list named `lst`. The variable `sz` is incremented by 1 because the `map` function processes each element in the input, effectively increasing `sz` by the number of elements in the input. The value of `sng` and the content of `rdb` remain unchanged from the initial state.
