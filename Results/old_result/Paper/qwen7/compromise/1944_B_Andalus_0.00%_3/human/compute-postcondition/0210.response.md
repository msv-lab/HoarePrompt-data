Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is the size of `ldb` and now `sz` is `sz + 2`, `k - sz` is now `k - (sz + 2)`**.

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, making it `sz + 2`. Since `sz` was originally less than `k` and `k - sz` was greater than or equal to 2, after incrementing `sz` by 2, the condition `k - sz` being greater than or equal to 2 still holds true. The contents of `ldb` remain unchanged.
