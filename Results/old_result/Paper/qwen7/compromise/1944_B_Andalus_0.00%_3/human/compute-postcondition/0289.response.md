Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `sng` is not empty. Since `sng` is currently an empty iterable, the loop will not execute at all because there are no elements to iterate over.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop does not execute due to `sng` being empty, there are no changes needed to `elem` (as it is not assigned a value in this loop). However, we need to ensure that `sng` remains an empty iterable for the next iteration, and `sz` should be incremented by 1 as stated in the problem description.

4. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` is still an empty iterable and `sz` has been incremented by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sng` is an empty iterable, `sz` is `sz` + 1**
