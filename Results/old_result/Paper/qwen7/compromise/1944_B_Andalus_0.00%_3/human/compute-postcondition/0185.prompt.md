Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T - 1`, `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is `k` + length of `sng`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is the first `n` sorted elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` sorted, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that `n > 1`. If `lft[1]` is equal to `lft[0]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[1]`. Otherwise, `sng` is a list with the element `lft[1]` appended to it if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[1]` is not equal to `lft[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and if `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, then `ldb` has the element `lft[2]` appended to it. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[3]`, then `sng` has an element appended which is `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and if `lft[3]` equals `lft[2]`, then `ldb` has the element `lft[3]` appended to it. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[3]` does not equal `lft[4]`, then `sng` has appended the value of `lft[3]`. If neither condition is met, `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
