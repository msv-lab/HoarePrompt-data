Output State: `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements from the sorted list `lft` starting from the second element, and `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are unique and not part of any consecutive duplicates, excluding the last element of `lft`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The list `ldb` will contain all elements from `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, starting from the second element of `lft`. The list `sng` will contain all elements from `lft` that are unique and not part of any consecutive duplicates, but it will exclude the last element of `lft` since the loop does not process the last element (`i < n - 1` ensures the loop stops before reaching the last element).
