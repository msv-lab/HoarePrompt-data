Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement mentioned in the initial state. The values of `sng` and `sz` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
