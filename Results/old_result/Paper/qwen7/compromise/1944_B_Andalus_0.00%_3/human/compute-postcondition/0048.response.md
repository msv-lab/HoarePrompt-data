Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[3]` appended with `rgt[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 3, `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends `rgt[3]` to `rdb`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` must still be at least 2, and `rdb` now contains its original value plus the appended `rgt[3]`.
