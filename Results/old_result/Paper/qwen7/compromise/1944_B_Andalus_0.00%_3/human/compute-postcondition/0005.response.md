Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is a sublist of `lst` containing the first `n` elements, `rgt` is a sublist of `lst` containing the remaining elements starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the sublist of `lst` starting from index `n` to `rgt`. This means `rgt` contains all elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
