Output State: **`elem` is the first element of `ldb`, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `elem`, `i`, or `ldb`. It simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `elem` and `i` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
