Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[0]`. `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 1 and the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, which is `rgt[0]`, the list `rdb` now contains `rgt[0]`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
