Based on the initial state provided, `sng` is a non-empty sequence, and the length of `sng` (or `sz`) is equal to `k`. The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly given in the initial state. Since `elem` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value without additional information.

Given the context, we can infer that `elem` refers to an element from the sequence `sng`. But since no specific element is mentioned, we can only say that it is an element from `sng`.

Output: **elem (an element from the sequence sng)**
