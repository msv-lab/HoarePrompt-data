Postcondition: `i` is an integer where `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`. Additionally, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`. If the condition `i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` is not met, the value of `sng` remains unchanged.
