Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list.**

The code `sng = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `sng`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
