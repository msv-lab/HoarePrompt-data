Output State: **`ldb` now contains the element `lft[i]`, `i` is `i_end + 2` and less than `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state, but `i` must still satisfy the condition `i_end + 2 < n` after the code is executed.
