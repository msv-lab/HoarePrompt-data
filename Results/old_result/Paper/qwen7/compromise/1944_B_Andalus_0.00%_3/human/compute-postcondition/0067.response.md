Output State: **`elem` is the second element of `ldb`, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, `elem` remains as the second element of `ldb`, `i` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
