Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `rgt` starting from the second element, and `sz` will be either `k` or less if the loop breaks before `sz` reaches `k` or more.**

Explanation: The loop continues to iterate over the elements of `ldb` until either `sz` reaches `k` or the loop breaks due to `k - sz < 2`. Since the loop does not modify `i`, `i` will be equal to `n` after all iterations. The variable `rdb` is described as containing all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `rgt` starting from the second element, which means it will contain duplicates of subsequent elements in `rgt`. The variable `sz` will be `k` if the loop completes without breaking early, or it will be less than `k` if the loop breaks before `sz` can reach `k`.
