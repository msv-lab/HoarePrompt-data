Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is equal to `k`.
- `sng` has had its first element printed `sz` times, making `sng` now equal to `k`.
- `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` as per the initial conditions.

The `print()` statement simply prints an empty line. Since no specific value or content is specified to be printed, the output will be an empty line.

Output: **Output a blank line**
