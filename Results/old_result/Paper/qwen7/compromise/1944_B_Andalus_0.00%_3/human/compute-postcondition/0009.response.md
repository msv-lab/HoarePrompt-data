Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is a sublist of `lst` containing the first `n` elements sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a sublist of `lst` containing the remaining elements starting from index `n`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**

The code `lft.sort()` sorts the sublist `lft` in ascending order. Since `lft` originally contains the first `n` elements of `lst`, after sorting, these elements are in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
