Output State: **`sng` remains the same, `sz` is equal to the previous value of `sz` + 1, and `rdb` contains the elements that were printed up to the new value of `sz` with `n` and `k` being integers inputted by the user.**

This means that the variables `sng` and `rdb` remain unchanged from their initial states, `sz` is incremented by 1, and `n` and `k` are set to the integer values inputted by the user.
