Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 0 (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is the number of elements in `sng`.
   - `rdb` is an empty list (not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `sz` is 1 (not directly relevant to the loop head).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `sng`. At the start of the first iteration, `elem` will be the first element of `sng`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the start of the previous iteration, `elem` will now be the first element of `sng`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it is the length of `sng`, which does not change within the loop.
   - `rdb` and `sz` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` is still the number of elements in `sng`.
   - `rdb` is still an empty list.
   - `sz` is still 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 1**.
