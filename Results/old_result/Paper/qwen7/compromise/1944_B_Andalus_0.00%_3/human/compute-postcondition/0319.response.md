Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the condition `lft[i] != lft[i - 1]` holds true; additionally, the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`; `sng` now contains the element `lft[i]` appended to it.**

This means that the list `sng` has had the element `lft[i]` added to it, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged.
