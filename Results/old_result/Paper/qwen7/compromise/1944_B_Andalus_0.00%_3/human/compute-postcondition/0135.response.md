Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty sequence, the length of `sng` (or `sz`) is equal to `k`, and the length of `sng` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `sng`, `k`, or `sz`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently in. Therefore, the lengths and properties of `sng` remain unchanged, and we simply note that the execution breaks out of the relevant loop or conditional structure.
