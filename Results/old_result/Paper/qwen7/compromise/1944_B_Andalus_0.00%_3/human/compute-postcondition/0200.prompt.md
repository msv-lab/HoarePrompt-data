Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `lft` starting from index 1, and `sng` is a list containing all unique elements found in `lft` starting from index 1, excluding any duplicates.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. During each iteration, the loop checks if the current element `lft[i]` is equal to the previous element `lft[i-1]`. If they are equal, the current element is added to `ldb`. If the current element is not equal to the next element `lft[i+1]`, it is added to `sng`. This process continues until the loop finishes, resulting in `ldb` containing all consecutive duplicates starting from index 1 and `sng` containing all unique elements (excluding duplicates) starting from index 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i]` appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i - 1]` appended, and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i]` appended, and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
