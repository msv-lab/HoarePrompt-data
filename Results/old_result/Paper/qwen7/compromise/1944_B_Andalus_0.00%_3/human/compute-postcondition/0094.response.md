Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 2, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
