Output State: **`sz` is an integer, `sng` has had its first element printed 0 times, `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block mentioned in the initial state, the only effect is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. The values of `sz`, `sng`, and `ldb` remain unchanged. The `elem` variable is not affected by the `break` statement.
