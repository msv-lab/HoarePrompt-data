Output State: **`ldb` is a non-empty list, and the size of `ldb` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `sz` is increased by 2**.

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 2. The size of the list `ldb` remains unchanged from its previous state since no operation directly modifies the list itself. Therefore, the size of `ldb` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
