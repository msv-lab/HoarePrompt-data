Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `elem` which iterates over the sequence `sng`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `sng` is a non-empty sequence.
   - The length of `sng` (or `sz`) is equal to `k` + 1.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `sng`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `sng`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element. Since `sng` is a sequence and it was non-empty at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain non-empty until all its elements have been processed.

5. **Update the State**: After processing one element from `sng`, `sng` will now be a sequence that is one element shorter than it was before. However, since `sng` was non-empty and had a length of `k` + 1, removing one element will leave it with a length of `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` is still a non-empty sequence but now has a length of `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sng` is a non-empty sequence, and the length of `sng` (or `sz`) is equal to `k`**
