Output State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `sz` and `rdb`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional was specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the values of `sz` and `rdb` remain unchanged, and the break statement indicates that we have exited the innermost control structure.
