Postcondition: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`. If the condition `sz >= k` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, and all other variables retain their initial state. If the condition `sz >= k` is false, no action is taken and all other variables retain their initial state.**
