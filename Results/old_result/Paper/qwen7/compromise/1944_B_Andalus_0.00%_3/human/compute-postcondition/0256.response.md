Output State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz` or `rdb`. It only causes the loop or conditional block it is inside to terminate. Since the condition `sz >= k` was true before the `break`, it implies that `sz` was already greater than or equal to `k`, but the values of `sz` and `rdb` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `sz` and `rdb`, along with the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
