Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty collection, the first element of `sng` is `elem`, `sz` is an integer less than `k`, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sng`, `elem`, `sz`, or `k`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
