Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the number of elements in `sng`.
- `rdb` is an empty list.
- `sz` is 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement is trying to print the value of `elem`. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since no other context or information about `elem` is provided, we cannot determine its value from the given information.

Therefore, the output will be a placeholder indicating that the value of `elem` is unknown.

Output: **elem**
