Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It returns information based on the values of n and k, where n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 represents the number of test cases.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but works with a list of integers and process it according to the given constraints for n, k, and t.
