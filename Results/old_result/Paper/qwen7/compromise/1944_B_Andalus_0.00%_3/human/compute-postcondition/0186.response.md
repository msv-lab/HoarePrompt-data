Output State: `i` is `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `lft` starting from index 1, and `sng` is a list containing all unique elements found in `lft` starting from index 1, excluding any duplicates.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. During each iteration, the loop checks if the current element `lft[i]` is equal to the previous element `lft[i-1]`. If they are equal, the current element is added to `ldb`. If the current element is not equal to the next element `lft[i+1]`, it is added to `sng`. This process continues until the loop finishes, resulting in `ldb` containing all consecutive duplicates starting from index 1 and `sng` containing all unique elements (excluding duplicates) starting from index 1.
