Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is the size of `ldb`.
- The value of `sz` is less than `k` because `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

This means that `sz` is at least 1 but less than `k`, and specifically, `k - sz` is at least 2. However, the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state. Since `ldb` contains at least one element, we can assume `elem` refers to one of the elements in `ldb`.

Given this, the print statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` will print the same value of `elem` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **elem elem**
