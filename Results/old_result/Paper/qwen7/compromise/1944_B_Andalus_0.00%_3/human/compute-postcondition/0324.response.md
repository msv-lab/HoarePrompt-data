Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.

4. **Calculate the new values**:
   - Since `i` was at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote its value as `i_end`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

5. **Check the loop condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1` and this value should still be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` must be `i_end + 1` and less than `n`**.
