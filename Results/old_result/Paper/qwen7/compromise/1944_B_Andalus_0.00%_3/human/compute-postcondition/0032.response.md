Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `ldb` and `sng` are updated as per the previous iteration, `sng` list has appended the value of `lft[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is already `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, and `ldb` and `sng` are updated as per the previous iteration, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `sng` now includes the value of `lft[i]`.
