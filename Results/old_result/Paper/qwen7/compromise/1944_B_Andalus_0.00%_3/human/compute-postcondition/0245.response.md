Output State: **`sz` is `sz` + 1, `sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz`, `sng`, or `elem`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
