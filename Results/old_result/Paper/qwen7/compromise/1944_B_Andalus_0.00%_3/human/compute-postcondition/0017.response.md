Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`; additionally, `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `sng` now contains the element `lft[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, so `lft[i]` is `lft[1]`. Since `sng` was initially empty, after appending `lft[1]`, `sng` now contains `lft[1]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
