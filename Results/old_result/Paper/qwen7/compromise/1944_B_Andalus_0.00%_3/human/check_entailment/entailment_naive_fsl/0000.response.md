Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

Expected output:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```

or any permutation of these values that satisfies the conditions.

However, the program outputs:
```
1 2
3 4
```

This is incorrect because the XOR of `[1, 2]` is `3`, and the XOR of `[3, 4]` is `7`, which do not match. Therefore, the program does not always produce valid outputs according to the problem description.
