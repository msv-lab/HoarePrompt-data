Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of `sng` List**: The `sng` list is used to store unique elements in the left half (`lft`). However, this list is not utilized correctly to form the required subsets `l` and `r`. The logic to use these unique elements is flawed.

2. **Subset Formation**: The code attempts to form subsets `l` and `r` using elements from `ldb` and `rdb`, but it doesn't ensure that the XOR values of the subsets are equal. The approach to forming the subsets is overly simplistic and doesn't guarantee the correct XOR result.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the elements in `ldb` and `rdb` are not sufficient to form the required subsets `l` and `r`.

4. **Incorrect Logic for XOR Equality**: The logic to ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r` is missing. The current implementation does not guarantee that the XOR values will be equal.

### Correct Approach:
A more robust approach would involve:
- Using a frequency count to identify pairs of elements that can be used to balance the XOR values.
- Ensuring that the subsets `l` and `r` are formed such that their XOR values are equal.

Here's a revised version of the function with a more correct approach:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Frequency count of elements
        freq = [0] * (n + 1)
        for num in lst:
            freq[num] += 1
        
        # Initialize subsets
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # Forming subsets
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if freq[i] % 2 == 1:
                l.append(i)
                r.append(i)
                freq[i] -= 2
            if len(l) == 2 * k:
                break
        
        # Ensure remaining elements are distributed
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            while freq[i] > 0:
                if len(l) < 2 * k:
                    l.append(i)
                    freq[i] -= 1
                else:
                    r.append(i)
                    freq[i] -= 1
        
        # Output subsets
        print(' '.join(map(str, l)))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r)))

func()
```

This revised solution ensures that the subsets `l` and `r` are formed such that their XOR values are equal by leveraging the frequency count of elements.
