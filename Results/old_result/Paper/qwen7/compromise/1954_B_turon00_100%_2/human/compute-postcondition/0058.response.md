Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is either 2 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, or 0 if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. The values of `a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their previous states. The updated value of `ans` depends on the current values of `ans` and `cnt`.
