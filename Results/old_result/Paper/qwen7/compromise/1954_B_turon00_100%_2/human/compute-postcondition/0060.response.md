Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, or reset to 0 if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`. In both cases, `ans` remains the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.
