Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `t`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array `a`. If the array has only one element or the minimum count is equal to `n`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the minimum count. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is decremented to 0 and all other variables are in their expected final states.**
