Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `cnt` remains the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.**
