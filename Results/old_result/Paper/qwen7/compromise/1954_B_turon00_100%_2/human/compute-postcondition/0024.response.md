Output State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and 1.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `ans` is not directly modified by this line of code, but since it is defined as the minimum value between its current value and 1, and `cnt` is now 0, the value of `ans` remains unchanged as well.
