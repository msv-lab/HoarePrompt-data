Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is less than `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is 2, `cnt` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. Since `ans` was previously calculated as `cnt + 1` and `cnt` was 1, `ans` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
