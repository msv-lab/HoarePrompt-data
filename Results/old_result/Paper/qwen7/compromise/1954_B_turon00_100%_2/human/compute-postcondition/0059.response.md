Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This updates the value of `cnt` without affecting the other variables. The initial conditions for `a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged except that `cnt` is now explicitly set to 0.
