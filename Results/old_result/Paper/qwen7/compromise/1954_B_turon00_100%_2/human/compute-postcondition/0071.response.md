Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans`, `cnt`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is now an integer obtained from user input.
