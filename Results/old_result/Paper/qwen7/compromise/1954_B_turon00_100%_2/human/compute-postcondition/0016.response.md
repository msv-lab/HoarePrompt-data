Output State: **`i` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 1 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 0, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for updating `ans` based on `a[1]` and `tmp` is still valid and will be checked later in the program.
