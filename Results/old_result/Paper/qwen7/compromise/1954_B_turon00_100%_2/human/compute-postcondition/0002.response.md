Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition of being greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
