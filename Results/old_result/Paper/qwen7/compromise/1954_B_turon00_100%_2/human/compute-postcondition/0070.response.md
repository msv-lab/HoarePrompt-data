Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - The condition `(n != 1 and ans != n)` holds true.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`a`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans`, `cnt`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1**.
