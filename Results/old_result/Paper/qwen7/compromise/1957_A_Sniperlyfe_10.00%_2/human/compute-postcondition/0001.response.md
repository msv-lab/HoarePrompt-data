Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `n`, which is being iterated over in the list `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The variable `n` takes on the value of each element in the list during each iteration.

3. **Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute**:
   - The list `arr` is given as a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks.
   - The variable `n` is being used to iterate over this list.
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element (since the loop iterates over each element in the list).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `arr` is a list of integers, and the loop will execute as long as `arr` is not empty, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element.
   - The variable `n` will take on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration, but since we don't know the specific values of the elements, we just need to ensure that the list is not empty.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `arr` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
