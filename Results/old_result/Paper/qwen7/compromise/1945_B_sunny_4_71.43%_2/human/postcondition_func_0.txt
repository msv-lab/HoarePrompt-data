The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates \(A\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1\) and \(B\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\), then prints the sum \(A + B\). After processing all test cases, it outputs the sum for each case.
