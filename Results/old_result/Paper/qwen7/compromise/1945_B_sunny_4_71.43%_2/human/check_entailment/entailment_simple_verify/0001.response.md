### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the intervals during which fireworks from both installations overlap in visibility.
   - The key observation is that the number of fireworks visible from each installation over a period of `m` minutes is approximately `m / a` and `m / b`, respectively. Adding 1 accounts for the inclusion of the initial launch time.

3. **Calculation:**
   - For the first installation, the number of fireworks visible within `m` minutes is `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - For the second installation, the number of fireworks visible within `m` minutes is `int(m / b) + 1`.

4. **Overlap Consideration:**
   - The formula provided in the code directly sums these values without considering any overlap between the two installations. However, the problem statement does not explicitly mention any specific constraints or overlaps beyond the visibility period. The provided solution assumes that the overlap is negligible or handled implicitly by the visibility period.

5. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks from each installation using the given formulas.
   - It sums these values and prints the result.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles large values of `a`, `b`, and `m` within the given constraints (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18).
   - The logic is straightforward and does not require complex calculations or additional checks for overlap beyond the visibility period.

However, there is a critical flaw in the original assessment. The calculation of the number of fireworks visible from each installation using `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` does not account for the actual overlap in visibility periods. This approach assumes that the fireworks from both installations are evenly distributed and do not overlap, which is not necessarily true.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
- The first installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 6, 12, 18 (but only the first and last are visible within 4 minutes).
- The second installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 7, 14 (but only the first and last are visible within 4 minutes).
- The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2, but the code would incorrectly calculate it as `int(4 / 6) + 1 + int(4 / 7) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct in this specific case but may fail in other cases due to the lack of consideration for actual overlap.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is overly optimistic and does not fully address the potential for overlap in the visibility periods.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is not entirely correct because it does not account for the actual overlap in the visibility periods of the fireworks from both installations. While it works correctly in some cases, it may fail in others.

### Final:
**False**
