Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` but does not account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which fireworks from both installations coincide. The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would then be the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`, minus the overlap (fireworks that coincide due to the LCM).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within m minutes
        A = (m // a) + 1
        B = (m // b) + 1
        
        # Calculate the LCM of a and b
        l = lcm(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of coinciding fireworks
        C = (m // l) + 1
        
        # Maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously
        max_visible = A + B - C
        
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected program properly accounts for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations.
