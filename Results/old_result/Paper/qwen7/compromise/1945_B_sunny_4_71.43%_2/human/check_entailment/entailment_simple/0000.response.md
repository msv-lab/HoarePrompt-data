Reasoning:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The key insight here is that the number of fireworks visible at any given time is determined by how often the intervals of visibility overlap. Specifically, for each test case, we need to calculate how many fireworks are launched within the visibility period \(m\) for each installation and then sum these values.

However, the given solution does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The current implementation calculates \(A\) and \(B\) as follows:
- \(A = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1\)
- \(B = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\)

These values represent the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period \(m\). However, they do not account for the simultaneous launches of fireworks from both installations, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To find the correct solution, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), because the simultaneous launches occur at multiples of the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\). The correct approach involves calculating the number of intervals of length \(a\) and \(b\) that fit into \(m\), and then adding the number of simultaneous launches.

Given the current implementation, the solution is incorrect because it does not properly account for the simultaneous launches of fireworks from both installations.

Correctness: **False**
