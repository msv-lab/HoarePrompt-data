Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Instead, it counts the occurrences of the median value in the sorted array, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 2 8
```
The program will output `1`, but the correct output should be `1` as explained in the example in the problem statement. However, the program will also give the same output for arrays like `[2, 2, 9]`, where the median is already 2, and no operations are needed to increase it to 3.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to find the difference between the current median and the next greater number in the sorted array, and then calculate how many operations are needed to make all elements up to the median position equal to this next greater number. This ensures the median is increased to the next possible value.
