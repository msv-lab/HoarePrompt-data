Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current implementation counts the occurrences of the median value in the sorted array but does not actually perform any operations to increase the median. 

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the difference between the median value and the smallest value in the array that is greater than or equal to the median. We then need to count how many such operations are required to make the median the smallest value among these candidates.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        median_index = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median_value = a[median_index]
        
        # Find the smallest value greater than or equal to the median
        smallest_greater_value = min([val for val in a if val >= median_value], default=median_value)
        
        # Count the number of operations needed
        operations = sum(1 for val in a if val == median_value) + (smallest_greater_value - median_value) * (a.count(median_value))
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected function will properly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
