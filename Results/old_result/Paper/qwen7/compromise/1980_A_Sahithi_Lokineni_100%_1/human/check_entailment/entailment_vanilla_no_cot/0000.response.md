Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it uses `default_value` which is not defined anywhere in the code. Additionally, the logic for counting the required problems is flawed. It assumes that each difficulty level needs to be available at least `m` times, but it doesn't correctly handle the scenario where some difficulties might be sufficient for fewer than `m` rounds.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    d = defaultdict(int)
    for char in s:
        d[char] += 1
    
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        needed = m - d.get(val, 0)
        if needed > 0:
            ans += needed
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version initializes the dictionary `d` with default integer values, counts the occurrences of each difficulty level, and calculates the number of additional problems needed for each level that is insufficient for `m` rounds.
