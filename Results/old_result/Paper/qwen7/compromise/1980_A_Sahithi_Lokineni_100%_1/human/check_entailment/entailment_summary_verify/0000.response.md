### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It also reads a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Dictionary Initialization:**
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized using `defaultdict(int)`, which means it will default to 0 for any key that doesn't exist yet.
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and counts the occurrences of each difficulty level.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
   - For each difficulty level in the dictionary, if the count is less than `m`, the program adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but is not used in the main program. It always returns 0, which is irrelevant to the problem.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Dictionary Initialization:** The use of `defaultdict(int)` is correct, ensuring that all keys have a default value of 0.
- **Counting Occurrences:** The loop to count the occurrences of each difficulty level is correct.
- **Calculating Additional Problems:** The logic to calculate the additional problems needed is correct. The program ensures that each difficulty level has at least `m` problems by adding `m - d[val]` if the current count is less than `m`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed. The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues but provided a misleading correction. The provided correction was unnecessary and incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
