Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, inf):
    sum_value_digits = 0
    for x in str(i):
        sum_value_digits += int(x)
    values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, and `sum_value_digits` contains the sum of all digits in the final value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers, and `sum_value_digits` holds the same sum of these integer values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers; `sum_value_digits` is the total sum of `int(x)` for every character `x` in the string `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
