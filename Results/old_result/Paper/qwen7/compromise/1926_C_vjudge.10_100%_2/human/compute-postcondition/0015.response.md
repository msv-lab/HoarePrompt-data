Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in str(i):`. The objects involved here are `x` and `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is a character from the string representation of `i`.
   - `i` is an integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will iterate over each character in the string representation of `i`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` is a non-empty string.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is a character from the string representation of `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is a non-empty string. If `i` were an empty string, the loop would not execute.
   - The value of `sum_value_digits` being 0 or the initial value of `values[i]` being set to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits` does not affect the execution of this specific loop because the loop only depends on `i`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `i` must be a non-empty string.

**State: **`i` must be a non-empty string**
