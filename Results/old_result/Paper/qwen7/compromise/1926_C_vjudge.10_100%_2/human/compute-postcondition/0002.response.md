Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list named `values` with 200001 elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `inf`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and the new list `values` is created with the specified length and initial values.
