Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `inf`. The only variable that can be adjusted here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (as specified in the range function `range(1, inf)`).

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `inf`. Since `inf` is a constant value (200001), the loop will keep running until `i` reaches or exceeds this value.

4. **Adjust the State**: Given that `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < inf`, the initial state of `i` should be set to 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `inf`, and `values`) do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being set to 1.

**State: **`i` is 1**
