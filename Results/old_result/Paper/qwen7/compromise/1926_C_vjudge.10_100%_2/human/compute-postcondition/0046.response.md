Output State: **The final state of `values` will contain the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200000 for each index from 0 to 200000.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `values` list will have 200001 elements, where each element `values[i]` (for `i` ranging from 0 to 200000) represents the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`. For instance, `values[1]` will be 1, `values[2]` will be 3, `values[3]` will be 6, and so forth, up to `values[200000]`, which will be the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to 200000.
