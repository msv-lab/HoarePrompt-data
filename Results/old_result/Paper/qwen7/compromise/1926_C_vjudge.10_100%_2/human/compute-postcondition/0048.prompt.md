You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `values` will be a list where each index `i` (from 0 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. In other words, `values[i]` will hold the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`. This means that for each index `i` in the `values` list, it will store the result of summing the digits of all numbers from 1 up to `i`.
    #
    #For example, `values[1]` will be 1 (since the digit sum of 1 is 1), `values[2]` will be 3 (since the digit sum of 1+2 is 3), `values[3]` will be 6 (since the digit sum of 1+2+3 is 6), and so on, until `values[200000]`, which will be the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to 200000.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: The final state of `values` will contain the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200000 for each index from 0 to 200000.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. The function does not return any value directly but seems to handle or process these integers based on their ranges.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
