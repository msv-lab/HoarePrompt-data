Output State: **`values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, and `sum_value_digits` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `sum_value_digits = 0` sets the value of `sum_value_digits` to 0. The initial state of `values[i]` being equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits` remains unchanged because `sum_value_digits` was previously calculated and stored. After setting `sum_value_digits` to 0, its new value is 0.
