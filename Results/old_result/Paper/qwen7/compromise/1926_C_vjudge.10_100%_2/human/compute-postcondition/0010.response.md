Output State: **`sum_value_digits` is the original value plus twice the integer value of the next character in the string representation of `i`; `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` adds the integer value of `x` to `sum_value_digits`. Since `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`, its value remains unchanged. The updated value of `sum_value_digits` is the original value plus the integer value of `x`.
