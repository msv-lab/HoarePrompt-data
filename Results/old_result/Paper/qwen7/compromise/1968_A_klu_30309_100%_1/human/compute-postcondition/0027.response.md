Output State: **`max_sum` is `gcd_val + (y-1)`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` retains its original value, `y` is decremented by 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y-1), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain as they were before the statement was executed.
