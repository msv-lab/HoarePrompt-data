Output State: The loop will continue iterating over each value of `x` from the `test_cases` list. For each `x`, it will iterate through all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1. During each iteration, it calculates `gcd_val` as `math.gcd(x, y)` and `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, and `best_y` is updated to `y`. The loop breaks immediately after updating these values.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final output state will be:
- `max_sum` will hold the maximum value of `current_sum` found across all `x` and `y` pairs.
- `best_y` will hold the corresponding `y` value that produced the maximum `current_sum`.
- The `results` list will contain 1, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.
- `gcd_val` will be the last calculated greatest common divisor (GCD) of the last `x` and `y` pair that was processed before the loop terminated.
- `x` will be the last value from the `test_cases` list that was processed.

In summary, the loop processes each `x` from the `test_cases` list, finds the `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y`, and updates `max_sum` and `best_y` accordingly. After processing all `x` values, the final `max_sum` and `best_y` reflect the overall maximum sum and corresponding `y` value found across all iterations.
