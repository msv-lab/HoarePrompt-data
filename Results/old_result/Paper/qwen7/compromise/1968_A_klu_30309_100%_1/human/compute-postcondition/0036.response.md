Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `results` list contains 1, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function. However, since the value of `y` is not specified, the GCD is represented as `math.gcd(x, y)`. The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
