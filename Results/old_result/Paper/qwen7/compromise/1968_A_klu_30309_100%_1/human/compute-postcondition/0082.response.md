Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y**.

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to `gcd_val + y`. Given that `y` is `x - 3`, and `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, the new value of `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
