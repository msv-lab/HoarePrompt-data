Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `gcd_val + (y - 1)`, `best_y` is equal to `y - 1`, `x` retains its original value, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `y` is `y - 1**.

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` updates the value of `best_y` to be the current value of `y`. All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
