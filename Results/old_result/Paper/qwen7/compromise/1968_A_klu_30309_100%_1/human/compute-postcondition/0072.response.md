Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `y` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains unchanged.
   - `best_y` is `x - 1`.
   - The `results` list now contains 1.
   - `gcd_val` is unchanged.
   - `x` is the next value from `test_cases`.
   - `y` is `x - 1`.
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `y` starts from `x - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `y` will be `y - 1`.
   - `x` will remain the same for the next iteration since it is the next value from `test_cases`.
   - `max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`, `gcd_val` will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

Given these points, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `y` will be `x - 1 - 1` (i.e., `y - 1`).
- `x` will remain the same.
- `max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`, `gcd_val` will remain unchanged.

So, the updated states are:

State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains unchanged. `best_y` is `x - 1`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)**

Note: The exact value of `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, but since `current_sum` was previously `gcd_val + (x - 1)`, the new value of `current_sum` will be `gcd_val + (x - 2)` after decrementing `y` by 1.
