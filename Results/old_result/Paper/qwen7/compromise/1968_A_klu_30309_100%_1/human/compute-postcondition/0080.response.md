Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined by the `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `y` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will continue as long as `y` is within the range specified by `range(x - 1, 0, -1)`. This means `y` should be a value from `x-1` down to `1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`.
   - `best_y` is `x - 2`.
   - The `results` list now contains 1.
   - `gcd_val` remains unchanged.
   - `x` is the next value from `test_cases`.
   - `y` is `x - 2`.
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `y` starting from `x-1` down to `1`, the next value of `y` would be `x-3` (assuming the loop has already executed once with `y = x-2`).
   - `x` will remain the same since it is the next value from `test_cases` and hasn't changed yet.
   - All other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`, `gcd_val`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` remains unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)**
