Output State: **`max_sum` is now `gcd_val + (y-1)`, `best_y` remains unchanged, `x` retains its original value, `y` is decremented by 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y-1)**.

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates `max_sum` to the current value of `current_sum`. Since `current_sum` is defined as `gcd_val + (y-1)`, `max_sum` is now set to this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
