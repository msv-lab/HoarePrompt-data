Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y, `best_y` is `x - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, all the variables retain their previous values. We also note that the execution breaks out of the loop or conditional structure.
