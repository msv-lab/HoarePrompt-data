Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is still 1, `results` list contains 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and it is greater than `max_sum`.**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be the same as the current value of `current_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
