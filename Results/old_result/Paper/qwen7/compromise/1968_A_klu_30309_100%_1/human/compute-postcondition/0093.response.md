Output State: **The program returns a list of best_y values, where each best_y is the largest integer less than the corresponding x in test_cases such that the sum of the GCD of x and best_y plus best_y is maximized.**

This means that for each `x` in `test_cases`, the program finds the `best_y` which is the largest integer smaller than `x` that maximizes the sum of the GCD of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y`. The resulting list of these `best_y` values is returned.
