Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, the `results` list now contains 1, and `gcd_val` is unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The variable `best_y` is directly assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `max_sum` remains 0, `best_y` is now 1, the `results` list contains only the value 1, and `gcd_val` and `x` remain unchanged.
