Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is unchanged, the `results` list now contains only `best_y`, and `gcd_val` is unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = 0` sets the variable `max_sum` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `best_y`, the `results` list, `gcd_val`, or `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values.
