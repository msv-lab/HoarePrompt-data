Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` remains unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. All the other variables retain their previous values.
