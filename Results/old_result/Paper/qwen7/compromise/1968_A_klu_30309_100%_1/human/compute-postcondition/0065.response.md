Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases` (a positive integer), `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is calculated as `math.gcd(x, y)**.

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function. Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, the GCD of `x` and `x - 1` is always 1 for any positive integer `x`. Therefore, `gcd_val` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
