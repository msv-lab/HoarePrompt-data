Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for x in test_cases:
    max_sum = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
        current_sum = gcd_val + y
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            best_y = y
            break
    results.append(best_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has completed all its iterations; `max_sum` holds the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration, `best_y` stores the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`; `results` list is appended with `best_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max_sum` is the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration of the loop, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that produced this maximum sum, the `results` list now contains `best_y`, and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `best_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max_sum` will hold the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during all iterations of the loop, `best_y` will be the corresponding `y` value that produced this maximum sum, the `results` list will remain unchanged at `[1]`, `gcd_val` is the GCD of the last `x` and `best_y` found, and `results.append(best_y)` has been executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
