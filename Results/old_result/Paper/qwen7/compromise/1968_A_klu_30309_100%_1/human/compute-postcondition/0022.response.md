Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `y` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `y` by 1 each iteration.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_sum` remains unchanged.
   - `best_y` remains unchanged.
   - `x` retains its original value.
   - `current_sum` and `y` are not mentioned in the initial state but are part of the loop body.

4. **Analyze what happens inside the loop**:
   - The loop updates `max_sum` and `best_y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.
   - If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.
   - `y` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` retains its original value, it remains unchanged.
   - `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged unless they were updated in the loop body during the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `max_sum` remains unchanged.
- `best_y` remains unchanged.
- `x` retains its original value.
- `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`max_sum` remains unchanged, `best_y` remains unchanged, `x` retains its original value, `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
