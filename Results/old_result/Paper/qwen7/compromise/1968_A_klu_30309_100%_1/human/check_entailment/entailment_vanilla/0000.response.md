Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `x` for each test case.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(t, test_cases)` is defined to process each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - It iterates over each `x` in `test_cases`.

3. **Finding the Best `y`:**
   - For each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
   - It computes the sum `current_sum = gcd_val + y`.
   - If this `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`. It also breaks out of the loop since we only need the first such `y` that maximizes the sum.
   - After finding the best `y` for the current `x`, it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints each element in `results` after processing all test cases.
   - This part is correct.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- For `x = 10`:
  - Possible `y` values are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
  - GCD calculations and sums:
    - GCD(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10
    - GCD(10, 8) + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10
    - GCD(10, 7) + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8
    - GCD(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8
    - GCD(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10
    - GCD(10, 4) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6
    - GCD(10, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4
    - GCD(10, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4
    - GCD(10, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
  - The maximum sum is 10, achieved by `y = 5` or `y = 8` (both give the same sum). The program will choose the first one, which is `5`.

- Similarly, for other values of `x`, the logic holds true.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the value of `y` that maximizes the sum `gcd(x, y) + y` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
