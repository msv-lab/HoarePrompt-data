Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the integer \( y \) for each \( x \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and the values of \( x \) for each test case.
2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each \( x \) in `test_cases`.
   - For each \( x \), it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
   - For each \( y \), it calculates the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - If the current sum of the GCD and \( y \) is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current \( y \). The loop breaks immediately after finding the first such \( y \) to ensure the maximum sum is found.
   - After processing all \( y \) for the current \( x \), it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.
3. **Output**: The function returns the list of `best_y` values, which are printed out in the main program.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs. The provided example input and output match the expected behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
