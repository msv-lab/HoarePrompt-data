Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the input number `num`. It iterates over the characters of the string in reverse, counting zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit. The function then returns the count of trailing zeros. The additional assignment of `i` to `-1` after the loop is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the function.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and initializes an array to store the answers.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the list of integers.
   - It calculates the total number of digits in the list and identifies the positions of trailing zeros using `func_1`.
   - The program sorts the positions of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It then iteratively subtracts the largest available trailing zeros in pairs (if possible) and keeps track of the total reduction in the number of trailing zeros (`subtract_zero`).
   - Finally, it checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the reduced number of trailing zeros is at least `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and edge cases where the number of digits and the positions of trailing zeros are considered.
   - The program ensures that Sasha wins if the condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is met, which aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the winner for each test case as required.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to implement the logic correctly according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
