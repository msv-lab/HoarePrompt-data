You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

        if num[i] == '0':

    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are still characters in `num` that are '0' from the end of the string. After all iterations, `counter` will hold the total count of '0's from the end of `num` until it encounters a non-zero digit. If `num` consists entirely of '0's, `counter` will equal the length of `num`. If `num` does not contain any '0's, `counter` will be 0. The variable `i` will be set to -1 after the loop ends, indicating that the loop has completed all possible iterations.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `counter` variable will hold the number of trailing zeros in the integer `num` (if `num` is represented as a string). The `i` variable will be -1, signifying the end of the loop.
    return counter
    #The program returns the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`, and `i` is set to -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts an integer `num` within the range of 1 to 10^9. It counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num` and returns this count. Additionally, after the function executes, the variable `i` is set to -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an empty list `answers` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers as strings (since they are split by spaces).

3. **Calculating Total Digits:**
   - It calculates the total number of digits in the list by summing the lengths of the string representations of the integers.

4. **Counting Leading Zeros:**
   - It defines a helper function `func_1` that counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string.
   - It applies this function to each integer in the list and stores the count of zeros in a list called `zeros`.

5. **Sorting and Processing Zeros:**
   - It sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It iterates over the sorted `zeros` list in steps of 2 and accumulates the sum of every second element starting from the first element (index 0).

6. **Determining the Winner:**
   - It checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the accumulated zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If true, it sets the answer for the current test case to 'Sashah' (which should be 'Sasha').
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to 'Anna'.

7. **Outputting Results:**
   - Finally, it prints the answers for all test cases.

### Issues Identified

1. **Function Name Mismatch:**
   - The function name in the code is `func_1`, but the problem statement mentions `func_1` is not defined. This is likely a typo and should be `func_0` or another name.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic to determine the winner is flawed. The problem requires checking if Sasha can force the final number to be at least \(10^m\). The current implementation does not correctly simulate the game's rules and does not account for the strategic aspects of the game.

3. **Incorrect Use of `subtract_zero`:**
   - The variable `subtract_zero` is used to accumulate the sum of every second element in the sorted `zeros` list. This does not reflect the actual game strategy and does not help in determining the winner.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the game's rules and determine the optimal moves for both players. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Moves:**
   - Simulate Anna's and Sasha's moves to see if Sasha can force a win.
   - Use a dynamic programming or game theory approach to determine the winning strategy.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Anna can always reverse numbers to minimize the final number.
   - Sasha can concatenate numbers to maximize the final number.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
