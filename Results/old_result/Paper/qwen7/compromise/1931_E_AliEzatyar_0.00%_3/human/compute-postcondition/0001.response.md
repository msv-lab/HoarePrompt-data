Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `counter` is 0 (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `num` is an integer where \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `len(num) - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.
   - This means `i` will take values from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `num` must be a valid integer within the specified range.
   - The variable `i` should start at `len(num) - 1` and decrement until it reaches `-1`.

5. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - Since `num` is already given as an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), no adjustment is needed for `num`.
   - `i` should start at `len(num) - 1`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `num` is an integer where \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).
- `i` should start at `len(num) - 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num` is an integer where \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
