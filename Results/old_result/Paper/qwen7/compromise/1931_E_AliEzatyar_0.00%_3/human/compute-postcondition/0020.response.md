Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are still digits in `num` that are '0' from the end of the number towards the beginning. After all iterations, `counter` will hold the total count of trailing zeros in `num`. If `num` does not contain any trailing zeros, `counter` will be 0. The variable `i` will be set to -1 after the loop finishes, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The value of `num` remains unchanged throughout the process.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:
- `counter`: The total number of trailing zeros in `num`.
- `i`: -1 (indicating the loop has completed).
- `num`: Unchanged from the initial state.
