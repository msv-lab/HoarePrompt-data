Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is a set containing the element `a[1]`, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[1]` (since `j` is 1) to the set `extra`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
