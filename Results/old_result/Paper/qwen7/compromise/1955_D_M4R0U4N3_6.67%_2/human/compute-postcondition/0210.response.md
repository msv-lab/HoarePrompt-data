Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` now contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged, `extra` includes `a[1]` if it was not in `todo`, or excludes `a[1]` if it was in `todo`, and `j` is set to 2 if `a[1]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `j` remains 1.
