Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, the number of iterations left to execute is one less than the previous iteration, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty set named `done`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `m`, `k`, `todo`, or the number of iterations left to execute. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `done` is updated to be an empty set.
