Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is a set containing either `a[0]` (if `a[j]` is in `todo`) or no elements (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`), `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` (since `extra.add(a[j])` adds `a[j]` to `extra`), `j` is incremented by 1 if it was 0, or reset to 0 if it was 1.**

This means that the set `extra` now includes the element `a[j]`. The values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, `todo`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged except for `j`, which is incremented by 1 if it was 0, or reset to 0 if it was 1.
