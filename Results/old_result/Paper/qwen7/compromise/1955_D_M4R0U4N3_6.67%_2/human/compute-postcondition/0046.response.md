Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, and either `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo` or no changes occur to `done` and `todo`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. Since `a[r]` was previously in `todo`, it is now removed. The other variables (`r`, `m`, `n`, `old`) retain their previous values. Additionally, if `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) was in `extra` and not in `done`, it would be moved from `done` to `todo`. However, since the problem statement mentions that if `old` is no longer in `extra`, then either `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, or no changes occur to `done` and `todo`, we include both possibilities in the output state.
