Postcondition: `r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is now in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `old` is in `done` or not (since the else part is none), `r` remains either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is moved to `todo`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and the updates to `extra` and `todo` are performed based on the original states of these variables as per the conditions provided.
