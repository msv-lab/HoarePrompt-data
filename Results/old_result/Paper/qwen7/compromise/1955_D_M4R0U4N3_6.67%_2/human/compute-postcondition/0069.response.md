Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1, if `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`; otherwise, `old` is added to `todo`.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The conditions regarding `done`, `todo`, `ans`, and `old` remain unchanged.
