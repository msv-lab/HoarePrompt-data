Postcondition: `r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is now in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.

This postcondition indicates that after executing the if-else block, `r` remains either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`. Regardless of whether `old` was initially in `extra` or `todo`, it is now moved to `todo`. The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. Additionally, the contents of `extra` and `todo` are updated based on their original states according to the specified conditions.
