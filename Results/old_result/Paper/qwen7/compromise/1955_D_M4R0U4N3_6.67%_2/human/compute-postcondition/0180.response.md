Output State: **`ans` is either 3 or 4; `r` is `m + 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was initially either 2 or 3, after incrementing it becomes either 3 or 4. The values of `r` and `m` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet. All other conditions and their impacts on `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain the same as the initial postconditions specified.
