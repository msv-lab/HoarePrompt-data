Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `extra` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `done`. Given that `j` is initially 0, `a[0]` is added to `done`. The other variables remain unchanged.
