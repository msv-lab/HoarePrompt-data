Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers, `done` is an empty set, and either `extra` is an empty set with `a[j]` removed from `todo` and added to `done`, or `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` with `a[j]` added to `extra`.**
