Output State: **`r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, `done` includes `old` if `old` was in `todo` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`, `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.**

Explanation: The code removes `old` from the `extra` set. This affects the `extra` set by removing `old` if it was present. The other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged, except for the removal of `old` from `extra`. The value of `ans` is increased by 1, and the updates to `todo` and `done` based on the condition `len(done) >= k` are maintained as per their original logic.
