Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `j` is equal to `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set that may contain some integers, `done` is a set that contains integers that were found in `todo` and removed from it, and `extra` is a set that contains integers that were not found in `todo` but were present in `a`.**

In this final state, the loop has iterated through each index `j` from `0` to `m-1` in the list `a`. For each index `j`:
- If `a[j]` was in the `todo` set, it has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
- If `a[j]` was not in `todo`, it has been added to `extra`.

The values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` reflect the operations performed during the loop's execution.
