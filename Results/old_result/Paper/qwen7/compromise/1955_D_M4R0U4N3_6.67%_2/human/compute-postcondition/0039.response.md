Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `old` is not in `extra`, `old` is no longer in `done`, `todo` contains `old`**.

The code adds `old` to the set `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
