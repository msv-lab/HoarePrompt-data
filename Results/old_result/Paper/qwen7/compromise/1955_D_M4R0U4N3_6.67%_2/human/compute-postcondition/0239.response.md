Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, if `old` is found in `extra`, then `old` is no longer in `extra`, if `old` is found in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo`, if `old` is not in `done`, then `old` remains unchanged in `todo`, additionally, if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`, if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `a[r]` is not in `todo` and may or may not be in `extra` or `done` depending on the conditions mentioned, the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The values of `old`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`, `a`, `r`, `m`, and `k` remain as per their initial conditions except for the changes described above.
