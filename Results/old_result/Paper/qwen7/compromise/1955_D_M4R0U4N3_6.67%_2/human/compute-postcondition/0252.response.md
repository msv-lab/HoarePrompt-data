Output State: **`r` is `r_end + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m - 1]`, `extra` now includes `a[r]`, `done` does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`, `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done`, `extra` does not include `old` if `old` was in `extra`, `done` does not include `old`, and `todo` adds `old` if `old` was in `done`.**

Explanation:
- `r` is incremented by 1 because `extra.add(a[r])` adds `a[r]` to `extra`, and `r` was initially `r_end + 1`.
- `old` is updated to `a[r - m - 1]` which is `a[r_end + 1 - m - 1]` or `a[r_end - m]`.
- `extra` now includes `a[r]` because `extra.add(a[r])` was executed.
- The conditions for `done`, `todo`, `extra`, and `old` are updated according to the rules provided in the initial state.
