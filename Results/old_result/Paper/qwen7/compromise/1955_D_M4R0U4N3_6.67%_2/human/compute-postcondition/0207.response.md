Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers excluding `a[1]`, `done` now contains either `a[1]` or remains unchanged, `extra` is updated to exclude `a[1]` if it was in `todo` or contains `a[1]` if it was not in `todo`.**

This means that the element `a[1]` has been removed from the set `todo`. If `a[1]` was originally in `todo`, `todo` now excludes `a[1]`, and `extra` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` was not in `todo`, `extra` now includes `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
