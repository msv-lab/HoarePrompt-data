Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; if `old` is found in `extra`, then `old` is no longer in `extra`; if `old` is found in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo`; if `old` is not in `done`, then `old` remains unchanged in `todo`; `a[r]` is now in `todo`; `todo` has removed `a[r]` from it.**

This means that after executing the line `todo.remove(a[r])`, the element `a[r]` has been removed from the list `todo`. All other conditions related to `old`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remain as described in the initial postconditions.
