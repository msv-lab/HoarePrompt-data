Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; if `old` is found in `extra`, then `old` is no longer in `extra`; if `old` is found in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo`; if `old` is not in `done`, then `old` remains unchanged in `todo`; `a[r]` is now in `todo`; `todo` has removed `a[r]` from it; `done` now contains `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `done`. This means that if `old` was already in `done`, it would remain there, and if `old` was not in `done`, it would remain unchanged in `todo`. Additionally, `a[r]` is added to `todo` and removed from `todo`, which effectively does nothing to `todo`. The other conditions about `extra` and `old` remain as stated in the initial state.
