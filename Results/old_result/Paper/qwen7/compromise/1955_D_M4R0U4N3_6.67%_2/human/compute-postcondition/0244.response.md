Output State: **`r` is `r_end + 1`, `old` is `a[r_end + 1 - m]`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `done` includes `a[r_end + 1]` if it was in `todo`, `todo` does not include `a[r_end + 1]` if it was in `todo` and includes `old` if `old` was in `done`, `old` is now `a[r - m]`**.

Explanation:
- The code removes `old` from the set `extra`. Since `old` was previously in `extra`, it is no longer present in `extra`.
- The value of `r`, `r_end`, `m`, `a[r_end + 1 - m]`, `a[r - m]`, and the relationships between `done` and `todo` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
