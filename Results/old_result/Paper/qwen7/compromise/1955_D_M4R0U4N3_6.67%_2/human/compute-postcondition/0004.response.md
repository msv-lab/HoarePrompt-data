Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers obtained from the input split, `done` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `done`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `todo`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `done` being an empty set.
