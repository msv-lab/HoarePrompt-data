Output State: **`r` is `r_end + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `done` includes `old`, `todo` does not include `old`, `extra` is `extra - {old}`, `done` is `done + {old}`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. Initially, `done` does not include `old`, but since `old` was in `todo` and now has been added to `done`, `todo` no longer includes `old`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
