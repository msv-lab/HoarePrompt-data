Output State: **`r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is now in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` includes `a[r]`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This operation does not affect the values of `r`, `old`, `ans`, `extra`, or `todo` directly, but it updates `extra` to include `a[r]`. The values of `r`, `old`, `ans`, `extra`, and `todo` remain as per the postconditions given, with `old` being added to `todo` and `ans` incremented by 1.
