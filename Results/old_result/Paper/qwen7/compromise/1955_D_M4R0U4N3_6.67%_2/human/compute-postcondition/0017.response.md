Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `todo` list has the element at index `j` removed, `done` set has the element `a[j]` added.**

Explanation: The code adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `done`. Since `j` is 1, the element `a[1]` is added to the set `done`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `j` remains 1, `m` remains at least 1, the `todo` list has the element at index `j` (which is `a[1]`) removed, and the `done` set now contains the element `a[1]`.
