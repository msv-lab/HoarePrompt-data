Postcondition: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is either added to `done` or `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; if `old` is in `extra`, `extra.remove(old)` is executed and `old` is no longer assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; if `old` is in `done`, `ans` is increased by 1 and `todo` now contains `old`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `len(done) >= k` is true, `ans` is increased by 1, and the other conditions remain as specified in the if part. If the condition is false, no additional changes occur beyond what is already described in the if part.
