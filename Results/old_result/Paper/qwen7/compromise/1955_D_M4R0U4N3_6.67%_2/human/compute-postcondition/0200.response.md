Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values.
   - `ans` retains its original value.
   - `r` is equal to `n - 2`.
   - `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `done` is a set containing either `a[0]` (if `a[j]` is in `todo`) or no elements (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`).
   - `extra` is a set containing either `a[j]` (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`) or no elements (if `a[j]` is in `todo`).
   - `j` is 1 (if `a[j]` is in `todo`) or 0 (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`).
   - `m` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it iterates, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is either 0 or 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is an external variable and does not change within the loop.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - `todo` remains unchanged.
   - `done` remains unchanged.
   - `extra` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1.
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.

Given these considerations, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is a set containing either `a[0]` (if `a[j]` is in `todo`) or no elements (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`), `extra` is a set containing either `a[j]` (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`) or no elements (if `a[j]` is in `todo`), `j` is 1 (if `a[j]` is in `todo`) or 2 (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`), `m` must be greater than 0.**
