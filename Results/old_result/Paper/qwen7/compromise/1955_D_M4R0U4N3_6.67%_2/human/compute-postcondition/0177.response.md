Output State: **`ans` is either 2 or 3; `r` is `m + 2`; `extra` includes `a[r]`; `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Since `r` is defined as `m + 2`, `r` remains `m + 2`. The values of `ans`, `done`, and `todo` do not change because the code does not modify them. Therefore, `ans` is still either 2 or 3, and `r` is still `m + 2`. The set `extra` now includes the element `a[r]`.
