Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers with `a[j]` removed, `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is an empty set.**

The code removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. Since `a[j]` was originally in `todo`, after the removal, `todo` no longer contains `a[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
