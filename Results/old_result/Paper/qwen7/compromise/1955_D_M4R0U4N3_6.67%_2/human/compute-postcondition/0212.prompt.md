Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is a set containing either `a[0]` (if `a[j]` is in `todo`) or no elements (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`), `extra` is a set containing either `a[j]` (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`) or no elements (if `a[j]` is in `todo`), `j` is 1 (if `a[j]` is in `todo`) or 0 (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`), `m` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` now contains either `a[j]` or remains unchanged, `extra` is updated to exclude `a[j]` if it was in `todo` or contains `a[j]` if it was not in `todo`, `j` is incremented by 1 if it was 0, or reset to 0 if it was 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` now contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged, `extra` includes `a[1]` if it was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` excludes `a[1]`, and `j` is set to 2 if `a[1]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `j` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
