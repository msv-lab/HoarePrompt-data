Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[j]`, `j` is 1, `todo` does not contain `a[j]`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` (where `j` is 1) from the set `todo`. Since `j` is 1, the code removes `a[1]` from `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged.
