Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` now contains either `a[j]` or remains unchanged, `extra` is updated to exclude `a[j]` if it was in `todo` or contains `a[j]` if it was not in `todo`, `j` is incremented by 1 if it was 0, or reset to 0 if it was 1.**
