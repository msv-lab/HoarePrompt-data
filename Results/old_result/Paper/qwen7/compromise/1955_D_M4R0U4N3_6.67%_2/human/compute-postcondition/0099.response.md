Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, the number of iterations left to execute is one less than the previous iteration, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `extra`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `extra` being an empty set, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
