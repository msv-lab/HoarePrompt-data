Output State: **`r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `done` includes `old` if `old` was in `todo` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`, `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.**

Explanation: The variable `old` is now assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. The other conditions related to `extra`, `done`, `todo`, and `ans` remain unchanged based on their previous states. The value of `ans` is increased by 1, and `extra` and `todo` are updated according to their previous states relative to `old`.
