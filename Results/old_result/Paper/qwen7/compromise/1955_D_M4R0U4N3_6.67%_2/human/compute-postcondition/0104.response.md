Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers excluding the current value of `a[j]`, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `done.add(a[j])` adds the value of `a[j]` (which is `a[0]` since `j` is 0) to the set `done`. After this operation, `done` contains `a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
