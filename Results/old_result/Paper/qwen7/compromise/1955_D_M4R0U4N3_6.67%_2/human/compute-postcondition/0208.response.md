Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers excluding `a[1]`, `done` now contains `a[1]`, `extra` is updated to exclude `a[1]` if it was in `todo` or contains `a[1]` if it was not in `todo`.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Since `j` is not defined in the given context, we assume `j` refers to the index `1` (as `a[1]` is mentioned in the initial state). Therefore, `a[1]` is added to the set `done`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state description.
