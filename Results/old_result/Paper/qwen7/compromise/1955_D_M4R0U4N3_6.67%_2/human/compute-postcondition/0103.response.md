Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers excluding the current value of `a[j]`, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code removes the current value of `a[j]` from the set `todo`. Since `a[j]` was in `todo` before the operation, it is no longer present in `todo` after the removal. All other variables remain unchanged.
