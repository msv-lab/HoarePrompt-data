Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `len(done)` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo`. Otherwise, if `a[r]` is in `extra` and `old` is no longer in `extra`, then either `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, or no changes occur to `done` and `todo`.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. The conditions and relationships between the variables `r`, `m`, `n`, `old`, `done`, and `todo` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
