Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers obtained from the input split, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The line `extra = set()` creates an empty set named `extra`. The values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `todo`, and `done` remain unchanged from their initial states.
