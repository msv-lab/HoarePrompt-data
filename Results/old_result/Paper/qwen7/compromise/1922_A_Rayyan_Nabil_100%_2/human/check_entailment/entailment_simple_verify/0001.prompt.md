You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

If such an index exists, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it continues all iterations without finding any such index and implicitly returns 'NO'.

    #State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is printed on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match `t`, but string `c` does not match `t`.

2. **Template Matching Conditions**:
   - If the `i-th` character of the template is lowercase, the corresponding characters in `a`, `b`, and `c` must match.
   - If the `i-th` character of the template is uppercase, the corresponding characters in `a`, `b`, and `c` must be different.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It checks if the `i-th` characters of `a` and `b` do not match the `i-th` character of `c`.
   - If this condition holds for any position, it returns `'YES'`. Otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to the list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]` for any position `i`. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of a valid template.
   - The function `func_1` does not consider the uppercase condition, which is crucial for determining if a template can exist where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the first test case (`n=1`), `a='a'`, `b='b'`, `c='c'`. Both `a` and `b` do not match `c`, so the function correctly returns `'YES'`.
   - In the second test case (`n=2`), `a='aa'`, `b='bb'`, `c='aa'`. Both `a` and `b` match `c`, so the function incorrectly returns `'NO'`.
   - In the third test case (`n=10`), `a='mathforces'`, `b='luckforces'`, `c='adhoccoder'`. There is no single character position where `a` and `b` do not match `c`, so the function incorrectly returns `'NO'`.
   - In the fourth test case (`n=3`), `a='acc'`, `b='abd'`, `c='abc'`. There is no single character position where `a` and `b` do not match `c`, so the function incorrectly returns `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the existence of a valid template. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
