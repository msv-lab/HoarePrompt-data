You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: Output State: The value returned by the function is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether there exists at least one index `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is also not equal to `c[i]`. If such an index exists, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it continues all iterations without finding any such index and implicitly returns 'NO'.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and it is the number of iterations the loop executed; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the respective inputs `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is printed on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if for each position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. Instead, it should check if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  aa
  bb
  ab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

In this case, the function returns `NO` because it incorrectly assumes that since `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same positions, the strings do not match the template. However, a valid template could be "AA", where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, and the output is incorrect for this and potentially other cases.
