Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
- The `func_1` function checks if there is at least one index where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of such a template.
- However, `func_1` does not fully address the problem because it only checks if `a` and `b` can match a template and `c` cannot, without ensuring that `a` and `b` can indeed match any template and `c` cannot.
- The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each case and collecting the results.
- Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, `func_1` alone does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that `a` and `b` can match any template and `c` cannot. Instead, it only checks for one specific condition.

Therefore, the given program is not correct because `func_1` does not fully meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
