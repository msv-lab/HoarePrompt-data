Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts integers t and n such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and strings a, b, and c consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. It then performs some unspecified operations based on these inputs and returns an unspecified result for each test case.**

Note: The specific operations and return values are not detailed in the provided information, so the functionality description focuses on the input parameters and their constraints.
