Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n-1`, respectively.
   - Two variables `st` and `end` are initialized to 0. These are used to count the number of consecutive elements at the start and end of the array that are equal to their respective neighbors.

3. **Left Pointer Adjustment:**
   - The program checks if the elements from the start of the array are equal. If they are, it increments the left pointer `l` and increases `st` until it finds a different element.

4. **Right Pointer Adjustment:**
   - Similarly, the program checks if the elements from the end of the array are equal. If they are, it decrements the right pointer `r` and increases `end` until it finds a different element.

5. **Case Analysis:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the program calculates the length of the subarray from `l+1` to `r-1` as the answer.
   - If the array is already uniform (no need for any operation), the answer is 0.
   - If the array is not uniform but the start and end segments are uniform, the program calculates the length of the non-uniform part as the answer.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the length of the entire array minus 1 as the answer.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated answer.

### Correctness Check:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform (all elements are the same).
  - The program correctly handles the case where the array is not uniform but the start and end segments are uniform.
  - The program correctly handles the case where the array is not uniform and needs a single operation to make all elements equal.

- **General Case:**
  - The logic for adjusting the left and right pointers to find the non-uniform segments is correct.
  - The calculation of the answer based on these segments is also correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
