Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The code attempts to handle the operation where it tries to make all elements equal using a single operation but does not correctly calculate the cost or determine the optimal operation.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The logic for handling different edge cases (like when the first and last elements are different) is flawed. Specifically, the way `ans` is calculated does not reflect the actual cost of operations needed to make all elements equal.

3. **Operation Cost Calculation**: The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to make all elements equal, which involves finding the minimum length of subarray that needs to be changed to a common value. The current implementation does not correctly identify these subarrays and their costs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Identify segments of the array that have different values.
- Calculate the cost of changing each segment to the most frequent value within that segment.
- Sum up these costs to get the minimum total cost.

Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

```python
def min_cost_to_equalize(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    max_freq = 0
    freq = {}
    
    # Find the most frequent element
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        max_freq = max(max_freq, freq[num])
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost
    cost = 0
    start = 0
    for end in range(n):
        freq[arr[end]] -= 1
        while start <= end and freq[arr[start]] < max_freq:
            freq[arr[start]] += 1
            start += 1
        cost += end - start + 1
    
    return cost - n

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min_cost_to_equalize(arr))

func()
```

This approach correctly identifies the segments and calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
