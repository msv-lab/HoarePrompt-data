Output State: **`l` is equal to `r - k`, `r` is `n - k - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is `k`, and `ans` is `r - l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = r - l` updates the value of `ans` to be the difference between `r` and `l`. Given the initial conditions, `r` is `n - k - 1` and `l` is `r - k`. Therefore, `ans` is calculated as `(n - k - 1) - (n - k - 1 - k)`, which simplifies to `k`. However, since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we express `ans` as `r - l`. All other variables (`st`, `end`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
