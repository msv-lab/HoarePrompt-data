Output State: `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 3, `end` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `l` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Since `l` starts at `n - 1` and increases by 1 with each iteration, it will eventually equal `r` when `r` is also `n - 1`. The variable `r` decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop but stops when `l` equals `r`. The variable `st` remains 3 because it is incremented by 1 for each iteration, and the loop has executed 3 times. The variable `end` is also 3, as it is incremented by 1 for each iteration and the loop has completed 3 iterations.
