Output State: **`ans` is `len(a) - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is incremented by 0, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `len(a) - 1` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `st`, `end`, `l`, and `r`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
