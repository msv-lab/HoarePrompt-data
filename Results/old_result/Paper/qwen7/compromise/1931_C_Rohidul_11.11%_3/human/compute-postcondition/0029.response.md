Output State: **`st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is `r - l - 1`.**

The code `ans = r - l - 1` calculates the value of `ans` by subtracting `l` from `r` and then subtracting 1. However, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and no new information about `st` or `end` is provided. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
