Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `l` is `n - 1`
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `st` is 3

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

3. **Given Information:**
   - The loop has executed 3 times.
   - After the third iteration, `l` becomes 4 (since `l` starts at `n - 1` and increases by 1 each iteration).
   - `st` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `st` is 3.

4. **Determine the Final Values of `l` and `r`:**
   - Since the loop has executed 3 times, `l` is now 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than `l`, which means `r` must be greater than 4.
   - Given that `l` and `r` will eventually become equal and both will be `n - 1` at the end of the loop, `r` must be greater than 4 but will eventually become 4 when the loop terminates.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop condition `r > l` is satisfied initially.
   - Since `l` is 4, `r` must be greater than 4 to satisfy the condition `r > l`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `r` is greater than `l` (which is 4).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`l` is 4, `r` must be greater than 4, `st` is 3**
