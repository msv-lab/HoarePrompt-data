Output State: **`l` is equal to `r - 4`, `r` is `n - 5`, and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was equal to `n - 4`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 5`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` is now equal to `r - 4`, which is `(n - 5) - 3` or `n - 8`. The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must still hold true.
