Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Current States**: 
   - `st` is 1
   - `end` is 0
   - `a[0] == a[1]`

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `l`, `r`, and the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.
   - Since `a[0] == a[1]` is given, this part of the condition is already satisfied.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `l < r` is true.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `l` is less than `r` for the loop to continue. Given that `l` and `r` are not explicitly mentioned in the current states, we need to assume they are part of the loop head and adjust accordingly.
   - Since `l` and `r` are not provided in the current states, we can infer that `l` and `r` must be such that `l < r` holds true for the loop to execute one more time.

Given these considerations, we need to ensure that `l < r` is true. Since `l` and `r` are not explicitly stated, we can assume they are part of the loop head and need to be adjusted to satisfy the condition.

**Final State**:
State: **`st` is 1, `end` is 0, `l` must be less than `r`, and `a[0] == a[1]`**
