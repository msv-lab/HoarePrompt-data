Output State: **`st` is 2, `end` is 0, `l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 2, and `a[2] == a[3]`**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` is 2, so after executing the code, `l` becomes 3. The other variables (`st`, `end`, `r`, and the condition `a[2] == a[3]`) remain unchanged.
