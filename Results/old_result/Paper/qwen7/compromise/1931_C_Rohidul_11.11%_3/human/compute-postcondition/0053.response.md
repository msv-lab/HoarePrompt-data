Output State: `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive identical elements at the start of the list minus 1, `ans` is either `r - l - 1` if the first and last elements are identical and there are consecutive identical elements at the start, or `len(a) - 1` if the first and last elements are not identical, or `n - 1 - l` otherwise.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `l` as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Given that the loop has executed three times and `l` is now 4, it means there were at least 4 consecutive identical elements at the start of the list. The loop will continue until `l` is no longer less than `r` or the elements are no longer identical. Since `r` remains `n - 1` throughout, the loop will stop when `l` equals `r`, meaning all consecutive identical elements at the start have been processed. At this point, `st` will be the count of these consecutive elements minus 1. The value of `ans` will depend on the comparison between the first and last elements of the list, as described in the problem statement.
