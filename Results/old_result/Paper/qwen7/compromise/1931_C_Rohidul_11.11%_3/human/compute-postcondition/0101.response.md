Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `l` is equal to `r - 3`.
   - `r` is `n - 4`.
   - `end` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head involves two variables: `r` and `l`.

4. **Check the Current Values:**
   - `l = r - 3`
   - `r = n - 4`

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   For the loop to execute again, both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `l = r - 3`, the condition `r > l` is already satisfied.
   - We need to ensure `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true for the next iteration.

Given the current states:
- `l` is `r - 3`.
- `r` is `n - 4`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `r` must still satisfy `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must hold true. Since `l` is fixed as `r - 3`, the only variable that can change is `r` (and consequently `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`).

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `r` such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true for the next iteration. However, since no specific value for `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` is given, we cannot adjust these values directly. Instead, we need to ensure that the loop condition remains valid.

Since `l` is fixed as `r - 3`, and `r` is `n - 4`, the only way to ensure the loop can execute again is to keep `r` such that `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true.

Therefore, the state adjustment required is to ensure `r` remains such that `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` is equal to `r - 3`, `r` is `n - 4`, and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must hold true.**
