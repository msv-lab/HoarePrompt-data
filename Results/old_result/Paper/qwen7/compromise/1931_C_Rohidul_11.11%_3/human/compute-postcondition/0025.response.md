Output State: **`end` is increased by 1, `r` is one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration and must be greater than `l`, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. The other variables (`r`, `l`, and `a[r]`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes `end` being increased by 1 while keeping the conditions and values of `r`, `l`, and `a[r]` as they were before the increment.
