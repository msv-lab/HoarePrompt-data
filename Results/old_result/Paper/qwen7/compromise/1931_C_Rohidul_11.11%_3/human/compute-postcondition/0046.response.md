Output State: **`l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. However, since `l` and `r` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` is still 1, but since the problem specifies the initial state as `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, after executing `st += 1`, `l` becomes 2 while `r` remains `n - 1`.
