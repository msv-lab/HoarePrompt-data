Output State: **`r` is one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.**

This means that the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, while the conditions on `l` and the relationship between `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` remain unchanged.
