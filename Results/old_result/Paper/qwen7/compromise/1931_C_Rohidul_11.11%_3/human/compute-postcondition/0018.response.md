Output State: **`r` is decreased by 1, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is 0, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[n - 2]` must be equal to `a[n - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, while the other variables retain their initial conditions. The value of `st` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the operation. The conditions on `end`, `l`, and the relationship between `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 1]` remain valid.
