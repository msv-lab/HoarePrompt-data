Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 0, 0
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = r - l - 1
    elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        ans = len(a) - 1
    else:
        ans = r - l
    print(max(0, ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is either `r - l - 1` if the first and last elements are identical and there are consecutive identical elements at the start, or `len(a) - 1` if the first and last elements are not identical, or `n - 1 - l` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is either 0 or `n - 1`, `r` is either 0 or `n - 1`, `st` is either 4 or 0, `end` is either 4 or 0, `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `l` is equal to `r - k`, `r` is `n - k - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is `k`, and `ans` is `r - l - 1` if `a[0] == a[-1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0`, `end == 0`, and `a[0] != a[-1]` hold true, or `r - l` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
