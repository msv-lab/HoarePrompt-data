Output State: `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 3.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, we know that `l` has increased by 3 (from 0 to 3, then to 4, and so on). After the third iteration, `l` becomes 4. For the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than `l`, which means `r` must be greater than 3. However, since the loop condition is `l < r`, and `l` eventually equals `r`, the final values of `l` and `r` will be the same, which is `n - 1`. The variable `st` increments by 1 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `st` is 3.
