Output State: **`i` remains 1, `j` becomes 3, `sm` remains unchanged, `over_sum` remains unchanged, `r` is 1, `l` is 3**.

The code `r, l = [i, j]` unpacks the list `[i, j]` into the variables `r` and `l`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, `r` will be assigned the value of `i` (which is 1), and `l` will be assigned the value of `j` (which is 3). The values of `sm`, `over_sum`, and `r` and `l` from before the code execution are preserved.
