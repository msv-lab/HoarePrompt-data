Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(lst)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
        sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
        if sm > over_sum:
            r, l = [i, j]
            over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, j is len(lst) - 1, r is 0, l is len(lst) - 1, over_sum is the maximum value of sm calculated during the loop executions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, j is len(lst), r is 1, l is 3, over_sum is lst[0] + lst[2] + 9.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, `r` is 2, `l` is 5, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 2 because the loop increments `j` but does not change `i`. The value of `j` becomes greater than or equal to the length of `lst` since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `lst`. The value of `r` remains 2 because it was only updated to 4 once, and subsequent updates did not make `sm` greater than `over_sum`. The value of `l` is updated to 5 because `j` reaches a point where further iterations do not find a larger `sm`. The value of `over_sum` remains `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9` because no new sum `sm` was found that exceeded this value during the loop iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
