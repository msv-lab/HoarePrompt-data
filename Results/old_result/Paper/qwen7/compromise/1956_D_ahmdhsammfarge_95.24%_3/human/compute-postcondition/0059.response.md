Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 5, `r` is 2, `l` is 5, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` unpacks the list `[i, j]` into the variables `r` and `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than 5. Thus, `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2, and `l` is assigned the value of `j`. The values of `over_sum` and `sm` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.
