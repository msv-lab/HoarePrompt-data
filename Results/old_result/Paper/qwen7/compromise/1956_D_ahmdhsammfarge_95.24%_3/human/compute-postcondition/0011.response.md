Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst). `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The function replaces the sublist in `lst` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) with a list of `r - l + 1` elements, each element being equal to `r - l + 1`. The function returns the modified list `lst`.**
