Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 4, `r` is 4, `l` is 2, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1), `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` simply assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is defined as `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` also takes the same value. The values of `i`, `j`, `r`, and `l` are updated according to the given conditions, with `r` being swapped to 2 and `l` to 4. The conditions for `j` and the expressions for `over_sum` and `sm` remain unchanged.
