Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(len(lst)):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is `len(lst)`
   - `r` is 1
   - `l` is 3
   - `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(lst)`. 

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `j` remains unchanged because it is defined as `len(lst)` and does not change within the loop.
   - The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - The value of `over_sum` remains unchanged because it is not recalculated within the loop.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2
   - `j` is still `len(lst)`
   - `r` is still 1
   - `l` is still 3
   - `over_sum` is still `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `len(lst)`, `r` is 1, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`**.
