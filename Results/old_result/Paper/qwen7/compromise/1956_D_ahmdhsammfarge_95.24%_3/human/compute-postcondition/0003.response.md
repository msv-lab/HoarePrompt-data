Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `ops` is a list containing `[[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the function does not change the list `lst` or the list `ops`. Since there is no else part, the list `lst` and `ops` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is met or not.
