Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` is `r + 1`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `n` is `l - r + 1`; the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is now replaced by a list of `n` elements, each element being equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The original list `lst` is of length `n`.
- The slice assignment `lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]` replaces the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a new list containing `n` elements, each equal to `n`.
- The values of `r`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged in terms of their expressions (`r + 1`, `l + 1`, and `l - r + 1` respectively), but the content of `lst` changes as described.
