Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `ops` is a list containing `[[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. Since `ops` already contained `[r + 1, l + 1]`, appending it again results in `ops` having two identical elements. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
