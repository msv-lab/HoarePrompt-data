#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers with length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18), where n is the length of the input array a.
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 6, `r` is 2, `l` is 5, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 2 because the loop increments `j` but does not change `i`. The value of `j` becomes 6 (or greater) since the loop continues until `j` is no longer less than the length of `lst`. The value of `r` remains 2 because it was only updated to 4 once, and subsequent updates did not make `sm` greater than `over_sum`. The value of `l` is updated to 5 because `j` reaches a point where further iterations do not find a larger `sm`. The value of `over_sum` remains `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9` because no new sum `sm` was found that exceeded this value during the loop iterations.
    return r, l
    #The program returns r which is 2 and l which is 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns two integers `r` and `l`, both fixed at 2 and 5 respectively. It calculates the sum of elements excluding pairs of indices `(i, j)` and finds the pair that maximizes the sum of the excluded elements plus a quadratic term based on the distance between indices. However, the returned values `r` and `l` are hardcoded to 2 and 5 regardless of the input list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 0 <= r < n, l is an integer such that 0 <= l < n, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.
def func_2(r, l, ops):
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.
    #State: `r` is an integer such that 0 <= r < n, `l` is an integer such that 0 <= l < n, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The values of `r` and `l` are not equal.
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `r` and `l`, which are integers within specified ranges, and `ops`, a list for storing operations. If `r` equals `l`, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list and terminates. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice with `l` decremented by 1 each time, and appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list after the recursive calls. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers of length n, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `ops` is a list containing `[[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the function does not change the list `lst` or the list `ops`. Since there is no else part, the list `lst` and `ops` remain unchanged regardless of the condition.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list `lst` where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced by a list of `n` elements, each element being equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It replaces the sublist in `lst` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) with a list of `r - l + 1` elements, each element being equal to `r - l + 1`. The function appends certain operations to the `ops` list and calls another function `func_2(r, l, ops)`. After performing these operations, the function returns the modified list `lst`.
