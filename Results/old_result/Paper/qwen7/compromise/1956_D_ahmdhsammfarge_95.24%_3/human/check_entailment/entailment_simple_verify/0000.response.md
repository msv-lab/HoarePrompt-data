### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function aims to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the array plus the square of the subarray length.
- The logic inside the function is flawed. It calculates the sum of elements before and after a subarray, plus the square of the subarray length, but it does not actually find the MEX of the subarray and update the array accordingly.
- The function returns `r` and `l`, but these values do not represent the optimal subarray for MEX maximization.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function recursively appends operations to the list `ops`.
- It does not perform any meaningful operations on the array or calculate MEX values.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function also attempts to append operations to the list `ops`.
- It does not update the array based on the MEX value of the subarray.
- The function sets the subarray from `r` to `l` to a constant value `n`, which is the length of the subarray. However, it does not ensure that the MEX value is used.

#### Main Program Logic:
- The main program reads the input array and initializes the operations list.
- It calls `func_1` to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum.
- It then enters a loop where it repeatedly calls `func_3` with the indices `r` and `l` to update the array.
- Finally, it tries to set all zeros to 1 to ensure the array is fully updated.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic. Specifically, it does not find the MEX value for each subarray and update the array accordingly. Instead, it attempts to maximize a different metric (sum + subarray length squared), which is irrelevant to the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**False**
