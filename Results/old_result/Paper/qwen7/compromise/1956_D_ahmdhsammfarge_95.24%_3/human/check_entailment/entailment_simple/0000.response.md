### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations.

2. **Finding Initial Operation Range (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find a range `[i, j]` that maximizes the sum of the array by considering subarrays.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` seems flawed. Specifically, the inner loop iterates over `j` without updating `i`, leading to incorrect results. This function should ideally find the optimal range to apply the operation to maximize the sum, but it currently does not.

3. **Applying Operations (`func_3`):**
   - The function `func_3` applies the operation to the identified range `[r, l]` by setting all elements in this range to the length of the range.
   - This function correctly sets the range to the same value, but it has some redundant operations and does not handle the case when the minimum value in the range is 0.

4. **Handling Zeros (`try-except` block):**
   - The program tries to replace zeros with 1s and records these operations.
   - This part of the code is logically correct and ensures that all zeros are handled.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final sum of the array and the number of operations performed.
   - It also prints the operations themselves.

### Analysis of the Provided Functions:

- **`func_1`:** The logic for finding the optimal range is incorrect. The inner loop should update both `i` and `j` to explore different ranges, but it only updates `j` and does not reset `i` properly.
- **`func_3`:** While the logic to set the range to the length of the range is correct, the redundant operations and handling of zeros could be optimized.
- **`func_2`:** This function is recursive and seems to be used to generate operations, but its purpose is unclear from the provided context.

### Conclusion:

Given the flawed logic in `func_1` and the redundancy in `func_3`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The provided solution does not ensure that the maximum possible sum is achieved and may not produce the correct sequence of operations.

### Final Answer:

**Correctness: False**
