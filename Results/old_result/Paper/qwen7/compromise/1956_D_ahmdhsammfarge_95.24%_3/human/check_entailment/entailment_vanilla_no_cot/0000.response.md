Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Approach in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum by considering all possible subarrays and their contributions to the overall sum. However, the logic used to calculate `sm` (sum of elements before and after the subarray plus the square of the subarray length) is flawed. This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to use the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value to fill the subarray.
   
2. **Incorrect Use of MEX in `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` attempts to update the subarray using the MEX value but does not correctly implement the MEX calculation. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The current implementation does not properly handle this.
   - Additionally, the function `func_3` does not ensure that the MEX value is correctly applied to the entire subarray.

3. **Lack of Proper MEX Calculation:**
   - The problem requires finding the MEX of a subarray and setting all elements in that subarray to this MEX value. The provided functions do not correctly implement this step.

4. **Incorrect Output Format:**
   - The program does not output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations as required. The output format is not correctly implemented.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one would need to:
- Identify the MEX of each subarray.
- Update the subarray with the MEX value.
- Ensure the operations are recorded and the final sum is maximized.

Given the complexity and the specific requirements of the problem, a more appropriate solution would involve dynamic programming or greedy algorithms to efficiently find the MEX and update the array accordingly.
