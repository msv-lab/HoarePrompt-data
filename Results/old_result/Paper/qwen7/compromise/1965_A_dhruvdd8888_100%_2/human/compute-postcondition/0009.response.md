Output State: **`cw` is True, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element is initially from the original list minus `ls`, and `nw` is set to True.**

The code `cw = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `cw`. This does not affect the values of `ls`, `t`, `N`, `nums`, or `nw`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
