Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The variable `N` is now an integer input by the user, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 2⋅10^5 (inclusive).
