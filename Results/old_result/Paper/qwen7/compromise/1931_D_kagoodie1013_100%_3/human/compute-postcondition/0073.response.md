Output State: `results` is a list containing the sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in all arrays within `test_cases`. After all iterations, `residue_map` contains the count of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays in `test_cases`. For each `num` in `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y`. The `current_key` is updated to `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr` during the last iteration of the loop. The `count` variable accumulates the sum of occurrences of each `(r_x, r_y)` pair found in all arrays, and this final value is appended to `results`.
