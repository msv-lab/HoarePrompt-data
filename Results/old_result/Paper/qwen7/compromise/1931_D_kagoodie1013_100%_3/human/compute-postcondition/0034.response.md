Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num`, `arr`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is `0 + residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`
   - `residue_map` is `{(current_key, 1)}`
   - `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`
   - `num` must be defined
   - `arr` must be a non-empty list
   - `r_y` is `num % y`
   - `r_x` is `-num % x`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `arr`, the variable `num` will change to the next element in `arr`.
   - The variable `arr` itself does not change; it remains the same list but with one less element since the current `num` has been processed.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `count` will be updated based on the new `num` according to the formula `count = count + residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`.
   - `residue_map` will remain the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `current_key` will change to `(num % x, num % y)` for the new `num`.
   - `num` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `arr` will have one less element, but it still must be a non-empty list.
   - `r_y` and `r_x` will be recalculated based on the new `num`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `count` will be updated based on the new `num`.
- `residue_map` remains the same.
- `current_key` changes to `(num % x, num % y)` for the new `num`.
- `num` changes to the next element in `arr`.
- `arr` has one less element but remains a non-empty list.
- `r_y` and `r_x` will be recalculated based on the new `num`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`count` is `count + residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, `residue_map` is `{(current_key, 1)}`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `arr` must be a non-empty list, `r_y` is `num % y`, `r_x` is `-num % x`**
