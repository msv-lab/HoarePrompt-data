Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `num` from the array `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `count` is initialized to `0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0)`.
   - `residue_map` is a dictionary where the key is `(-num % x, num % y)` and the value is `1`.
   - `current_key` is `(-num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the array `arr`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `count` is updated based on the current `num`.
   - `residue_map` and `current_key` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop body (assuming no modifications are made to them inside the loop).

5. **Update the State**:
   - For the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the array `arr`.
   - Since `count` is updated based on the current `num`, it will change in the next iteration.
   - `residue_map` and `current_key` will remain the same unless explicitly modified inside the loop, but since the problem does not indicate any such modification, they stay the same.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `count` will be updated based on the new `num`.
- `residue_map` and `current_key` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**`count` is updated based on the new `num`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(-num % x, num % y)` mapped to `1`, `current_key` is `(-num % x, num % y)`**.

Since `count` is the only variable that changes, we can express the state as:

State: **`count` is updated based on the new `num`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(-num % x, num % y)` mapped to `1`, `current_key` is `(-num % x, num % y)`**.
