Output State: **`count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `residue_map`. The variable `count` remains unchanged and is still 0. Therefore, the output state includes both the unchanged variable `count` and the newly created dictionary `residue_map`.
