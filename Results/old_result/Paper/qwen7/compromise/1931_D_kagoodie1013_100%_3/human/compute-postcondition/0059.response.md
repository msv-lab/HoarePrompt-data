Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, and `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r_x` to `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
