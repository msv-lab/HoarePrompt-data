Output State: **`current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `current_key` to `num % x, num % y`. The other variables (`count`, `residue_map`, `arr`, `r_x`, `r_y`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
