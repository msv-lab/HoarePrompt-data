Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `residue_map`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
