Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing the final value of `count` after processing all arrays in `test_cases`.**

This means that the program will return the list `results`, which contains the final count value calculated for each array in `test_cases` after performing the operations described in the given initial state. However, since no specific operations or values are provided within the code snippet to modify `results`, the exact content of `results` cannot be determined without additional context. The `results` list will contain the final `count` value for each array processed, but the actual values inside `results` depend on the processing logic applied to `test_cases`, `residue_map`, and other variables during the loop iterations.
