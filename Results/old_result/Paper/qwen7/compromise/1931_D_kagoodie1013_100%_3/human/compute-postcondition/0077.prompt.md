You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. The length of each tuple is n + 3, and it is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = num % x, num % y
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after processing all arrays in `test_cases`. `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays. `count` is the sum of all values obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in all arrays. `current_key` is the last computed key `num % x, num % y` from the final iteration of the loop over all arrays. `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in all arrays.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the final value of `count` after processing all arrays in `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. After processing all arrays in `test_cases`, the function returns a list `results` containing the final value of `count` for each array.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing the final value of `count` after processing all arrays in `test_cases`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
