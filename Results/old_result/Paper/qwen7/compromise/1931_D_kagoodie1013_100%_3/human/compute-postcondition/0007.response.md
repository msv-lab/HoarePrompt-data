Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0), `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` must be initialized, `arr` must contain at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The line `count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` increments `count` by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the dictionary `residue_map`. Since `residue_map` is initially an empty dictionary, `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` returns 0. Therefore, `count` remains unchanged at 0. All other variables and their conditions remain the same.
