Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is the sum of all values obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`.
   - `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key `(-num % x, num % y)` is mapped to its frequency.
   - `current_key` is the last computed key `num % x, num % y` from the final iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `test_cases`, which means the loop will continue as long as there are more test cases to process.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will change to the next set of values in `test_cases`.
   - The `results` list, `residue_map`, and `current_key` will be reset or updated based on the new values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` from the next test case in `test_cases`.

**State:**
- `results` is an empty list (or reset to an initial state).
- `residue_map` is an empty dictionary (or reset to an initial state).
- `current_key` is undefined (or reset to an initial state).

However, since we are focusing on the loop head variables, the states to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` is the next value of `n` in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of `x` in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of `y` in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of `arr` in `test_cases`**
