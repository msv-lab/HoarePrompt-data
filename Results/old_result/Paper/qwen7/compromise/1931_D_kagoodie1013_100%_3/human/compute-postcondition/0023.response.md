Output State: `count` is the sum of all values obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key `(-num % x, num % y)` is mapped to its frequency (i.e., how many times it appears as a result of processing elements in `arr` through the loop); `current_key` is the last computed key `num % x, num % y` from the final iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, `count` will be the total occurrences of pairs `(-num % x, num % y)` found in `residue_map` across all elements in `arr`. The `residue_map` will contain every unique pair `(-num % x, num % y)` encountered during the loop's execution, with each pair's value indicating how many times it appeared.
