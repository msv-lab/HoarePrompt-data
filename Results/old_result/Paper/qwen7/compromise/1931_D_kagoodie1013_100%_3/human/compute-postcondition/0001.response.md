Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `(n, x, y, arr)` and the object `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (arr).
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty.
   - The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` within the first tuple of `test_cases` will be used in the loop, but we don't need to specify their exact values because they are part of the loop body and can vary.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`test_cases` must contain at least one tuple**
