Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1, `residue_map` is {(current_key, 1)}, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y), `num` must be defined, `arr` must be a non-empty list, `r_y` is `num % y`, `r_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the current key in the `residue_map` dictionary. Initially, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, and `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`. The line `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` checks the current value of `current_key` in the dictionary. Since it was initially not present, `get` returns 0, and then 1 is added to it, making the value 1. Thus, the dictionary now contains `{(current_key, 1)}`. The other variables remain unchanged.
