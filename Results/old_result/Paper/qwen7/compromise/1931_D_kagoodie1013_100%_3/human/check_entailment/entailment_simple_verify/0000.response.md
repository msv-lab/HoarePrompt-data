### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It splits the input into tokens and parses the necessary data structures.
   - This part is correct and efficient for handling large inputs.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` and a dictionary `residue_map`.
   - It then iterates over each element in the array, calculating the residues `r_x` and `r_y` as follows:
     - `r_x = -num % x`
     - `r_y = num % y`
   - It uses these residues to update the `count` by checking the `residue_map`.
   - The `current_key` is calculated as `num % x, num % y` and used to update the `residue_map`.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The expression `r_x = -num % x` is used to calculate the residue such that `0 <= r_x < x`.
   - This is equivalent to `(x - (num % x)) % x` but avoids negative numbers directly.
   - The calculation `r_y = num % y` is straightforward and correct.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The program correctly counts pairs `(i, j)` where:
     - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`
     - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`
   - By using the `residue_map`, the program efficiently counts the pairs without explicitly iterating over all possible pairs `(i, j)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results for each test case and prints them out.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. The use of residues and the dictionary to count occurrences ensures that all conditions are met efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and efficiently implements the required logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions.
