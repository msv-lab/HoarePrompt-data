Output State: **`hd` is `a1 - a2`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is the sum of all occurrences where `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` for all valid `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.**

Explanation: The code `hd = a1 - a2` simply assigns the value of `a1 - a2` to the variable `hd`. The other variables (`n`, `res`, `a1`, `a2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
