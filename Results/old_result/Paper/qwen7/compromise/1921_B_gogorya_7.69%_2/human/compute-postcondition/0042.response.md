Output State: **`hd` is `a1 - a2`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` to be the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, which is `abs(a1 - a2)`. The other variables (`hd`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
