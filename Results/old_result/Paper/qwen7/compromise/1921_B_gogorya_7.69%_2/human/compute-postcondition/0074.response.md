Output State: **`hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 3`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 6**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`hd`, `res`, `a1`, `a2`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
