Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is true and `hd` is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1, and the loop or iteration continues. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is false or `hd` is not greater than 0, the condition remains unchanged, and the loop or iteration continues.
