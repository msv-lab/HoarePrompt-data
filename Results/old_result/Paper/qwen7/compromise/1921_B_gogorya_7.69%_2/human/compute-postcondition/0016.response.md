Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, if `hd` is greater than 0, we continue the loop or iteration we were inside. If `hd` is not greater than 0, the condition remains unchanged, and the condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is checked.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `n`, `hd`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
