Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `res` is the sum of all occurrences where `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` for all valid `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `hd` is the difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` at the end of the loop, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `res`, `hd`, or `t`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged. The only change is that `n` is now an input integer.
