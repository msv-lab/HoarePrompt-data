Postcondition: **`hd` is `a1 - a2 - 3` (or `a1 - a2 - 5` if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'), `n` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 1`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 3, and either `hd` is greater than 0, in which case we continue to the next iteration of the loop, or there is no change in the variables as there is no else part.**
