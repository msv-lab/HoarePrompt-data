Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition involves `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Postconditions from the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `res` is increased by 1 if `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`.
   - The condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is checked whether `hd` is greater than 0 or not.
     - If `hd` is greater than 0, the loop continues as before.
     - If `hd` is not greater than 0, the condition remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same unless it changes within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - The postconditions related to `res`, `s1`, `s2`, and `hd` are not directly affected by the loop head variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, these conditions remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1 if `s1[i+1] == '1'` and `s2[i+1] == '0'`, and the condition `s1[i+1] == '1' and s2[i+1] == '0'` is checked whether `hd` is greater than 0 or not. If `hd` is greater than 0, the loop or iteration continues as before; if not, the condition remains unchanged.**
