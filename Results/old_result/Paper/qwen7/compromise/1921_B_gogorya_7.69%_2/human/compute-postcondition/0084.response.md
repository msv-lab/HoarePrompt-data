Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables `i`, `n`, and `hd` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1 are still valid.
