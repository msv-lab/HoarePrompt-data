Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is a string entered by the user, `a1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a1 - a2` to the variable `hd`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `hd` is introduced and its value is the difference between the number of occurrences of '1' in `s1` and `s2`.
