State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
2. The only variable involved in the loop condition is `t`.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-negative integer, but since `t` is specified to be an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
4. The initial state of `t` being an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) does not guarantee that `t` is greater than 0; therefore, it needs to be explicitly adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
