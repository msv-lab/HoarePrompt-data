Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1 if `s1[i+1] == '1'` and `s2[i+1] == '0'`, `i` is increased by 1, `hd` is decreased by 1 if `s1[i+1] == '1' and s2[i+1] == '0'` and `hd` > 0; `hd` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `hd -= 1` decreases the value of `hd` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
