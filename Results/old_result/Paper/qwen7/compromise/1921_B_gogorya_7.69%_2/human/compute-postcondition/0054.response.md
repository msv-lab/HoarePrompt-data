Postcondition: `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 1`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 2, and `hd` is now `hd - 2` if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, the conditions remain as per the precondition.
