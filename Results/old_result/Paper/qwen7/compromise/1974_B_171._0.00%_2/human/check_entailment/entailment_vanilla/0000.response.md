Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string and returns the decoded string.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the reverse mapping of characters.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.

3. **Mapping Characters:**
   - For each character in the encoded string, it checks if the character is already in the `mapping`.
     - If it is, it appends the corresponding decoded character from the `mapping` to the `decoded` list.
     - If it is not, it tries to find the next available character in the alphabet that hasn't been used yet.
       - It iterates through the alphabet from 'a' to 'z'.
       - When it finds a character that is not already mapped, it maps this character to the current encoded character and appends the found character to the `decoded` list.

4. **Returning the Decoded String:**
   - After processing all characters in the encoded string, it joins the `decoded` list into a single string and returns it.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the next available character in the alphabet is flawed. It should map the characters based on their positions in the auxiliary string `r`, not by iterating through the entire alphabet.
   - The program needs to maintain the order of unique characters as they appear in the auxiliary string `r`.

2. **Auxiliary String Construction:**
   - The auxiliary string `r` is not constructed in the program. This is crucial because the mapping depends on the order of unique characters in `r`.

### Corrected Approach:

1. **Construct the Auxiliary String `r`:**
   - First, construct the auxiliary string `r` by collecting all unique characters from the encoded string and sorting them alphabetically.

2. **Create the Reverse Mapping:**
   - Create a reverse mapping where each character in `r` is paired with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

3. **Decode the String:**
   - Use the reverse mapping to decode the encoded string.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()

        # Construct the auxiliary string r
        r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))

        # Create the reverse mapping
        mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}

        # Decode the string
        decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)

        print(decoded)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the construction of the auxiliary string `r` and the reverse mapping. Therefore, the corrected approach is necessary.

**Correctness: False**
