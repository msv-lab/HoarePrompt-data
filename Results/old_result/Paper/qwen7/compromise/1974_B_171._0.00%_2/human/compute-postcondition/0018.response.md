Output State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary containing the key `'b'` with the value `'a'`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `decoded` and `mapping`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.
