Output State: **`c` is 'c', `mapping`['c'] is 'char'**.

In this case, the code assigns the character `'c'` as a key in the dictionary `mapping` and assigns the value `'char'` to it. The variable `c` remains unchanged and is still `'c'`. The dictionary `mapping` now contains one entry: `'c': 'char'`.
