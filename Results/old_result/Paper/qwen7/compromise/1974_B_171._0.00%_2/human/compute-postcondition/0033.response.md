Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined as `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`. The variable `c` is the only variable being modified in this loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `c` is within the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `c` is currently 97.
   - The character corresponding to `c` ('a') is not in the values of `mapping`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `c`**: Since `c` starts from `ord('a')` (which is 97) and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `c` will be 98.

5. **Check if the Next Value of `c` Meets the Loop Condition**: The next value of `c` (98) should still be within the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1` (which is 123). Therefore, the loop will continue to execute.

6. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `c`, which will be incremented to 98. The postcondition that the character corresponding to `c` ('b') is not in the values of `mapping` remains unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`c` is 98, and the character corresponding to `c` ('b') is not in the values of `mapping`**.
