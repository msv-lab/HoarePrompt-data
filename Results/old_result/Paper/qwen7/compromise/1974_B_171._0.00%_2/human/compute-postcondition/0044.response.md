Output State: **`c` is 97 (ord('a')), `decoded` contains the character 'z', the dictionary `mapping` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' as keys, each mapped to the character 'a', and the string `encoded` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `decoded.append(chr(c))` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `c` to the list `decoded`. Given that `c` is initially 122 (which is the ASCII value of 'z'), `chr(c)` evaluates to 'z'. After appending 'z' to `decoded`, `c` is decremented to 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') due to the nature of the loop that had `c` set to 122. All other variables remain unchanged.
