Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `c` in the range `range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)`. This means `c` will take on values from the ASCII value of 'a' to the ASCII value of 'z'.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `decoded` is an empty list.
   - `mapping` is a dictionary.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `c` is within the specified range. The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition given, if `chr(98)` ('b') is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` is updated with the key `'b'` and the value `'a'`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `c`**: Since `c` is iterating through the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z')`, the next value of `c` would be the ASCII value of the next character in the sequence, which is `ord('b')`.

5. **Check the Postcondition**: For the loop to continue, `chr(98)` ('b') should not be in the values of `mapping`. If it is not present, `mapping` will be updated with the key `'b'` and the value `'a'`.

6. **Update the State**: If `chr(98)` ('b') is not in the values of `mapping`, then after the update, `mapping` will contain the key `'b'` with the value `'a'`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `decoded` remains an empty list.
- `mapping` is updated to include the key `'b'` with the value `'a'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary containing the key `'b'` with the value `'a'`**.
