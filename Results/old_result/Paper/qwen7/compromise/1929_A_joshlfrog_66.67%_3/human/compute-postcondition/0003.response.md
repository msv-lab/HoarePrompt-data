Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.**

The code creates a list `nums` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `t`, `e`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
