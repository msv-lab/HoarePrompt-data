Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is 0.**

The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `x`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `e`, `l`, and `nums` remain unchanged, and `x` is set to `0`.
