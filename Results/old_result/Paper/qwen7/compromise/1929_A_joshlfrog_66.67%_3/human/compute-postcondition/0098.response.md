Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is equal to `t`, `l` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list during the loop's execution, and `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list during the loop's execution.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `e` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs `t` times. The variable `l` will remain unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the `nums` list across all the lists processed by the loop. Similarly, the variable `y` will hold the minimum value found in the `nums` list across all the lists processed by the loop. The other variables (`t` and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
