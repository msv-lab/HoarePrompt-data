Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `l-1`, where `l` is the length of the list `nums`.
- `x` is set to the maximum value found in the list `nums`.
- `y` remains unchanged at its initial value of 100000000.

The expression `x - y` will be evaluated as follows:
- `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
- `y` is 100000000.

So, the print statement will output the result of subtracting `y` from `x`.

Output: **x - 100000000 (where x is the maximum value found in the list nums)**
