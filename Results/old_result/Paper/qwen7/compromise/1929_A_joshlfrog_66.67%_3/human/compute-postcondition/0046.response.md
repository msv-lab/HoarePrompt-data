Output State: **`i` is 0; `l` is a positive integer; `y` is equal to `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Given that `i` is 0, `y` is now equal to `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `l` remains a positive integer, and the condition that `nums[0]` is greater than or equal to `y` is still valid since `y` is now `nums[0]`.
