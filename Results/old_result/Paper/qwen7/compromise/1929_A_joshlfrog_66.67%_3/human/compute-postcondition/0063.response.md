Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` equal to `l-1`, and `x` set to the maximum value found in the list `nums`. The variable `y` remains unchanged at its initial value of 100000000.**

This means that after the loop has fully executed, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `nums` minus one, indicating that the loop has iterated through each element in `nums`. The variable `x` will hold the largest number found in the list `nums`, as the loop updates `x` whenever it finds a number greater than the current `x`. Since `y` is only updated if a number in `nums` is less than `y`, and `y` starts at 100000000, it will remain unchanged unless there is a number in `nums` smaller than 100000000, which would make `y` that smaller number. However, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that such a number exists, so `y` remains 100000000.
