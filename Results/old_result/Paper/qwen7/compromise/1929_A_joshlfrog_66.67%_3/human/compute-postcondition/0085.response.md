Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `l` is `l`, `x` is `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than `100000000`, otherwise `x` remains `100000000`, `y` is `nums[i]`, `e` is `t`, `l` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Since `x` was previously set to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than `y` (which is `100000000`), or remains `100000000` otherwise, `x` does not change unless `nums[i]` is greater than `100000000`. All other variables remain unchanged.
