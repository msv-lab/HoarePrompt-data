Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `l`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should start at 0 (as is typical for `range(l)`).
   - `l` is already given as an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < l`. Therefore, `i` must start at 0 and `l` must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `e` is 1.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 100000000.

We need to adjust the states of `i` and `l` for the loop to execute.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` should be 0.
- `l` must be a positive integer.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is 0, `l` is a positive integer**
