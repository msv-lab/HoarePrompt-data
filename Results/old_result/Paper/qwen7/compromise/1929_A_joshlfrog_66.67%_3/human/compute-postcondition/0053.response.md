Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is `nums[1]`, `y` is `nums[1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Given that `i` is 1 and `x` is `nums[1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `nums[1]`, which is the same as `x`. Therefore, `i` and `x` remain unchanged, and `y` is now holding the value of `nums[1]`.
