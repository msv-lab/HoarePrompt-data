Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `l`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (implicitly) when the loop starts.
   - `l` is given as the value of the variable `l`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for i in range(l)` will execute as long as `i < l`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `l`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it will always be less than `l` if `l` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, the only variable that needs adjustment is `l`, ensuring it is at least 1.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `l` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000**
