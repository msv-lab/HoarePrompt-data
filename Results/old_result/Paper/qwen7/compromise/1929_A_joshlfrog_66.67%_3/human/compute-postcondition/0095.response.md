Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `l`, `x` will hold the maximum value from the list `nums`, and `y` will hold the minimum value from the list `nums`. The variable `e` remains `t`, `l` remains an input integer, and `nums` is the list of integers created from user input.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will have exceeded the length of the list `nums` (since it increments from `l-1` down to 0), indicating that the entire list has been processed. The variable `x` will contain the largest element found in `nums`, while `y` will contain the smallest element found in `nums`. All other variables (`e` and `l`) and the list `nums` will retain their original values from the initial state.
