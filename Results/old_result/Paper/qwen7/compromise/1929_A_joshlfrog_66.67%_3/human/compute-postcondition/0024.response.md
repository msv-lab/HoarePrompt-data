Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `i` is 1, `x` is the element at index 1 of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Given that `i` is 1, `x` is set to the second element in the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
