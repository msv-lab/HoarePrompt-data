Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) defined as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by placing the largest element at one end and the smallest element at the other end, with the remaining elements in between in any order.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to find the maximum and minimum values in the array and then calculates their difference. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program only finds the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in the array and prints `x - y`. This does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty.
2. **Lack of Rearrangement Logic**: The program does not attempt to rearrange the elements to achieve the maximum beauty.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the example provided:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 3`, `min = 1`
   - Output: `3 - 1 = 2` (Correct)
   
2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 69`, `min = 69`
   - Output: `69 - 69 = 0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 100`, `min = 43`
   - Output: `100 - 43 = 57` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 4`, `min = 3`
   - Output: `4 - 3 = 1` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `[2, 1]`
   - Maximum and Minimum: `max = 2`, `min = 1`
   - Output: `2 - 1 = 1` (Correct)

### Conclusion
While the program produces the correct output for the given examples, it does not solve the problem correctly because it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array to maximize the beauty. The program simply finds the maximum and minimum values and calculates their difference, which is not always the optimal solution.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
