Reasoning:
The given program attempts to find the maximum beauty of the array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the maximum possible beauty as defined in the problem statement. The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the array, and rearranging the elements can change these differences.

To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest element at one end and the smallest element at the other end, ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The given solution only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and calculates their difference, which is not the same as maximizing the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Given the problem's requirements, the correct approach would involve sorting the array and calculating the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting.

Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
