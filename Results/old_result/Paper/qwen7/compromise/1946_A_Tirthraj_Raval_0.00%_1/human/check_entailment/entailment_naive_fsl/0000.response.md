Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it counts the occurrences of the median value in the sorted array, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the median value after sorting the array and then determine how many operations are needed to make each element at or above the median position equal to the median value. The program should:

1. Sort the array.
2. Determine the median index.
3. Calculate the difference between the median value and the smallest value that needs to be changed to reach the median.
4. Sum these differences to get the minimum number of operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        median_index = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median_value = a[median_index]
        min_operations = 0
        for i in range(median_index + 1):
            min_operations += max(0, median_value - a[i])
        print(min_operations)

func()
```

This corrected program should meet the requirements of the problem description and handle all potential cases correctly.
