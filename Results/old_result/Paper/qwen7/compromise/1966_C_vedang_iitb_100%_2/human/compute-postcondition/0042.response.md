Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sz` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the variable `sz`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in the list `a`, the value of `sz` will change to the next element in the list.
   - The list `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The condition for increasing `mexsize` will be checked again based on the new value of `sz`.

4. **New State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `sz` will now be the second element of the list `a`.
   - `a` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` will be increased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`sz` is the second element of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and if `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1**.
