Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `sz` will be the last element of the list `a`, and `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `sz` will hold the value of the last element in the sorted list `a`. The variable `mexsize` will have been incremented by 1 for each instance where the current element `sz` in the list `a` is equal to the current value of `mexsize`. This process continues until all elements in the list `a` have been processed.
