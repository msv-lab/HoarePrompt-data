Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `sz` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers.
   - If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `sz` is the second element of the list `a`, the next element in the list (the third element) will be considered in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `sz` will be the third element of the list `a`.

5. **Update the conditions**:
   - The list `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `mexsize` may change if the third element of the list `a` equals `mexsize`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `sz` is the third element of the list `a`.
- `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers.
- `mexsize` remains unchanged or may be incremented based on the value of the third element of `a`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`sz` is the third element of the list `a`, `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, and `mexsize` remains unchanged or may be incremented based on the value of the third element of `a`**.
