Output State: **`sz` is the third element of the list `a`, `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, and `mexsize` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `mexsize = mexsize + 1` increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. The values of `sz` and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
