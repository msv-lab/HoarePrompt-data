Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers a (length n) represents the initial number of stones in each pile, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxsize = max(a)
    a.sort()
    mexsize = 1
    for sz in a:
        if sz == mexsize:
            mexsize = mexsize + 1
    if mexsize > maxsize:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements removed, `maxsize` is 0 (since the list `a` is now empty), and `mexsize` is 5. Whether `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` or not, the values of `tc`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `a` has been fully iterated over, meaning `sz` is now the last element of the list `a`. `mexsize` has been incremented each time it matched an element `sz` in the list `a`. The final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. `mexsize` is compared to `maxsize`, and if `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the function continues with `mexsize` as is. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the function also continues with `mexsize` as is. The list `a` itself remains unchanged from its initial state, and `sz` will hold the last element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, and `mexsize` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`. Additionally, if `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the final value of `mexsize` remains unchanged from its previous state. Otherwise, `mexsize` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
