Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over the list `a` using `sz` as the variable for each element in the list. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `sz` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 0
   - `t` is an input integer
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is a non-empty sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`
   - `mexsize` is 2
   - If the length of the list `a` is equal to 1, then the length of `a` remains 1.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `a`, the first element `sz` is processed in the current iteration.
   - After processing the first element, `a` will lose its first element (assuming it was non-empty).
   - The length of `a` decreases by 1.
   - The new `sz` will be the next element in the updated list `a`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `tc` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `a` loses its first element, so it now contains all elements except the first one.
   - `maxsize` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `mexsize` remains 2 as it is not affected by the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with the first element removed, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, and `mexsize` is 2**
