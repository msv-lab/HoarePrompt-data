To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sz` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`.
   - `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
   ```

Given the conditions:
- `mexsize` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`.
- Since `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, it will eventually stabilize at some value depending on the occurrences of `sz` matching `mexsize`.

The key part of the print statement is the condition `mexsize % 2 == 1`. This checks if `mexsize` is odd. If `mexsize` is odd, it will print `'Alice'`; otherwise, it will print `'Bob'`.

Since the exact value of `mexsize` is not provided, we need to consider the general case:
- If `mexsize` is odd, the output will be `'Alice'`.
- If `mexsize` is even, the output will be `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output depends on whether `mexsize` is odd or even, but without the specific value of `mexsize`, we can only describe the condition.

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd, else 'Bob'**
