Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is the last element of the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and has been incremented each time it matched an element `sz` in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

The `print` statement checks if `mexsize` is odd (`mexsize % 2 == 1`). If it is odd, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Bob".

Since the exact value of `mexsize` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact string that will be printed. However, we know it will be either "Alice" or "Bob" depending on whether `mexsize` is odd or even.

Output: **Alice** if `mexsize` is odd, **Bob** if `mexsize` is even
