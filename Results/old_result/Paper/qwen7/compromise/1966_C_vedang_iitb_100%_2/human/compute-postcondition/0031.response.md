Output State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements removed, `maxsize` is 0, and `mexsize` is 5.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
