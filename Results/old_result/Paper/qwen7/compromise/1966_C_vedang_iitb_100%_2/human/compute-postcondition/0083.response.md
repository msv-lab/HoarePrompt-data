Postcondition: `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, and `mexsize` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`. Additionally, if `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the final value of `mexsize` remains unchanged from its previous state. Otherwise, `mexsize` is incremented by 1.
