Postcondition: `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, and `mexsize` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` during the if condition, then `mexsize` remains greater than `maxsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.
