Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `n // 4 - 1`**: The code uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine where to place 'F' or 'S' when filling in the remaining transition videos. This calculation does not align with the problem's requirement to ensure no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

2. **Incomplete Logic for Decision Making**: The logic for deciding whether to fill in 'F' or 'S' is incomplete and does not consider the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Transition Videos**: The code attempts to fill in the remaining transition videos based on the count of 'F' and 'S' already decided, but it does not properly handle the constraint of the maximum consecutive videos of the same type.

4. **Missing Consideration of All Permutations**: The code does not ensure that the solution works for all possible permutations of the scenarios, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

### Example of a Correct Approach:

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated algorithm to ensure the constraint is met for all permutations. One possible approach could involve using a backtracking algorithm to try different configurations and check if they meet the constraint. However, implementing such an approach requires a more detailed understanding of the problem and a more robust algorithmic design.

Here is a high-level outline of a potential correct approach:

1. **Count Decided Transitions**: Count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions already decided.
2. **Calculate Remaining Slots**: Determine how many 'F' and 'S' transitions need to be decided.
3. **Backtracking**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try different configurations and check if they meet the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

Given these issues, the provided code is incorrect and does not solve the problem as specified.
