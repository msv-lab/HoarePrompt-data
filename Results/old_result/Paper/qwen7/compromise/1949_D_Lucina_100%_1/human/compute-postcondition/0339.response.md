Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is 'SSF', and `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'**.

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string 'S', changing its value from either 'SS' or 'SF' to 'SSF'. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
