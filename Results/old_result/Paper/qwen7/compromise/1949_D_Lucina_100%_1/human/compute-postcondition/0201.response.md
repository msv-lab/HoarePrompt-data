Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is 1, `j` is between 1 and n inclusive, and the character at position `j-1` in `xx[i]` is `'?'`, and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string `'S'` to the existing value of `nx`, which was an empty string. Therefore, `nx` becomes `'S'`. The values of `i`, `j`, and the condition about the character in `xx[i]` remain unchanged.
