Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `1` to `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[1, n + 1)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is either `1` or `2`, and `n` must be at least `2`.

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2` if it was `1` in the previous iteration, or `3` if it was `2`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `j` must still be within the range `[1, n + 1)`. Given that `n` is at least `2`, `j` can be `2` or `3` (if `n` is at least `3`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given that `j` was either `1` or `2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2` if it was `1`, or `3` if it was `2`. However, since `n` is at least `2`, `j` can be `3` if `n` is at least `3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the possible values of `j` and `n`.

**State: **`j` is 2 or 3, `n` must be at least 2**
