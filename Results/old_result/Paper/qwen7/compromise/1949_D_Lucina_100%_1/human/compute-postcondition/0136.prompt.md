Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sa` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each being the input string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, and `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`; `sb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 24. If `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, then `sa` is a list containing the value 1, and `sb` is a list containing the value 1. If the condition `b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0` is not met, the lists `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `sa` is [2, 3], `sb` is [3], `n` must be between 2 and 24, and no changes are made to `sa`, `sb`, and `n` if `b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4; `sa` is [2, 3, 4, 4]; `sb` is [3]; `n` must be between 2 and 24. If `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, then `sa` includes the value at index `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
