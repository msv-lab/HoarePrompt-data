Output State: **`nx` is 'FS', `i` is 1, `j` is `k + 1`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'.
- If `i` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1 or `j` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the string formed by concatenating the character at position `i` in `xx` with the character at position `j-1` in `xx`, and `i` is 1, `j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. After the previous iteration, `j` was `k`, so for the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.
- The code `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the current value of `nx`. Since `nx` was initially 'F' or 'S', appending 'S' results in 'FS'.
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their last known values, which are `i` is 1 and `j` is `k`. For the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is `nx` is 'FS', `i` is 1, and `j` is `k + 1`.
