Postcondition: `n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j - 1]` is either a non-'?' character or '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is a string. If `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is a string with the value 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is a string with the value 'S' appended to it.
