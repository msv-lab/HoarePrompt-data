Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and `nx` is equal to `xx[i][0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j-1]` to it. Given that `j` is 1, `xx[i][j-1]` is equivalent to `xx[i][0]`. Therefore, `nx` is now equal to the value of `xx[i][0]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
