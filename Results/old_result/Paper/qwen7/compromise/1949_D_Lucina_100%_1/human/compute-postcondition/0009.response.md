Output State: **`j` is 1; `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `a[1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, `a[1]` is increased by 1. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
