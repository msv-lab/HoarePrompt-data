Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' plus the character at index `xx[2][1]`, `n` is a positive integer**.

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the character at index `xx[2][1]` (since `j - 1` equals 1) to the current value of `nx`. The initial value of `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, so the index being accessed is `xx[2][1]`. Since `nx` is initially either 'F' or 'S', it will now be either 'F' or 'S' concatenated with the character at `xx[2][1]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
