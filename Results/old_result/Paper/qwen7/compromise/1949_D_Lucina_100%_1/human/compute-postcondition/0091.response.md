Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is 3, `a[j]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `a[3]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `a[3]` was not specified, it is assumed to be 0 (as lists are initialized with 0 for non-existent indices), making `a[3]` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
