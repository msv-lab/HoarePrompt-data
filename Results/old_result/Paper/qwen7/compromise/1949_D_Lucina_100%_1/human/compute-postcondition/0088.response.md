Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `xx` is a list containing the string `x`.
   - `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`.
   - `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `2`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is set to `2`.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[1]` is incremented by `1`.

4. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `2`.
   - The loop will check if `j` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `1` to `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently `2`, the next value of `j` will be `3` (assuming `j` increments by `1` each iteration).

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `j`.
   - Therefore, we need to update `j` to `3`.

7. **Other Variables**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `xx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified within the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `3**.
