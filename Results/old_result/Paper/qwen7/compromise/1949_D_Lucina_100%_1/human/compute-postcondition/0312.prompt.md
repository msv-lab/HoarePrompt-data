Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is between 2 and 24, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. If `i` is in the range from `0` to `n // 4 - 1` or `j` is in the same range, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` remains 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `nx` is either 'F' followed by 'S' or 'S' followed by 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. If `i` is in the range from `0` to `n // 4 - 1` or `j` (now 2) is in the same range, `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` remains as it was originally, which could be 'F' or 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between `2` and `24`, `nx` is either 'FS' followed by 'S' or 'SS' followed by 'S', and `xx[i][n]` remains undefined. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, `nx` remains as 'FS' followed by 'S' or 'SS' followed by 'S'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
