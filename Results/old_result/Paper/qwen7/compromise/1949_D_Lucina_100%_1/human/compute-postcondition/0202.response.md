Postcondition: `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` is between 1 and n//4 - 1, or `j` is between 1 and n//4 - 1, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. `i` is either between 1 and n//4 - 1 or 1, and `j` is between 1 and n inclusive. The character at position `j-1` in `xx[i]` is `'?'`, and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa` if `nx` is 'S'.
