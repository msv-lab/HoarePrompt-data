Output State: **`nx` is a string where its last character is added with the character at index `i` (which is 1) and `j - 1` (which is `k + 1`) in `xx`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `k + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at index `j - 1` of `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is `k + 2`, `j - 1` becomes `k + 1`. Therefore, the character at index `k + 1` of `xx[1]` is appended to `nx`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
