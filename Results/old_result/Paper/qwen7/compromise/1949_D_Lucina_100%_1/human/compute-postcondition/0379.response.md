Based on the initial state provided:

- `nx` is a string that has been built up through the iterations of the loop.
- `j` is `n`.

The print statement is `print(nx)`. Since `nx` is described as a string built up through the iterations of the loop, but no specific loop or building process is mentioned, we can only refer to the current state of `nx`.

Given the information, the output will simply be the current value of the string `nx`.

Output: **nx (where nx is the string built up through the iterations of the loop)**
