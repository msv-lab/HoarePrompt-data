Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is 'SS', and `xx[i][j - 1]` remains as '?'**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to its current value. Since `nx` was initially either 'S' or 'F', after adding 'S', it becomes 'SS' or 'FS'. However, since the exact initial value of `nx` is not specified, we consider both possibilities. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
