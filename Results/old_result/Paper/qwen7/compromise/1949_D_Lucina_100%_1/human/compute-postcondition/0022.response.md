Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `a[2]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `a[2]` is incremented by 1. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 24\) is still valid.
