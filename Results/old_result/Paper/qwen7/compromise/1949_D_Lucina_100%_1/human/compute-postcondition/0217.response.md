Output State: **`nx` is 'S' + the original string value of `nx`, `i` is 1, `j` is `k + 2`**.

Explanation: The string `nx` is concatenated with the string 'S'. Since `nx` was initially a string, the value of `nx` now becomes the original string value of `nx` concatenated with 'S'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
