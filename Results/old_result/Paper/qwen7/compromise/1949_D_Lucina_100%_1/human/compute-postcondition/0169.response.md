Postcondition: `n` must be between 2 and 24, `(xx[i][j - 1])` is equal to `'?'`, and `nx` is a string that is either appended with 'F' or 'S' depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. If either `i` or `j` is in the specified range, `nx` is appended with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is appended with 'S'.
