The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'. If `nx` was 'F', it now becomes 'FS'. If `nx` was already 'S', it becomes 'SS'. The conditions regarding the ranges of `i` and `j` do not affect the value of `nx` because the code only modifies `nx` regardless of these conditions.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `nx` is either 'F' followed by 'S' or 'S' followed by 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'.**
