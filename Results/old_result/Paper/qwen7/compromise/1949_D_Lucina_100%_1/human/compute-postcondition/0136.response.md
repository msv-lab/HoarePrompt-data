Output State: **The final state of the loop will be as follows: `i` will be equal to `n + 1`, `sa` will contain all indices `i` (from 2 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` will contain all indices `i` (from 2 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be between 2 and 24.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `sa` will include every index `i` from 2 to `n` where the count of 'F' characters (`a[i]`) is greater than 0 and the count of 'S' characters (`b[i]`) is 0. Similarly, the list `sb` will include every index `i` from 2 to `n` where the count of 'S' characters (`b[i]`) is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters (`a[i]`) is 0. The variable `i` will have incremented to `n + 1`, and `n` will still be within the range of 2 to 24.
