Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `nx` or '?'.
   - If `j` is 1, then `nx` is 'S'.
   - If `j` is 2 and neither `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`, if the loop has just finished an iteration where `j` was 2 (the maximum value), it will start over with `j = 1`.
   - If `j` was 1 in the previous iteration, the next iteration will increment `j` to 2.

5. **Check the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - If `j` was 1, it will now be 2.
   - If `j` was 2, it will wrap around to 1.

6. **Update the states accordingly**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so if `j` was 1, it will become 2, and if `j` was 2, it will become 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The condition for `xx[i][j - 1]` will depend on the new value of `j`.

Given these considerations, let's formulate the new state:

- If `j` was 1, it becomes 2.
- If `j` was 2, it becomes 1.
- `n` remains at least 2.
- The condition for `xx[i][j - 1]` will be checked based on the new value of `j`.

Since `j` can either be 1 or 2, we need to consider both cases:

**Case 1: If `j` was 1**
- New `j` value: 2
- `xx[i][j - 1]` will be checked as `xx[i][1]` (which is `nx` and could be 'S' or '?').

**Case 2: If `j` was 2**
- New `j` value: 1
- `xx[i][j - 1]` will be checked as `xx[i][0]` (which is `nx` and could be 'S' or '?').

However, since the loop will always increment `j` by 1, we can generalize the state for the next iteration:

State: **`j` is 1 or 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `nx` or '?'**.

To be more specific, we can state it as:

State: **`j` is 1 or 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `nx` or '?'**.

This covers both possible scenarios for the next iteration of the loop.
