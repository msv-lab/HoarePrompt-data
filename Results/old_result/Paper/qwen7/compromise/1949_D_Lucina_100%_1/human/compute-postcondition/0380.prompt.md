Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is between 2 and 24, `sa` will contain all indices \( i \) (from 2 to \( n \)) where \( a[i] > 0 \) and \( b[i] == 0 \), and `sb` will contain all indices \( i \) (from 2 to \( n \)) where \( b[i] > 0 \) and \( a[i] == 0 \). If \( a[i] == 0 \) and \( b[i] == 0 \), then `sb` now includes index \( i \).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n + 1`. During each iteration, the loop checks if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If both conditions are met, the index `i` is appended to `sb`. Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`, it will check all indices from 1 to `n + 1`. However, the loop only appends indices from 2 to `n` to `sb` based on the given conditions. Therefore, after the loop completes, `sb` will contain all indices \( i \) (from 2 to \( n \)) where \( b[i] > 0 \) and \( a[i] == 0 \), provided these conditions were met during the loop's execution. The value of `n` remains unchanged as per the problem statement.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is between 2 and 24, `nx` is a string composed of 'F', 'S', and possibly characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` where `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, j is n, n is at least 2, nx is a string of length n-1 consisting of 'S', 'F', or '?', and xx[1][0] remains unchanged and stays as '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nx` is a string that has been built up through the iterations of the loop, and `j` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
