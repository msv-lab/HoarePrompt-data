`nx` is initially either 'S' or 'F'. The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the current value of `nx`. If `nx` was 'S', it will become 'SF'. If `nx` was 'F', it will remain 'F'. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nx` is either 'SF' if it was originally 'S', or 'F' if it was originally 'F'; `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**
