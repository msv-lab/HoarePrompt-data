Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[2][1]`, `n` is a positive integer.

This postcondition covers both cases: if `xx[2][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to include the character at `xx[2][1]`; otherwise, `nx` remains as either 'F' or 'S'.
