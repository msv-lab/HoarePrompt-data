Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is between 2 and 24, `nx` is an empty string, and neither `i` nor `j` is in the range from `0` to `n // 4 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `i` and `j` also remain the same.
