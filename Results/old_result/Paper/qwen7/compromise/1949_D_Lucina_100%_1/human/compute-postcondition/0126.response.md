Output State: **`i` is 3, `sa` is [2, 3], `sb` is [3], `n` must be between 2 and 24.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` is an empty list, so after appending `i`, `sb` becomes `[3]`. The values of `i`, `sa`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
