Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is a string.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `k + 1`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the string formed by concatenating the character at position `i` in `xx` with the character at position `j - 1` in `xx`. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS'.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `k + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become `k + 2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `j`. Therefore, we need to update the value of `j` to `k + 2`.
   - The other variables (`nx`, `i`, and `xx`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Final state**:
   - `nx` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` becomes `k + 2`.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is 1, and `j` is `k + 2`.**
