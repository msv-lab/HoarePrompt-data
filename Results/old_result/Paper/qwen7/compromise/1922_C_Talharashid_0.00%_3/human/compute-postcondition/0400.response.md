Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 2 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` must be at least 1 less than `end`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is 11111111.**

Explanation: The line `mini = 11111111` assigns the value `11111111` to the variable `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
