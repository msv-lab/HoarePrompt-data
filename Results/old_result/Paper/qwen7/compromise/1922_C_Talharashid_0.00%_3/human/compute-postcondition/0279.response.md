Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer, `end` is an input integer, and `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` based on whether `start < end` is true or false.**

Explanation: The code `start, end = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `start` and `end` respectively. The initial values of `i`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged except that `end` is updated to `end - 1`. The values of `start` and `end` are now dependent on the user's input, and the conditions for `s1` and `s2` remain based on the relationship between `start` and `end`.
