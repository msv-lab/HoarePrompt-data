Output State: **`inc` is -1, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` is 1, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1` is a dictionary where keys are indices from `start` to `end` and values are cumulative sums of distances up to those indices, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the current value of `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

This means that the variable `s` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
