Postcondition: `i` is 5, `m` is greater than 3, `end` is decreased by 1, `s` is 0, and either `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`), or `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`).
