Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is 2, `start` must be decremented further until it is not equal to 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Given that `s` was initially equal to either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, it now becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
