Output State: **`start` is increased by `inc`, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and 11111111, and `s` is increased by either 1 (if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`) or by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` (if `mini != abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`).**

This means that the value of `start` has been incremented by `inc`. The values of `mini` and `s` remain as per their postconditions, with `mini` being the minimum of the specified values and `s` being adjusted based on the condition involving `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
