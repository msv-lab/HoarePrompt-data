Output State: **`inc` is -1, `start` is -1, `end` is 0, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1[start]` is equal to `mini`, `d2[start]` is equal to the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state except for the entry at index `-1`, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code sets `mini` to 11111111. Since this is the only change, all other variables retain their initial values or states.
