Output State: **`start` is `initial_value - m`, `end` is `initial_value - m - 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is the input integer `m`, `d1` is an empty defaultdict, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch.**

The code initializes `d1` as an empty `defaultdict` of integers. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.
