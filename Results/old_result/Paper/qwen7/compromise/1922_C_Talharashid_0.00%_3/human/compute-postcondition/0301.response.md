Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `end` is `end - 1`.
- `s` is 0.
- `start` is `start - 1`.

We need to determine the values of `s1` and `s2` before executing the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement.

From the postcondition:
- If `start < end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.
- Otherwise, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

Given the values:
- `end` is `end - 1`.
- `start` is `start - 1`.

Let's assume `start` and `end` are such that `start < end`. This is the only scenario where both `s1` and `s2` are defined.

So, we have:
- `s1 = abs(d1[end - 1] - d1[start - 1])`
- `s2 = abs(d2[start - 1] - d2[end - 1])`

Since the exact values of `d1` and `d2` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `s1` and `s2`. However, we know that `min(s1, s2)` will return the smaller of these two values.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum of `s1` and `s2` based on the values of `d1` and `d2` at the specified indices.

Output: **min(abs(d1[end - 1] - d1[start - 1]), abs(d2[start - 1] - d2[end - 1]))**
