Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `start` must be different from `end`, `mini` is the minimum of either `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` depending on the condition, and `start` is less than `end` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `start - 1` is greater than -1. Additionally, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` added to the original `s`, and the current value of `inc` is 1.
