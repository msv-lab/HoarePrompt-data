Output State: **`mini` holds the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `start` is equal to `end - 1` because the loop condition `start != end` is no longer true when the loop terminates, `end` remains unchanged from its initial value, `inc` remains unchanged from its initial value, `s` contains the sum of distances calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial value, `d1` is a dictionary where keys are indices from `start` to `end` and values are cumulative sums of distances up to those indices, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1`.**

This output state reflects that the `start` index has been updated to `len(lst) - 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
