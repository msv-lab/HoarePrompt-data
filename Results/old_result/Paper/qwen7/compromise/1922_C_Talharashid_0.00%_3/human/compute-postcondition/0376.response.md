Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `start` is decremented by 1 if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains 4, `t` remains unchanged, `m` remains greater than 3, `end` remains 0, `s` remains 0, `start` is decremented by 1 if it is greater than -1, and the dictionaries `d1` and `d2` remain as initially defined. The variable `inc` remains -1, and `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` (or 11111111 if `start - 1` is out of bounds).
