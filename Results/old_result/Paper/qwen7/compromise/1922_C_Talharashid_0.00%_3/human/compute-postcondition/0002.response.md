Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code initializes a default dictionary `d1` with an integer as its default factory. This means that `d1` can be accessed with keys that do not exist yet, and they will automatically be initialized with the default value `0`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
