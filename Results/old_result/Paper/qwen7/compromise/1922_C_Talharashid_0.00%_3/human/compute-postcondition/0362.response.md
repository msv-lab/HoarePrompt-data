Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of 1 and the absolute differences between consecutive elements starting from `lst[0]` up to the last element processed, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, and `mini` is the minimum value found during the loop execution.**

Explanation: The line `start = len(lst) - 1` updates the value of `start` to be the length of the list `lst` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
