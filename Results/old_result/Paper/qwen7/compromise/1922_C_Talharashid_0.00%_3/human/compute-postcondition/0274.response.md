Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` to `s2`. The value of `start` and `end` remains unchanged from their initial conditions. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `s1`) retain their initial or previously calculated values.
