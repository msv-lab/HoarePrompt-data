Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int; `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int; `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `t`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
