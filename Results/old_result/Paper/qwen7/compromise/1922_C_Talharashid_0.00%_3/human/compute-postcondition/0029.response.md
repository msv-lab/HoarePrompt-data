Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` added to the original `s`, `start` must be different from `end`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and the original `mini`, and `start` is less than `end` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `start - 1` is greater than -1.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. Depending on whether the condition `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` is true or false, the value of `s` will either be 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` added to the original `s`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `end`, `start`, `mini`) retain their conditions as specified in the precondition, with the additional constraint that `start` is less than `end` if `start + 1 < len(lst)` and `start - 1` is greater than -1.
