Output State: **`start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `m` is the input integer `m`.**

Explanation: The line `s = 0` initializes the variable `s` to 0. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `inc`, `mini`, `i`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
