Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while start != end:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is -1
- `start` is `start - 1` (implying `start` was decremented)
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`
- `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`
- If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`
- `d2[start]` is equal to `s`
- `s` is increased by either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or not

### Determining the Next State
For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must not be equal to `end`. Given that `end` is 0, `start` must be different from 0.

### Adjusting the State
- The only variable in the loop head is `start`, so we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to 0.

### Updated State
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `start` must be different from 0. Since `start` is derived from `start - 1` in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `start` is set to a value that is not 0.

State: **`end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is not equal to 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, and if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, and `s` is increased by either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or not.**

However, since we only need to adjust the loop head variable `start`, the final state simplifies to:

State: **`end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is not equal to 0**
