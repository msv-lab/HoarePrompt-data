Output State: **`i` is 5, `m` is greater than 3, `end` is decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`**.

The code calculates the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. Since the exact values of `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` are not provided, `s2` is expressed as the absolute difference between these two elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
