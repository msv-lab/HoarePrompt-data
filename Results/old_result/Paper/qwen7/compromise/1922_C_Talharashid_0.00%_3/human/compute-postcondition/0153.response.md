Postcondition: `start` is the input integer - 3, `end` is the input integer - 4, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is the input integer `m`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, depending on the condition `start < end`.
