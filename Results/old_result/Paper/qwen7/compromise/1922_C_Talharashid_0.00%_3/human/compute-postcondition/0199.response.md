Output State: **`start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to `end`; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and its current value (`11111111`). The precondition that `start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to `end` remains unchanged. The value of `mini` is now dependent on the values of `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`.
