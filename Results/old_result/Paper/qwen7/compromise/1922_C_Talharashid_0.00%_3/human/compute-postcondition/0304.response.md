Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is `end - 3`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` with an integer factory function. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`i`, `t`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `start`). Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state, except for the addition of the `d1` variable which is now a `defaultdict` with integers as its default factory.
