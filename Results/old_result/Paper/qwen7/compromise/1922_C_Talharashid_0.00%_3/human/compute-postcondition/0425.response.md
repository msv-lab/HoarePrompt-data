Output State: **`i` is 4, `m` is greater than 4, `start` is 3, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(`d2[end]` - `d2[start]`).**

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` to `s1`. However, since `d2` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s1`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `start`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
