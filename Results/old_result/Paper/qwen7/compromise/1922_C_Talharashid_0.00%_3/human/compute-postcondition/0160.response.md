Output State: **`start` is `initial_value - m`, `end` is `initial_value - m - 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is the input integer `m`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch.**

Explanation: The line `d2 = defaultdict(int)` creates a new defaultdict named `d2` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `d2` is now a dictionary where any key that does not exist will default to an integer value (0). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
