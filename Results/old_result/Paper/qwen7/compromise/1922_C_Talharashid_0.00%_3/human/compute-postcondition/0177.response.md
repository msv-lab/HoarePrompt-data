Output State: **`s` is increased by 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `start` is unchanged and is less than the length of `lst`, `end` is unchanged, `inc` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `d2` is unchanged, `s2` is unchanged, `s1` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged.**

The value of `s` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is still determined by the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and its previous value.
