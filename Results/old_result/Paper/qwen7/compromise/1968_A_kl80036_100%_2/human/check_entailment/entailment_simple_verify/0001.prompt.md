You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: t test cases are executed, and for each test case, the value of x-1 is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program takes an integer \( t \) as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints \( y \).

3. **Key Consideration**:
   - The goal is to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, y)\) will be at most 1 because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers and thus coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).
   - Therefore, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x\).

4. **Checking the Solution**:
   - The solution provided always sets \( y = x - 1 \).
   - This choice ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), making \(\gcd(x, y) + y = x\), which is indeed the maximum possible value since \(\gcd(x, y) \leq y < x\).

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 9 \) and \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 20 \) and \(\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21\).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 99 \) and \(\gcd(100, 99) + 99 = 1 + 99 = 100\).

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
