You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a number of test cases (t) and for each test case, it reads an integer (x) within the range [2, 1000], calculates x-1, and prints the result. After completing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the value of \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Instead, it simply prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case, which is not necessarily the optimal solution.

For example, consider \( x = 10 \). The program would output \( y = 9 \), but the optimal \( y \) is actually \( 5 \), because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is greater than \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
