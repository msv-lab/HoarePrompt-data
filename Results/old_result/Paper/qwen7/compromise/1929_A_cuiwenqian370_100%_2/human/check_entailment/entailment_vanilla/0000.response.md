Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).
   - To maximize this, we should arrange the elements such that the positive differences outweigh the negative ones.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty using the sorted array. This is because sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - It iterates through the sorted array and computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach is correct for finding the maximum beauty.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - The logic for reading and processing input is correct.

### Verification

Given the above analysis, let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  3
  2 1 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Beauty = \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  69 69 69
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Execution:
  - The array is already sorted.
  - Beauty = \( (69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  100 54 80 43 90
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  57
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
  - Beauty = \( (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \).

#### Example 4:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  3 4 3 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
  - Beauty = \( (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \).

#### Example 5:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2]`.
  - Beauty = \( (2 - 1) = 1 \).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the solution by sorting the array and calculating the beauty using the sorted array. It also correctly handles multiple test cases.

**Correctness: **True**
