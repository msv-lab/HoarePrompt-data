Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). To maximize this, we need to sort the array and calculate the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The logic is correct because sorting ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, leading to the maximum possible sum of differences.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - It correctly handles reading the number of test cases (`t`), the size of each array (`n`), and the array elements.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each array and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - `func_1` correctly computes the beauty of a given array.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the results for each test case.

Given that both functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
