The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two lists of integers \( a_i \) and \( b_i \). It sorts the list \( b \) and then calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of \( a_i \) and the closest elements in \( b \). Specifically, for each element in \( a_i \), it finds the closest element in \( b \) and adds the absolute difference to the total sum. The function returns the total sum of these differences for all test cases.
