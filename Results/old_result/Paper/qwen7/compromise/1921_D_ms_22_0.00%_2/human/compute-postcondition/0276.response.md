Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty and does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from `max_heap` (since it is a max-heap, the smallest element is actually the root node). After this operation, `max_heap` no longer contains the item that was just popped. The variable `item` now holds the value of the smallest element from the heap before it was removed.
