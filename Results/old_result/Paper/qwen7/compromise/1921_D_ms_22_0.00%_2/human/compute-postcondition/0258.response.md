Postcondition: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` where `item[1]` is the element popped from `max_heap` and `item[2]` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which element of `b` was closer to the popped element, `tp1` is `0` or `1`, `tp2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans + diff2` or `ans - item[0]`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
