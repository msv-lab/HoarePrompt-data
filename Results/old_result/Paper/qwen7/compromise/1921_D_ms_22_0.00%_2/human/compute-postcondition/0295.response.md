Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases (t) where for each test case, it takes two integers (n and m) and two lists of integers (a_i and b_i). It returns different outputs based on the conditions provided for n, m, a_i, and b_i.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` within the range 1 to 100. For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m` where `n` is less than or equal to `m` and both are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, it processes two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` where each element is within the range 1 to 10^9. The exact nature of the operations and the return value depend on the specific logic implemented within the function body, which is not detailed here.
