Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` must now contain at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is `1` (since `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1), `tp2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`, and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.**

This output state reflects that `tp1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
