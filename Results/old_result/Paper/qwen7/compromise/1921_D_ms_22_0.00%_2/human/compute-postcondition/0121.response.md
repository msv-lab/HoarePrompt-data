Output State: **`i` is `i_next`, `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the current value of `i` (which is `i_next`) and the first element of the list `b` (`b[0]`). This difference is stored in the variable `diff1`. The values of `i`, `i_next`, and `b[0]` remain unchanged, but `diff1` now holds the calculated difference.
