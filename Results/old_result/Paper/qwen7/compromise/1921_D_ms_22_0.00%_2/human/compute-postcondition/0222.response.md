Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, a new variable `max_heap` is created and contains one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into a max heap named `max_heap`. The values of `a`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states. A new variable `max_heap` is introduced, which now contains the specified tuple.
