Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the user will be prompted to enter two values separated by a space, and these values will be converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer within the range \(0 \leq t \leq 99\).
