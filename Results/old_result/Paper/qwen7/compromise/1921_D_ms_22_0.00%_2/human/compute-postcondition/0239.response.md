Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`, `tp1` is `1`, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` remains `0`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `0` to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
