Output State: **`i` is the first element of `a`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `i` (the first element of `a`) and the last element of `b` (`b[m-1]`). The values of `i` and `diff1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
