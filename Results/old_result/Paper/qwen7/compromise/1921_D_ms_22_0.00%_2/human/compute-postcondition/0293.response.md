Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will be empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each item popped from `max_heap`, the code updates `ans` by adding either the negative value of the first element of the popped item, the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`. Additionally, `tp1` will be incremented by 1 if `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, and `tp2` will be decremented by 1 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the greater of `diff1` and `diff2`.**

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain the total sum of the maximum differences between elements in list `a` and the nearest elements in list `b` (either `b[0]` or `b[m-1]`), considering the constraints on the indices `tp1` and `tp2`. The lists `a` and `b` will remain as they were after the last iteration, with `a` potentially being empty if all its elements were processed, and `b` remaining sorted. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` will be set to their final positions, which are `m` and `-1`, respectively, indicating that all elements have been considered relative to the start and end of the list `b`.
