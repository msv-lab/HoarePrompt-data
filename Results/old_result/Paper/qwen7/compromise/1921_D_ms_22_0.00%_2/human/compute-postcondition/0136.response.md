The loop condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. Given the description of the state right before the loop, we know that after all iterations, `max_heap` contains tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` based on certain conditions. However, this information pertains to the state after the loop has executed, not the initial state before the loop starts.

For the loop to execute the first time, `max_heap` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is non-empty at the start of the loop.

State: **`max_heap` is not empty**
