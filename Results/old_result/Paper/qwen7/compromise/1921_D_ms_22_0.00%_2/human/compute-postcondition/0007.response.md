Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the first input split by space, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the second input split by space sorted in ascending order.**

The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and the original list `b` remain unchanged, but now `b` is sorted.
