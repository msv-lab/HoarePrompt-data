Postcondition: `ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `ans` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
