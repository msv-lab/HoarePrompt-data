Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0] + 1, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`.**

Explanation: The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. Since `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, after the increment, `item[2]` will now be equal to `tp1 + 1`. All other conditions remain the same as the initial postconditions.
