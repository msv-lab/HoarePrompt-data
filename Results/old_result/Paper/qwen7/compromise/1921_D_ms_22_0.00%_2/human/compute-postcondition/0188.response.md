Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by -item[0], if `diff1` (the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged, so the state of `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and the alternative condition for `ans` are preserved.
