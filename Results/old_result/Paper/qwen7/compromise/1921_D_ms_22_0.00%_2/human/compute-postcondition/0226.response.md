Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. Therefore, `i` will take on each value in the list `a` sequentially.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`.
   - `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `a`, the next element in the list `a` will be the third element.
   - The list `a` must still have at least one element (as per the postcondition).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the third element of `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**
