Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`), or `-item[0]` (if `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2`). Additionally, if `item[2]` is exactly `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
