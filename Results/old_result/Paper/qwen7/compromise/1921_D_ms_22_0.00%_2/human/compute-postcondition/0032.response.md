Output State: **`i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the second last element of `b`, and `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto a max heap. The values of `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The new variable `max_heap` is created and contains the specified tuple.
