Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2 - 1]) + ans`, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`, `tp1` remains `0`, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + diff2`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The line `ans += diff2` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `diff2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `diff2` is updated to include the addition of `ans` to its original value.
