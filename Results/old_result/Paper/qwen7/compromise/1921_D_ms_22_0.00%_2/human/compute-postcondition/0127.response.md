Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is `i_next`
   - `b[0]` is unchanged
   - `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`
   - `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`
   - `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` or the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**: In the next iteration, `i` will take the next value from the list `a`. Since `i` was `i_next` in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be the element following `i_next` in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to the next value in the list `a`.
   - `b[0]` remains unchanged.
   - `diff1` and `diff2` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
   - The `max_heap` will be updated based on the new values of `diff1` and `diff2`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is the next value in the list `a` (let's call it `i_next_next`), `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i_next_next` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i_next_next` and `b[m - 1]`, `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-diff1, i_next_next, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` or the tuple `(-diff2, i_next_next, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.**
