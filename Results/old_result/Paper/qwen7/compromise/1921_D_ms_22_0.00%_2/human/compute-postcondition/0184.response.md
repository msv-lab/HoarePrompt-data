Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, if `diff1` is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
