Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the sizes of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Array `b`:**
   - The program sorts array `b` in ascending order.
   - This is a crucial step because we need to consider the closest and farthest values in `b` to maximize the differences.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A max heap is initialized to store tuples of the form `(-difference, value, index)` where `difference` is the absolute difference between the current element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`.
   - For each element in `a`, the program calculates the differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b` and pushes the larger difference into the heap.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to calculate the maximum total difference `D`.
   - It maintains two pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to track the current positions in `b` from the start and end.
   - For each element popped from the heap, it checks if the corresponding index in `b` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - If the index is out of range, it recalculates the differences using the nearest valid indices and updates the pointers accordingly.
   - If the index is within range, it adds the negative of the difference (since the heap stores negative differences) to the total difference `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, the program prints the total difference `ans`.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Sorting:** 
  - Sorting `b` ensures that we can efficiently find the closest and farthest values in `b` for each element in `a`.

- **Heap Usage:**
  - Using a max heap to store the differences allows us to always pick the maximum possible difference at each step, ensuring we maximize the total difference `D`.

- **Pointer Management:**
  - The use of pointers `tp1` and `tp2` correctly handles the scenario where the chosen indices from `b` might not be the immediate neighbors after some elements have been processed.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where the chosen indices from `b` are out of the current range `[tp1, tp2]` by recalculating the differences with the nearest valid indices.

### Conclusion:

The given program follows the logic required to solve the problem correctly. It efficiently uses sorting and a max heap to ensure that the maximum possible differences are considered for each element in `a`.

**Correctness: True**
