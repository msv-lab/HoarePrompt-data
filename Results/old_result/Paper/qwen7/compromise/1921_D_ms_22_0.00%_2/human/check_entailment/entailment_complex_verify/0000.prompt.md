You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

Specifically, for each item popped from `max_heap`, the code updates `ans` by adding either the negative value of the first element of the popped item, the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`. Additionally, `tp1` will be incremented by 1 if `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, and `tp2` will be decremented by 1 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the greater of `diff1` and `diff2`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two lists of integers \( a_i \) and \( b_i \). It sorts the list \( b \) and then calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of \( a_i \) and the closest elements in \( b \). Specifically, for each element in \( a_i \), it finds the closest element in \( b \) and adds the absolute difference to the total sum. The function returns the total sum of these differences for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the smallest and largest elements in `b` are not used optimally to maximize the total difference `D`.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4 6
1 2 3 4
8 7 5 8 2 10
```

Expected Output:
```
23
```

However, the program outputs `11`. The correct approach would be to pair each element in `a` with either the smallest or the largest element in `b` to maximize the differences. Here’s how the correct solution should work:

1. Sort both arrays `a` and `b`.
2. Pair the smallest element in `a` with the largest element in `b`, the second smallest element in `a` with the second largest element in `b`, and so on.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import math
    import heapq

    def func():
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
            a = list(map(int, input().split()))
            b = list(map(int, input().split()))

            # Sort both arrays
            a.sort()
            b.sort()

            ans = 0
            for i in range(n):
                # Calculate the maximum possible difference
                diff1 = abs(a[i] - b[m - 1 - i])
                diff2 = abs(a[i] - b[i])
                ans += max(diff1, diff2)

            print(ans)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the differences are maximized by pairing each element in `a` with the most different element in `b` available.
