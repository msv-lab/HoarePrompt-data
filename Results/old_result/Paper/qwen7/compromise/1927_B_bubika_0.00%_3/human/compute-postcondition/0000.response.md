Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, and `a` is reassigned to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.

Explanation: The code reassigns the variable `a` to the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This changes the value of `a` from a list of non-negative integers to a string. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
