Output State: **`t` is an input integer less than N, `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `r` is the string `a[x] + a[x] + a[x]`, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1 twice, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`**.

Explanation: The line `r += a[x]` adds the value of `a[x]` to the existing value of `r`. Given that `r` was initially set to `a[x] + a[x]`, adding `a[x]` to `r` results in `r` being updated to `a[x] + a[x] + a[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
