Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be less than N, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `r` is the string `a[x]`, `i` is the first element of the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` adds the value of `a[x]` to the string `r`. Here, `a[x]` refers to the element in the list `s` at the index `x`, which is the index of the first element `i` in the list `s`. Since `r` was initially an empty string, after executing the line of code, `r` becomes the string representation of `a[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
