Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop condition is `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)`. The variables involved are `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, all conditions in the loop head must be true:
   - `list[i] > 1`
   - `list[i - 1] > 0`
   - `list[i + 1] > 0`

3. **Check the Current State Before the Loop**: We don't have explicit values for `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` in the given state, but we know that these indices should satisfy the conditions for the loop to start.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `list[i]` must be greater than 1.
   - `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0.
   - `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0.

Since the current state doesn't provide specific values, we need to ensure that the conditions are met for the loop to start executing.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, and `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0**
