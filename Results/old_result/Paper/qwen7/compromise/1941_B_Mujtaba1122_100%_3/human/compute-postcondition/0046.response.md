Output State: **`list[i - 1]` is decreased by its own value, so `list[i - 1]` is now 0; `list[i]` is decreased by 2 times the original value of `list[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `list[i - 1]` from itself, making `list[i - 1]` equal to 0. The value of `list[i]` is not directly affected by this operation but is mentioned in the initial state as being decreased by 2 times the value of `list[i - 1]`, which is now 0. Therefore, the value of `list[i]` remains unchanged.
