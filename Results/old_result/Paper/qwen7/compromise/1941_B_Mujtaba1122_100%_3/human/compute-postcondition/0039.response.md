Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)`. The variables involved are `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`.

2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - All elements in the list except `list[i+2]` are now 0.
   - `list[i+2]` is now 0.

3. **Check each variable in the loop condition**:
   - For `list[i] > 1`: This means `list[i]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - For `list[i - 1] > 0`: This means `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - For `list[i + 1] > 0`: This means `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since all elements in the list except `list[i+2]` are 0, `list[i]` and `list[i - 1]` must be 0 unless they are explicitly set otherwise.
   - Therefore, to satisfy the condition `list[i] > 1`, `list[i]` must be set to a value greater than 1.
   - Similarly, to satisfy the condition `list[i - 1] > 0`, `list[i - 1]` must be set to a value greater than 0.
   - `list[i + 1]` can be 0 or any positive value as long as it is greater than 0, but since no specific value is mentioned, we assume it should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are `list[i]` and `list[i - 1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **All elements in the list except `list[i+2]` are now 0, and `list[i+2]` is now 0, `list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0**
