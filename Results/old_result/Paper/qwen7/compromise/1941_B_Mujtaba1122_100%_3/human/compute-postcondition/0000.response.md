Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Determine Initial Values for `i` and `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` must be initialized to 1.
   - `n` must be within the range specified (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is 1 because the loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5**.
