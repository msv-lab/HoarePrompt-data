Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It processes the list by repeatedly modifying its elements based on specific conditions. After processing, the list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that the last non-zero element (either `list[0]` or `list[n-1]`) will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value. The function prints 'YES' if `func_1(list, n)` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
