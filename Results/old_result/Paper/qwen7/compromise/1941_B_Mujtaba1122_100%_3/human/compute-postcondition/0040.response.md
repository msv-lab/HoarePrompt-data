Output State: **All elements in the list except `list[i+2]` are now 0, and `list[i+2]` is now 0, `list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` is now `list[i - 1] - list[i - 1]` which is 0.**

Explanation: The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`. Since `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` will become 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
