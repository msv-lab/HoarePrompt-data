Output State: **`list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0; `list[i]` is decreased by 2 times `list[i - 1]`; `list[i + 1]` is decreased by `list[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `list[i]` by subtracting twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. It also ensures that `list[i + 1]` is decreased by the value of `list[i - 1]`. The condition that `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
