Based on the initial state provided, the list `list` has been modified such that all elements except `list[i+2]` are set to 0. Additionally, `list[i+2]` is also set to 0, and `list[i]`, `list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1]` are all set to 0. It is also mentioned that `list[i-1]` is not equal to 0.

The `print('no')` statement simply prints the string 'no' without any reference to the modified list elements.

Output: **no**
