Output State: All elements in the list except `list[i+2]` are now 0, and `list[i+2]` is now 0, `list[i]` is now 0, `list[i - 1]` is now 0, `list[i + 1]` is now 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the conditions in the loop head (`list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0`) will no longer be met because `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` have all been reduced to 0. Therefore, the loop terminates, and all the specified elements in the list are now 0.
