Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by performing a specific operation any number of times.
2. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and decrementing the elements at indices \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
3. Function `func_2` attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array and applying the operation whenever possible until no further operations can be performed.
4. The key logic in `func_2` is the while loop which checks if the current element \(list[i]\) is greater than 1 and its adjacent elements are also greater than 0. If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operation.
5. After processing the array, the function uses `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
6. The `func_1` function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero, which is essential for determining the final outcome.
7. The provided examples and the execution summary of `func_2` confirm that the function behaves as expected, correctly identifying when it's possible to make all elements zero and when it's not.

Given this analysis, the implementation of both functions appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
