You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array elements, and n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`, and the function has not returned False during any iteration. This implies that for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `list[j]` is 0. If any `list[j]` was not 0 at any point, the function would have returned False earlier. Therefore, the final output state is that the entire list consists of zeros.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list 'list' are 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and an integer representing the number of elements in the list. It checks whether all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns False immediately. If the loop completes without finding any non-zero elements, it returns True, indicating that all elements in the list are zero.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: The list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that `list[n-1]` will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value, and all other elements will be 0. This is because the loop continuously modifies the elements as per the given conditions, eventually leaving only the first element (or the last one if we consider the reverse operation) with a negative value if it started with a non-zero value, and all others as zero.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop starts by checking if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
    #- If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations: subtracting `2 * list[i-1]` from `list[i]`, subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, and subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i-1]`.
    #- These operations continue until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1 or `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` is no longer greater than 0.
    #- After all iterations, the list will consist of zeros except for the last non-zero element (which could be `list[0]` or `list[n-1]` depending on the initial conditions), which will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that the last non-zero element (either `list[0]` or `list[n-1]`) will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value, and all other elements will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It processes the list by repeatedly modifying its elements based on specific conditions. After processing, the list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that the last non-zero element (either `list[0]` or `list[n-1]`) will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value. The function prints 'YES' if `func_1(list, n)` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where the array cannot be made entirely zero. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```

The program should output "NO" because it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operations. However, the current implementation does not check all necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero. The function `func_2` only checks if the element at index `i-1` is zero after the operations but does not ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zero. This can be seen in the example above, where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros due to the imbalance in the operations applied.
