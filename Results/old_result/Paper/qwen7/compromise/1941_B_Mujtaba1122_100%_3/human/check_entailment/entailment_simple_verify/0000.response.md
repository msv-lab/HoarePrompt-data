### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element.
- If it completes the loop without finding any non-zero elements, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
- It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
- For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
- If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations:
  - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
- If at any point `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the operations, it prints "NO" and returns immediately.
- After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if the entire list is zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
- The function `func_2` indeed checks if it's possible to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the specified operations.
- The loop ensures that the array is modified according to the rules, and the final check with `func_1` ensures that the array is completely zeroed out.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  5
  2 4 4 5 1
  ```
  - The function `func_2` will start by checking the first few indices.
  - For `i = 1`, `list[1] = 4`, `list[0] = 2`, and `list[2] = 4`. The conditions are met, so it performs the operations:
    - `list[2] -= 1 * 2` → `list[2] = 2`
    - `list[1] -= 2 * 2` → `list[1] = 0`
    - `list[0] -= 1 * 2` → `list[0] = 0`
  - The array now is `[0, 0, 2, 5, 1]`.
  - For `i = 2`, `list[2] = 2`, `list[1] = 0`, and `list[3] = 5`. The conditions are not met, so it moves to the next index.
  - For `i = 3`, `list[3] = 5`, `list[2] = 2`, and `list[4] = 1`. The conditions are met, so it performs the operations:
    - `list[4] -= 1 * 2` → `list[4] = -1`
    - `list[3] -= 2 * 2` → `list[3] = 1`
    - `list[2] -= 1 * 2` → `list[2] = 0`
  - The array now is `[0, 0, 0, 1, -1]`.
  - For `i = 4`, `list[4] = -1`, `list[3] = 1`, and `list[5]` does not exist. The conditions are not met, so it exits the loop.
  - Finally, `func_1` is called, which returns `False` because `list[3]` is not zero.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to check if it's possible to make all elements zero. The original assessment was incorrect because the program does handle the necessary conditions to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
