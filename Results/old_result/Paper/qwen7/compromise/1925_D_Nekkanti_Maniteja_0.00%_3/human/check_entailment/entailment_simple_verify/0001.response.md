### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several critical issues with the given program. Let's break down these issues and verify them using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\). This calculation is incorrect because \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) might not be an integer, and even if it is, the inverse should be calculated properly considering the context of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value**:
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correct for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and the effect of increasing the friendship value after each pick.

3. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculation**:
   - The modular multiplicative inverse should be calculated correctly using an appropriate method such as the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculation**:
   - The correct way to find the modular multiplicative inverse of a number `x` modulo `M` is to use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem. The given code uses `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` which is incorrect because it assumes \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) is an integer and directly takes the modular inverse. This is not always valid.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated differently. The problem involves random selection of pairs and the effect of increasing friendship values. The correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over `k` excursions.

3. **Formula Used**:
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly model the expected value. It seems to be an attempt to account for the number of excursions and the sum of initial friendship values but does not capture the probabilistic nature of the problem.

Given these issues, the original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect. The provided solution does not accurately model the problem and does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the modular multiplicative inverse calculation and the incorrect formula for the expected value.
