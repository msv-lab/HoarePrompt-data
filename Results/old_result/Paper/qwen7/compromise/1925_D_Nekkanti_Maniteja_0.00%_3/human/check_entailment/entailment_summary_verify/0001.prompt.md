You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers n, m, and k. It then reads m lines of input, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. The function calculates a value s based on the modular inverse of n*(n-1) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), the total sum of all f_i values, and the number of test cases and edges. Finally, it prints the result of s modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Constants and Variables Initialization**:
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used as the modulus.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is intended to be the reciprocal of the total number of unique pairs of children.
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of all initial friendship values.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program iterates through all `m` pairs of friends.
   - It reads the indices `u` and `v` of the pair and their friendship value `f`.
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Calculating the Expected Value**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).
   - It then enters a loop for `k` excursions.
   - In each excursion, it updates `s` using the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`. This seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected increase in friendship values.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\). However, this calculation is incorrect because \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) might not be an integer, and even if it is, the inverse should be calculated properly considering the context of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value**:
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correct for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and the effect of increasing the friendship value after each pick.

3. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculation**:
   - The modular multiplicative inverse should be calculated correctly using an appropriate method such as the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
