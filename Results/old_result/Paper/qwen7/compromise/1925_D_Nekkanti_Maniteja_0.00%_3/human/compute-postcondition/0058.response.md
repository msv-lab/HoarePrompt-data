Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` is `k + m`, `c` is `n * (n - 1) // 1`, `a` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `s`, `i`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged. The preconditions that `k` must be less than 0 and `m` must be greater than 0 are still valid.
