Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is \( s \) equals \( c \times \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \times c \times m + k \times c \times a \). Here, \( c \) is the modular inverse of \( n \times (n - 1) \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), \( a \) is the total sum of all integers \( f \) provided as input throughout the loop's execution, \( m \) is the number of edges, and \( k \) is the total number of operations performed within the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable \( s \) will hold the value calculated by the formula \( c \times \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \times c \times m + k \times c \times a \), where \( c \) is a specific constant derived from \( n \), \( a \) is the cumulative sum of all friendship values \( f \) across all inputs, \( m \) is the number of friendships, and \( k \) is the total number of operations executed inside the loop.
