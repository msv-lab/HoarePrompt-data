Output State: **`s` is `2 * c * (k + m - 1) * c * m + 2 * c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The initial state of `s` is given as `s + c * (k + m - 1) * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`. The code snippet adds `c * i * c * m + c * a` to `s`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the updated value of `i` is `i + 1`. The new value of `s` becomes the original value of `s` plus `c * i * c * m + c * a`, which simplifies to `c * (i + 1) * c * m + c * a`. Combining like terms, we get `2 * c * (k + m - 1) * c * m + 2 * c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`. The condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
