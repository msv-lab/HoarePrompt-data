Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. The initial state's condition that the input value must be greater than 0 is applied when the input is taken, but the output state only reflects the assignment of the input values to `n`, `m`, and `k`.
