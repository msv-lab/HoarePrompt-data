Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in this loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: When the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 because `range(int(input()))` generates numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 0 and will increment with each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).

For the loop to execute, the following adjustments are needed:
- `i` should be 0 initially.
- The value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, ensuring that there is at least one iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, and the input value must be greater than 0**.
