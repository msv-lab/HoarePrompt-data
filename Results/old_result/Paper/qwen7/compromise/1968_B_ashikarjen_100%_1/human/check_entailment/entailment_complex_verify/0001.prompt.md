You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

    0

Output

    2

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of all m values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    n, m = map(int, input().split())

    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:

        else:
            break
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `n`, `j` will be equal to `m`, and `k` will be the count of elements in `a` that have a matching element in `b` up to index `m-1`.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the count of elements in `a` that have a matching element in `b` up to index `m-1`)
    return
    #The program returns the count of elements in list 'a' that have a matching element in list 'b' up to index 'm-1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \). It counts and returns the number of characters in string \( a \) that have a matching character in string \( b \) up to index \( m-1 \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Strings**: For each test case, it correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, followed by the strings `a` and `b`.
3. **Initialization**: It initializes variables `k` and `j` to 0, where `k` will store the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will be used to iterate through `b`.
4. **Main Logic**:
   - It iterates through each character of `a` using a for loop.
   - Inside the loop, it uses a while loop to find the current character of `a` in `b`. If the character is found, it increments both `k` and `j` to move to the next character in `a` and the next character in `b`.
   - If the character is not found, it breaks out of the loop since no further characters in `a` can form a subsequence of `b` starting from the current position in `b`.
5. **Output**: After processing all characters of `a`, it prints the value of `k`.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic in the program correctly implements the required functionality. The program handles all edge cases and follows the specifications accurately.
