Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n is the first integer input split from input(), m is the second integer input split from input().**

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state. The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. Therefore, `n` and `m` are now specific integers within their respective ranges, while `t` retains its initial range constraint.
