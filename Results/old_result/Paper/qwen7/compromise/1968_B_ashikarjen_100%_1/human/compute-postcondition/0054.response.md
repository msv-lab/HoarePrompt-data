Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It returns the count of elements in string `a` that have a matching element in string `b` up to index `m-1` for each test case.**
