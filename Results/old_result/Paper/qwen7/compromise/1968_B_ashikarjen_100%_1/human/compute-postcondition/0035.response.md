Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until `i` is no longer within the bounds of `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1 for the first iteration, then by 3 for the next two iterations and by 1 for each subsequent iteration, `j + 2` is less than `m`, and `b[j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]`; `k` is incremented by 1 if the if condition is met.**
