Output State: `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until `i` is no longer within the bounds of `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 3, `j + 2` is less than `m`, and `b[j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have been incremented multiple times (once per iteration), `j` will have been incremented by 3 for each of the first 3 iterations and will continue to increment by 1 for each subsequent iteration, `n` will still be greater than or equal to 1, and the condition `b[j] != a[i]` will hold true for `j + 2` being the last checked index in `b`.
