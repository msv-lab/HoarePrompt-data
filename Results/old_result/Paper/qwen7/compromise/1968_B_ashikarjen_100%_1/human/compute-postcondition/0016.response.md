Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `k` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was previously the value it reached during the last iteration of the loop (either equal to `m` or the index where a matching element was found in `b`), now `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
