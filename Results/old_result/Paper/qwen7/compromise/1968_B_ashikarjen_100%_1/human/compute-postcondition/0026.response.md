Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is increased by 1.
   - `j` is less than `m - 1`.
   - `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]` must be true.
   - From the current states, we know:
     - `j` is increased by 1 (so `j` is now `j + 1`).
     - `j` is less than `m - 1` (so `j + 1` should be less than `m`).
     - `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - To ensure `j < m`, `j + 1` must be less than `m`.
   - To ensure `b[j] != a[i]`, `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `j + 1` is less than `m` and `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j + 1` must be less than `m`.
- `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, `j + 1` is less than `m`, and `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**
