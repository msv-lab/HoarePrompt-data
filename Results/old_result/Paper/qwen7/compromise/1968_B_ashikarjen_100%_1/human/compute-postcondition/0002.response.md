Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a string, `b` is the input result from the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
