Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is the value it reached during the last iteration of the loop (either equal to `m` or the index where a matching element was found in `b`), and `k` is incremented by 1.**

The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. Since `i` is already incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is the value it reached during the last iteration of the loop, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `k` is now incremented by 1.
