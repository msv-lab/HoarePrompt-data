You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. It constructs a new string `ans` based on specific comparison rules between `a` and `b`. After constructing `ans`, it prints the string. Additionally, it counts the number of consecutive positions where `a[j + 1]` matches `b[j]` and prints this count. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the length of the grid.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` for the top and bottom rows respectively.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It uses a boolean variable `work` to decide whether to take the current character from `a` or `b`.
   - The loop iterates through the characters of `a` and `b`:
     - If `work` is true, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
     - If appending the next character from `a` would make the path larger lexicographically compared to the next character from `b`, it switches to appending from `b` and sets `work` to false.
     - If no switch is needed, it continues appending from `a`.
   - If the end of `a` is reached, it appends the remaining characters from `b`.

3. **Counting Paths:**
   - After constructing the lexicographically smallest path, the program counts the number of such paths.
   - It initializes a counter `counter` to 1.
   - It iterates through the characters of `a` and `b`:
     - If the next character in `a` matches the current character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
     - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.

### Correctness Check

1. **Path Construction:**
   - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest path seems correct. It ensures that whenever possible, the path takes the smaller value between the current positions in `a` and `b`.

2. **Path Counting:**
   - The counting logic is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the next character in `a` matches the current character in `b` and resets the counter if `a` has a '0' and `b` has a '1'. This does not correctly count all paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

### Example Analysis

Consider the example provided:

- Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `a = "00"`, `b = "00"`
  - The lexicographically smallest path is `"000"`.
  - There are 2 paths: `[(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)]` and `[(1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)]`.

- Test Case 2: `n = 4`, `a = "1101"`, `b = "1100"`
  - The lexicographically smallest path is `"11000"`.
  - There is only 1 path: `[(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)]`.

- Test Case 3: `n = 8`, `a = "00100111"`, `b = "11101101"`
  - The lexicographically smallest path is `"001001101"`.
  - There are 4 paths: 
    - `[(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (2,7) -> (2,8)]`
    - `[(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (2,7) -> (2,8)]`
    - `[(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (2,7) -> (2,8)]`
    - `[(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (2,7) -> (2,8)]`

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest path but incorrectly counts the number of such paths. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
