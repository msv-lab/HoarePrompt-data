You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

    #State: The loop has executed for all iterations, producing an output string `ans` which is constructed based on the conditions inside the loop. The variable `counter` holds an integer value between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, representing the number of consecutive positions where `a[j + 1]` matches `b[j]` before encountering a mismatch or the end of the string `a`. The variable `i` is equal to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has processed all characters in `a`. The variable `work` is `False`, and `j` is `len(a) - 1`, signifying that the loop has checked each character in `a` up to the second last character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. It constructs a new string `ans` based on specific comparison rules between `a` and `b`. After constructing `ans`, it prints the string. Additionally, it counts the number of consecutive positions where `a[j + 1]` matches `b[j]` and prints this count. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the optimal path involves taking the minimum value between the current cell and the cell directly above it at each step. 

Consider the following test case:
```
3
2
10
01
```

The expected output should be:
```
00
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
10
1
```

This is because the program always prefers the value from the first row `a` over the second row `b`, which is not always the optimal choice. For instance, in the given test case, the lexicographically smallest string is `00` because we can take the value `0` from the second row at the second position, which is smaller than `1`. The program should compare the values from both rows and choose the minimum at each step to ensure the lexicographically smallest string is generated.
