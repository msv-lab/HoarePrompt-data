Postcondition: `counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `work` is set to `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. If `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, then `ans` is concatenated with `b[i]`. Otherwise, `i` is set to 2.
