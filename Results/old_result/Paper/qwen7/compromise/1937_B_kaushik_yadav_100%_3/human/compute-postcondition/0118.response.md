Postcondition: `counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` if `work` is `True` and `b[0]` if `work` is `False`, `work` is set to `False` if `b[i] < a[i + 1]` and `True` otherwise, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.
