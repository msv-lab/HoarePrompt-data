Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` contains the concatenation of characters from both `a` and `b`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` equals `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads an input string from the user and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. It does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `counter`, `ans`, `j`, `i`, `work`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `b` is updated to the input string with stripped whitespace.
