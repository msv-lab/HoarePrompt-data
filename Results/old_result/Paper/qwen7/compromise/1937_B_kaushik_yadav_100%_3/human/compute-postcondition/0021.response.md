Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is the first character of string `a`, `work` is set to True. If the character at index `i` in `b` is not less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `ans` is the character at index `i` in `b`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the first character of string `a`.
