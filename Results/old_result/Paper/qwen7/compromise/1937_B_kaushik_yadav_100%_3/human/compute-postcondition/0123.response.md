Output State: **`counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[i]` if `work` is `False` and `b[0]` followed by `a[i]` if `work` is `True`, `work` is set to `False` if `b[i] < a[i + 1]` and `True` otherwise when `work` is `True`, `i` must be 2 if `work` is `False` and `len(a) - 1` if `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0; `ans` is updated by adding `b[i]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The line `ans += b[i]` adds the character at index `i` of `b` to the end of `ans`. The value of `i` depends on whether `work` is `True` or `False`, and the value of `b[i]` is added accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
