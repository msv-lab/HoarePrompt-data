Output State: **`counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is set to `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads an input string, strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
