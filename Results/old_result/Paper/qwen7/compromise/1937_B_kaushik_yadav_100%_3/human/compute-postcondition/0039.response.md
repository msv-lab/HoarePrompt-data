Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` must have length greater than 1, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `b`, and `work` is set to `False`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ans` will be updated to contain the second character of `b` (since indexing starts at 0). However, since the exact value of `b` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact content of `ans` beyond knowing it now contains the first character of `b` (which is now the second character due to the increment of `i`). All other variables remain unchanged.
