Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `ans` is set to an empty string.
