Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` contains the concatenation of characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided, `i` equals `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, and `len(a)` must be at least 1. If the character at index `j + 1` in `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in `b`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1.
