Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of `a` plus `b[1]`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 2, `work` is `True`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` adds the character at index `i` of list `b` to the variable `ans`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `ans` is updated to be the first character of `a` plus `b[1]`. The other variables (`counter`, `j`, `work`) remain unchanged. Since `i` was incremented, its new value is 2.
