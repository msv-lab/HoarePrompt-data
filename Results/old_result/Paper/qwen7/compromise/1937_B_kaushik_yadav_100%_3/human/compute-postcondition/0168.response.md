Postcondition: `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3, `ans` contains the concatenation of characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` equals `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, and `len(a)` must be at least 1. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is 2 or 3. If `a[j + 1] != b[j]`, then `counter` remains 1 or 2, and if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, `counter` becomes 1; otherwise, `counter` remains 1 or 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
