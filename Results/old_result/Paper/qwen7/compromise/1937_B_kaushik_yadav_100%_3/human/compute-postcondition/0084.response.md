Postcondition: `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from either `a` or `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is set to `False` or `True` if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, `j` is 2, and the most internal loop or if statement has been exited. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, `counter` remains unchanged and `work` is determined based on the specified condition. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1 or 2 as per the initial condition.
