Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from either `a` or `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is set to `False`, `j` is 0, `len(a) - 1` is the upper limit of the loop, and the current value of `a[j + 1]` is equal to the current value of `b[j]`**.

Explanation: The line `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Since `counter` was initially 1, after executing this line, its new value is 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
