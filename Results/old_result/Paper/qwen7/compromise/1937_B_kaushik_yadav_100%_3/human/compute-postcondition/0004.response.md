Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
