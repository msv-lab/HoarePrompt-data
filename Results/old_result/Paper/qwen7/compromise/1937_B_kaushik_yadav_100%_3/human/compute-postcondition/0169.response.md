Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` contains the concatenation of characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` equals `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, and `len(a)` must be at least 1. If the character at index `j + 1` in `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in `b`, then `counter` is 2 or 3, and `ans` includes the corresponding character from `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `counter` remains either 1 or 2, and if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` becomes 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
