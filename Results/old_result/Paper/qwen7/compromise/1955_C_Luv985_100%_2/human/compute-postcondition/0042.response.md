Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

This means that the value of `k` is decreased by twice the value of `mi`, while both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each reduced by `mi`. The initial conditions that `k` must be greater than 0 and that `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` remain valid.
