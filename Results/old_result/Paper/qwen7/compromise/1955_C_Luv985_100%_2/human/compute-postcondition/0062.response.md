Output State: **`k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is less than `r`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

This means that `k` has been reduced by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the conditions that `l` is less than `r`, `a[l]` has been decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` has been decreased by `mi` remain unchanged.
