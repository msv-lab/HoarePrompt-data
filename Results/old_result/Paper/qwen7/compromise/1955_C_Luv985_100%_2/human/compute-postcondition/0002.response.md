State: **T must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4**

Explanation:
- The loop condition is `T`, and since the loop is `while T`, it will continue to execute as long as `T` is truthy (non-zero).
- Given that `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, it already satisfies the condition to enter the loop.
- No further adjustments are necessary because the loop will definitely execute at least once given the provided constraints.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains the same, but with the additional constraint that `T` must be a positive integer within the specified range.
