Output State: **`k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `l` is less than `r`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `k` is still decreased by `mi * 2`, `ans` is still increased by 1, and `a[l]` and `a[r]` are still decreased by `mi`. Additionally, since `l` was less than `r` initially, after incrementing `l` by 1, `l` is now equal to `l + 1`.
