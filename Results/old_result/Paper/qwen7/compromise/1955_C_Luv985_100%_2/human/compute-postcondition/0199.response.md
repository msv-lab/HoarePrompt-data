Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is either 2 or 1, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
