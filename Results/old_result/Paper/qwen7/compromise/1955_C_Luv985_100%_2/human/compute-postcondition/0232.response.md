Postcondition: `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` and `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k` and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `t` (where `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2), and `ans` remains unchanged. `a[l]` and `a[r]` are reduced by `mi` if the condition `mi * 2 <= k` is true.
