Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The values of `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `l`.
