Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

This means that the value of `k` has been decreased by `2 * mi`, while the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` have each been decreased by `mi`. The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid, but now it is `k > 0 - mi * 2`. The values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are also still reduced by `mi` respectively.
