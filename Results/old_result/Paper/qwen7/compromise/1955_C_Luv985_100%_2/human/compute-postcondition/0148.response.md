Postcondition: `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`; `ans` is incremented by 1 (so `ans` is now `ans + 1`), and `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0; otherwise, the values remain unchanged; `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r]` is 0; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.
