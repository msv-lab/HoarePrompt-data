Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is `k - 2 * min(a[0], a[n-1])`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, and the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
