Output State: **`n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `r` is `n - 1`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda; `l` is 0; `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `r`, `k`, `a`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
