Postcondition: **Output State: All elements in the list `a` will either be 0 or positive, `l` will be equal to `r`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, `ans` will count how many times elements were reduced to zero, and the loop will terminate as the conditions `l < r` and `k > 0` will no longer be satisfied.**
