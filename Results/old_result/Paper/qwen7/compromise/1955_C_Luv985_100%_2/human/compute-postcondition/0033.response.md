Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
