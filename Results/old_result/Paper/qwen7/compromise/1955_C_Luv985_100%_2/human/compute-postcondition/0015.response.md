Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the current value of `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. Since `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the precondition states that `mi` is less than or equal to half of `k`, the value of `a[l]` is updated accordingly. All other variables (`n`, `k`, and `mi`) remain unchanged.
