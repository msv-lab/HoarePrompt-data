Output State: **`k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `ans` is increased by 2, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
