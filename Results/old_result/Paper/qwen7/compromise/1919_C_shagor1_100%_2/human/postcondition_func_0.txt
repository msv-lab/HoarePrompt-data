The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). It verifies that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \) for each element in the list. If the conditions are met, it returns a result indicating that the test case is valid; otherwise, it indicates that the test case is invalid.
