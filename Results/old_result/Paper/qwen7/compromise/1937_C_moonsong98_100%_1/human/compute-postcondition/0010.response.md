Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - The state before the loop starts is given as follows:
     - `max_index` is the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, or remains 0 if no such character exists.
     - `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range `[0, n-1]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `max_index` and `min_indices` are not directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is within the range [0, n-1]**
