Output State: `max_index` is the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, 0, 0, i)`, or remains 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, 0, max_index, i)` returned '<'. If no such character exists, `min_indices` remains an empty list.
