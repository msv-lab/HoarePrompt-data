### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The key insight is that the maximum sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the sum of the entire array to itself up to `k` times.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum sum can be calculated as the sum of the array multiplied by the number of times the entire array sum can be added (`k // n`) plus the sum of the array multiplied by the remaining operations (`k % n`).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It seems to be a helper function for handling the result.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the segment with the maximum sum. However, the logic in this function is flawed. It does not correctly handle the merging of segments or the calculation of the maximum segment sum.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not seem to contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the sum of the array.
   - Determine the effective number of full array sums that can be added (`k // n`).
   - Add the sum of the array multiplied by the effective number of full sums.
   - If there are remaining operations (`k % n`), add the sum of the array again.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code shows that the program attempts to find the maximum segment sum using `func_2`, which is incorrect. The function `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum segment sum and instead returns a subarray with the highest starting index.
   - The main logic in the program is in the loop where it calculates the final answer using the sum of the array and the number of operations. However, since `func_2` is not correctly implemented, the program will not produce the correct result.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, `func_2` is not implemented correctly and `func_3` is missing.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The code provided does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_2` is flawed, and `func_3` is missing, leading to an incorrect implementation.
