Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum found, `segments_variants` is a list containing `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `[-1]` to `total_max_segment`. Since `total_max_segment` was previously defined as the subarray from `segments_variants` with the highest starting index, and now it is explicitly set to `[-1]`, all other variables remain unchanged.
