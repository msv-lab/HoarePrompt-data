Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum found, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays that have the maximum sum found during the iterations, `segments_variants` now contains `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `segments_variants` also contains `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.**

In this step, the code appends `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` to `segments_variants`. Since `new_segment` is an empty list, `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` simplifies to `[len(arr) - 1]`. Therefore, `segments_variants` now includes both `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `[len(arr) - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
