You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Example

Input

    7
    
    5 3
    
    4 1 1 4 4
    
    1 10
    
    7
    
    7 2
    
    4 2 1 100 5 2 3
    
    10 4
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 2
    
    3 8 1 48 7
    
    6 2
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40
    
    6 3
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40

Output

    2
    1
    1
    3
    5
    1
    6
    
Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers. It then determines whether the maximum frequency of any number in the list is at least \( k \). If so, it prints \( k - 1 \); otherwise, it prints \( n \). This process is repeated for each of the \( t \) test cases, where \( t \) is the first input integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It creates a list `p` where each element is the count of occurrences of a unique number in the list `l`.
   - This is done using a list comprehension that counts the occurrences of each unique number in `l`.

3. **Checking Condition and Printing Result:**
   - If the maximum value in `p` (i.e., the highest count of any unique number) is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Problem Description and Constraints:
- The goal is to minimize the number of cards in the hand by performing operations where you can exchange `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards.
- The key insight is that you can only reduce the number of cards if you have at least `k` identical cards.

### Correctness Check:
- **Condition for Reduction:** The condition `max(p) >= k` correctly identifies if there are enough identical cards to perform an operation.
- **Output Calculation:**
  - If `max(p) >= k`, reducing `k` identical cards to `k-1` is allowed, hence the result should be `k - 1`.
  - If `max(p) < k`, no operation can be performed, and the result should be `n`.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1:** `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`
  - Unique counts: `[1, 3, 2]`
  - Maximum count: `3` (which is `k`)
  - Output: `3 - 1 = 2` (Correct)
- **Example 2:** `1 10 7`
  - Unique counts: `[7]`
  - Maximum count: `7` (less than `10`)
  - Output: `1` (Correct)
- **Example 3:** `7 2 4 2 1 100 5 2 3`
  - Unique counts: `[1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Maximum count: `2` (which is `k`)
  - Output: `2 - 1 = 1` (Correct)
- **Example 4:** `10 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Unique counts: `[10]`
  - Maximum count: `10` (which is `k`)
  - Output: `10 - 1 = 9` (Incorrect, should be `4 - 1 = 3`)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where `max(p) == k` correctly. In such cases, the number of cards should be reduced by `k-1` instead of just `k-1`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
