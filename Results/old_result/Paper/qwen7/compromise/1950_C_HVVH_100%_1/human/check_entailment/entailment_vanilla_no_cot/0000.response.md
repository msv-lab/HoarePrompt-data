Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` but does not use it in the loop. Instead, it should read each test case within the loop.
2. **Handling Midnight**: The logic for handling midnight (`00:00`) is incorrect. It should correctly output `12:00 AM` instead of `12:00`.
3. **Handling Noon**: The logic for handling noon (`12:00`) is also incorrect. It should correctly output `12:00 PM` instead of just setting `day` to `PM`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the time is correctly converted to 12-hour format and handles both midnight and noon appropriately.
