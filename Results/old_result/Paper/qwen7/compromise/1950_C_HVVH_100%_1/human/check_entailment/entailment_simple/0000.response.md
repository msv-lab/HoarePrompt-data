Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, splitting the input string `s` into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
3. The logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format is as follows:
   - If `h` is 0, it converts to 12 AM.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 and sets `day` to PM.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to AM, and if `h` is 12, it sets `day` to PM.
4. The formatted output is printed in the required format.
5. The state after the loop matches the expected output, with `t` remaining unchanged and `day` set based on the last conversion.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format and outputs the results in the specified format.

Correctness: **True**
