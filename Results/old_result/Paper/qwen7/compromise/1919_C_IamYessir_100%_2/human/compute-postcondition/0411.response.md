Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is not infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[0]`, the current value of `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[0]`, and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is greater than `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 0, `b` now contains `lit[0]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
