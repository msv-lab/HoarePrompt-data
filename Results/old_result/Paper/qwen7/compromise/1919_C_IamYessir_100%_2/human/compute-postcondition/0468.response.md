Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If the list `b` is empty, then `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity. If the list `a` is empty, then `x` is infinity and `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If both lists `a` and `b` are non-empty, then `x` is the last element of the list `a` and `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `lit[3]` is greater than `x`, then `x` becomes `lit[3]` and `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
