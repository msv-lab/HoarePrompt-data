Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity, or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `a` is updated to include the element `lit[i]` with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is updated to the maximum of the current `y` and `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then `a` and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `x` is infinity or the last element of list `a` and `y` is greater than or equal to `a[1]` and `a[1]` is greater than `x`, then list `b` has an additional element which is the same as `a[1]`. Additionally, if `x` is infinity or the last element of list `a` and `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `a[3]` and `b` becomes a list with its last element being `a[3]`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then `b` has an additional element which is `a[3]` if `y` is greater than or equal to `a[3]`, otherwise `a` is a list with its last element being `a[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
