Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `a[3]` and `b` becomes a list with its last element being `a[3]`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then `b` has an additional element which is `a[3]` if `y` is greater than or equal to `a[3]`, otherwise `a` is a list with its last element being `a[3]`.
