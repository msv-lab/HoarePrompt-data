Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity, or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`, and list `b` now contains the element `lit[0]` added to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 0, the first element of `lit` (denoted as `lit[0]`) is appended to `b`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
