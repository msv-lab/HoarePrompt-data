Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; `a` is a list with at least one element, and now has one more element which is `a[-1]` (the new element is `a[i]`); `x` is the last element of list `a`; `y` is the last element of list `a` or infinity if `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is `1`) to the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, the element being appended is `a[1]`. The value of `x` and `y` remains unchanged unless `b` is an empty list, in which case `y` would be set to infinity.
