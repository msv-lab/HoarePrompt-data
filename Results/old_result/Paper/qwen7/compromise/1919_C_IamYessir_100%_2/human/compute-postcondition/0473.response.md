Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[3]`, `x` is infinity, `y` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` (where `i` is 3) to the list `b`. Since `b` was initially empty, it now contains the single element `lit[3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
