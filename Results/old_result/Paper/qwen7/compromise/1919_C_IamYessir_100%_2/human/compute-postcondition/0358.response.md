Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; the last element of list `a` is assigned to `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that the length of `a` is not 0 is still valid, as the assignment only happens if `a` has elements.
