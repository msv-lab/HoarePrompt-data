Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(b)` + 1, `b` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `x` is not infinity, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`. `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i`, and if `x` is less than the first element of list `b` (`lit[0]`), then `lit[0]` is either an element of list `a` or greater than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is greater than `x`. If `x` is not less than `lit[0]`, then `a` contains the element `lit[0]` appended to its previous contents.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index 1, and `a` is a list that either has its last element updated to `lit[1]` or appended with `lit[1]` depending on whether `x >= lit[1]` or `lit[1] > y` respectively. The conditions involving `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` remain the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If the list `b` is empty, then `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity. If `lit[3]` is greater than `x`, then `x` becomes `lit[3]` and `y` remains unchanged. If `lit[3]` is greater than `y` and `y` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to `lit[3]` and `y` remains infinity. If the list `a` is empty, `x` is infinity and `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If both lists `a` and `b` are non-empty, then `x` is the last element of the list `a` and `y` is the last element of the list `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
