Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `x` is greater than or equal to `a[3]`, then `y` remains unchanged and `b` is a list with its last element being `a[3]`. If `a[3]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `a[3]` and `b` is a list with its last element being `a[3]`.
