Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 2`, and `s` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its original state. The variable `i` is updated to `k + 2` because it was originally `k + 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
