Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. Additionally, if `x` is infinity or the last element of list `a` and `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` (which is `lit[1]`) of list `a` and the element at index `i-1` of list `a` is greater than `x`, then list `b` has an additional element which is the same as the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.
