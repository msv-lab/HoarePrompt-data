Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index 1, and `a` is a list that either has its last element updated to `lit[1]` or appended with `lit[1]` depending on whether `x >= lit[1]` or `lit[1] > y` respectively. The conditions involving `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` remain the same.
