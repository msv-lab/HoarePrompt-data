Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. However, since the initial state does not specify the contents of the list `a`, `x` is simply described as the last element of `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
