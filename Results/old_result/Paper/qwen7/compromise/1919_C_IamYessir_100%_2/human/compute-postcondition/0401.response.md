Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `x` is not infinity; `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`; `b` is not an empty list; the first element of list `a` is equal to `lit[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 0, the first element of `lit` (which is `lit[0]`) is appended to `a`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
