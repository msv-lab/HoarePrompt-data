Output State: **`i` is `initial_i + 2`, `n` remains as it was initially, `s` is `s + 1`**

The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Since `i` and `n` were not affected by this operation, their values remain as they were initially. Therefore, `i` is still `initial_i + 2`, `n` remains as it was initially, and `s` is now `s + 1`.
