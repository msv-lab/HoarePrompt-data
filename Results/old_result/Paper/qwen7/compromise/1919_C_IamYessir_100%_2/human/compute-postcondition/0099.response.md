Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to the second element of list `a` and the second element of list `a` is greater than `x`, then `y` is updated to the element at index 1 of list `a`. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
