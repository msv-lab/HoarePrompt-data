Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If the list `b` is empty, then `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity. If `lit[3]` is greater than `y` and `y` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to `lit[3]` and `y` remains infinity. If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity and `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If both lists `a` and `b` are non-empty, then `x` is the last element of the list `a` and `y` is the last element of the list `b`.
