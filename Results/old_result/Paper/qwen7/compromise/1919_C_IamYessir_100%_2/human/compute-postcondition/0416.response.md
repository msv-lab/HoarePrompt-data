Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is not infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[0]`, and `x` is less than `lit[0]`. If `lit[0]` is greater than `y`, then `lit[0]` is an element of list `a`; otherwise, `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `y` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is greater than `x`.
