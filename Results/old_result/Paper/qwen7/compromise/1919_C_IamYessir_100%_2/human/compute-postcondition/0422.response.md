Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `x` is not infinity, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`. `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i`, and if `x` is less than the first element of list `b` (`lit[0]`), then `lit[0]` is either an element of list `a` or greater than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is greater than `x`. If `x` is not less than `lit[0]`, then `a` contains the element `lit[0]` appended to its previous contents.
