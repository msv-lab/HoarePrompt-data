Output State: **`i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list containing the element `lit[3]`; `b` is either empty or not empty, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[3]`), and `y` is either infinity or the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[3]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 3, the list `a` now contains one element, which is `lit[3]`. The values of `n`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain as per their conditions before the code was executed. Specifically, if `b` is empty, `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity; otherwise, if `a` is empty, `x` is infinity and `y` is the last element of `b`; and if both lists are non-empty, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[3]`) and `y` is the last element of `b`.
