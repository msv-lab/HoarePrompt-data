Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `lit[i] > x`. If `i` is 2, then `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and now has one more element (`a[i]`), `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `y` is the last element of list `a` if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, otherwise `y` remains the same as its original value or infinity if `b` is an empty list. If `i` is 1, then `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and now has one more element (`a[i]`), `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `y` is the last element of list `a`.
