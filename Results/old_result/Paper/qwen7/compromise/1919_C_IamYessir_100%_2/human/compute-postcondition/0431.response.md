Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 2), and the conditions involving `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` remain the same.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 2. The value of `b` now includes the element from `lit` at index 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
