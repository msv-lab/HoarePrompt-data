Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[0]`, `x` is not infinity, `y` is equal to `lit[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` (which is `lit[0]` given the initial state) to the list `b`. Since `i` is 0 initially, `b` now contains `[lit[0]]`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial conditions unless specified otherwise by the code, which they are not in this case. Therefore, `x` is not infinity, and `y` is equal to `lit[0]`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
