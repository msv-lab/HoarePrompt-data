Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity, or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`, and list `b` now contains the value of `lit[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, `lit[i]` refers to the first element of the list `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
