Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, and now has one more element which is `a[-1]` (the new element is `a[i]`); `x` is the last element of list `a`; `y` is the last element of list `a` if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, otherwise `y` remains the same as its original value or infinity if `b` is an empty list.
