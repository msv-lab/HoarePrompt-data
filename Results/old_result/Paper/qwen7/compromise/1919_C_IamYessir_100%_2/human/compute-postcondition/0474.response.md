Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `lit[3]` (which is `y`) is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` remains infinity and `y` remains infinity. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states where `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity.
