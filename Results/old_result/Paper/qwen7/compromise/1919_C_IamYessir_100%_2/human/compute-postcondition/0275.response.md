Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list with one additional element which is `a[i]` (i.e., the second element of list `a`).**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after the operation, `i` becomes 2 (as list indices start from 0). The value of `n`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. List `b` now contains one additional element, which is the second element of list `a`.
