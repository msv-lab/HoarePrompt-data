Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(b)`, `b` is a list with at least one element, and `s` is the count of elements in list `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of list `b`. The variable `b` will still be the same list it started as, but with at least one element. The variable `s` will hold the count of elements in list `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element, which is the result of executing the loop's condition `if b[i] > b[i - 1]: s += 1` for every valid index `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
