Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 1)**.

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. Since `i` was 1, `b` remains unchanged as it only contains the element from list `b` at index `i`. The values of `n`, `y`, and the condition involving `b` and `lit` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
