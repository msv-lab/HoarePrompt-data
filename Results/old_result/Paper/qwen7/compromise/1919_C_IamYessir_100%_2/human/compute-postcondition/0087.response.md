Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`; `b` is a list with its last element being `a[i-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (since list indices start from 0), making `i` equal to 2. The list `b` now contains the last element of `a` (which is `a[1]` since `i` was 1 before the increment). All other conditions remain unchanged.
