Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`.
