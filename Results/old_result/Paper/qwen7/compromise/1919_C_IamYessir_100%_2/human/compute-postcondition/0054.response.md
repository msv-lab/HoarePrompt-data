Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list with its last element equal to `lit[0]`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` (which is `lit[0]` since `i` is 0) to the list `a`. This changes the list `a` to include its previous elements plus the new value `lit[0]`. The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of the updated list `a`, which is now `lit[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
