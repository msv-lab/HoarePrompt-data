Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index 1, `a` is a list that now contains the element `lit[1]`, and if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, then `i` is set to 2.
