Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `b` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is not an empty list, `y` is the last element of list `a`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `a` now contains the element `lit[0]` appended to its previous contents.
