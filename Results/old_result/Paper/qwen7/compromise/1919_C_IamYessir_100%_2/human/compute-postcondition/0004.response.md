Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cp = 0` initializes the variable `cp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
