Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the element `lit[i]` with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`. List `b` contains the value of `lit[i]` appended to it if `lit[i] > x`, otherwise `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` while `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`.
