Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is set to infinity. If `i` is 1 and `lit[i] > y`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `i` is 2, `y` is set to `lit[i]` if `b` is a list with one additional element which is `a[i]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.
