Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` will also remain unchanged from its initial value. The lists `a` and `b` will contain elements based on the logic within the loop. Specifically, elements from the list `lit` will be distributed between `a` and `b` according to the conditions provided:

- If `x` (the last element of `a`) is greater than `y` (the last element of `b`), elements from `lit` will be added to `b` if they meet certain conditions (greater than or equal to `y` but less than `x`).
- If `x` is not greater than `y`, elements from `lit` will be added to `a` if they meet certain conditions (less than or equal to `x` but greater than `y`).
- If `x` equals `y`, elements from `lit` will be added to `a`.
- If `x` is infinity, it means `a` was initially empty, and elements from `lit` will be added to `a` unless they are greater than `y`.

The final states of `a` and `b` will reflect the distribution of elements from `lit` based on these rules. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last elements of `a` and `b`, respectively, or infinity if their respective lists are empty.
