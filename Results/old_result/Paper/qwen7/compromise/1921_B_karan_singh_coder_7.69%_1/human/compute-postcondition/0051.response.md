Output State: **`i` is 1, `cnt` is 2 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Initially, `i` is 1 and `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0. Since the code increments `cnt` only when `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, and `i` is 1 here, `cnt` will be incremented by 1 only if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`. Therefore, `cnt` will be 2 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, and 1 otherwise. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
