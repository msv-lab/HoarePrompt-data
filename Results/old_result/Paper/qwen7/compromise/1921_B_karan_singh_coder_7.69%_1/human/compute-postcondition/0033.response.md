Output State: `cnt` is 6, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `s` is updated to the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string, `i` is 4.

Explanation: The loop runs `n` times, and based on the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce that the total difference between corresponding characters in strings `s` and `t` is 6. Since the loop increments `cnt` by 1 each time it finds a differing character (as per the condition `cnt += s[i] != t[i]`), and it has already executed 3 times with `cnt` being 4, it will execute 2 more times (from `i=3` to `i=4`), adding 2 more to `cnt`. Therefore, after all iterations, `cnt` will be 6. The values of `s1`, `t1`, `s`, `t`, and `i` will depend on the final input strings and the value of `n`, but they will be updated accordingly as per the loop's execution.
