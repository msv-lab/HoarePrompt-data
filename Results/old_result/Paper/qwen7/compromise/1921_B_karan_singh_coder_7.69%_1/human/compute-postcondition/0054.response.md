Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`), the variable `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` do not match. This count is incremented each time the condition `s[i] != t[i]` is true during the loop's execution.
