Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`. If `s1` equals `t1`, `cnt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated based on the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `cnt`, `s1`, `t1`, or the strings `s` and `t`. Therefore, the initial conditions remain valid, and only `n` is updated to be an input integer.
