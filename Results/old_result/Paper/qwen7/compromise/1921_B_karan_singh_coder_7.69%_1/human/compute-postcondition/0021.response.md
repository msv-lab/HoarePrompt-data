Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`, `t1` remains the number of '1' characters in the string `s`, `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`cnt`, `t1`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
