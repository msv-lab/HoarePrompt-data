Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python when you don't care about the value of the iterator. It is typically used for iterating over a sequence without needing to access the elements.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. Since the input is expected to be a positive integer (as per the problem statement), the loop will always execute as long as the input is valid and within the specified range.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the input provided. The key here is to ensure that the input is a valid positive integer within the specified range.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop will iterate based on the number of test cases provided by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this input is a valid positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, ensuring it is a valid positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the input must be a valid positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
