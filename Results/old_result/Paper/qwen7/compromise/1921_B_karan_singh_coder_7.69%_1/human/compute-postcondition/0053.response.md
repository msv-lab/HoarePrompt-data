Output State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is 3 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, otherwise `cnt` is 2**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the condition checks `s[2] != t[2]`. Since the initial value of `cnt` is 2 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, and it remains 1 otherwise, the increment operation will make `cnt` equal to 3 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, or remain 2 if `s[1]` is equal to `t[1]`. The value of `n` being greater than 2 is still a valid precondition.
