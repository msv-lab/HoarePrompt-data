Output State: **`cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string, `i` is 4, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '1' characters in strings `s` and `t` and assigns it to the variable `d`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
