Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, and the initial and final states of the boxes as strings `s` and `t`.
3. It calculates the count of '1's in both `s` and `t` (i.e., the number of boxes initially and finally occupied by cats).
4. It then calculates the total number of differing positions (`cnt`) between the initial and final states.
5. The logic to compute the minimum number of operations is correct:
   - If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` are the same (`s1 == t1`), the minimum number of operations is the number of differing positions (`cnt`) if any, otherwise, it is `0`.
   - If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` are different, the minimum number of operations is calculated as `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program logic matches the requirements and produces the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
