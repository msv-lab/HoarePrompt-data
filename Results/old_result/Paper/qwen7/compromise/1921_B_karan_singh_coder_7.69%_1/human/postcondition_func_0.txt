The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and two binary strings of length \( n \). It calculates the number of differing positions between the initial and final states of the boxes represented by these strings. Based on the counts of '1's in both strings and the number of differing positions, the function outputs either the count of '1's in the final state or a specific computed value derived from the counts and differing positions.
