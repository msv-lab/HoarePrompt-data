You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: All elements in `D` are set to zero, `C` is empty, `E` contains all unique elements from `aa[:n-m]` that were present in any of the `nabors` iterations, `fnd` is the total number of times the loop executed where `sum(D.values())` was greater than or equal to `k`, `tot` is zero, and `nabors` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop executed.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, since the loop continuously modifies `D` by decrementing its values and adjusts `C` and `E` based on certain conditions, eventually all values in `D` will be decremented to zero. The variable `fnd` keeps track of the number of times the condition `tot >= k` is met and increments accordingly. The counter `C` will reflect how many times each key's count in `D` matched exactly with its count in `cnt_aa`, and `E` will contain all unique elements from `aa[:n-m]` that were not in `D` after all iterations. The state of `bb`, `cnt_aa`, and `cnt_bb` remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. `tot` will be zero because once `D` is empty, no further changes can occur to `tot` which is the sum of `D.values()`. The variable `nabors` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop executed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of good subsegments of array `a` based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes counters for the elements in the first `m` elements of `a` (`cnt_aa`) and the elements in `b` (`cnt_bb`).

2. **Initial Check**: It calculates the initial overlap between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` (`D`), which represents the number of elements in the first `m` elements of `a` that also appear in `b`.

3. **Sliding Window**: The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of length `m` in `a`. For each new element entering the window and each element leaving the window, it updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly:
   - `D` tracks the common elements between the current window and `b`.
   - `E` tracks the elements in the current window that are not in `b`.
   - `C` tracks the elements in `b` that are not in the current window.

4. **Counting Good Subsegments**: The program keeps track of the total number of common elements (`tot`) and increments the count of good subsegments (`fnd`) whenever `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the first `m` elements of `a` might already contain enough elements from `b` to satisfy the condition `k`.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it correctly implements the required functionality without any apparent flaws. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case described in the problem statement.
