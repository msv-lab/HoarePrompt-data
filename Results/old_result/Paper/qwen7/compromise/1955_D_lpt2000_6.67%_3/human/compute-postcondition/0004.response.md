Output State: **`nabors` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `bb`. The other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `aa`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
