Postcondition: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 2. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains the same. `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`. `aa` must have at least `n` elements. `m` is an integer. `n` is an integer. `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least 1 element. `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged in both cases.**
