Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(nabors)`. The only variable here is `nabors`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `nabors`**: According to the given information, `nabors` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq nabors \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `nabors` is greater than 0. Since `nabors` is an input integer and we know its range, we need to ensure that `nabors` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to adjust the state of `nabors` to ensure the loop can execute. Given the range \(1 \leq nabors \leq 10^4\), the minimum value `nabors` can take is 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `nabors` being at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nabors` must be at least 1**
