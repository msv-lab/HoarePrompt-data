Postcondition: **`aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least 1 element. `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 again, `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and either `E[out_aa]` was originally greater than 0 but is now less than its original value, or `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, so `D[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1`, and `C[in_aa]` is not equal to `D[in_aa]`.**
