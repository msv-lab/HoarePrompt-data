Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, and `C[in_aa]` is not equal to `D[in_aa]`.**

Explanation: The code `D[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `D[in_aa]` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
