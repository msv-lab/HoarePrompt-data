Output State: **`nabors` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in `aa` up to index `m-1`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`.**

Explanation: The code `C = cnt_bb - D` creates a new Counter object `C` which represents the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`. This means that `C` contains the elements that are in `cnt_bb` but not in `D`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
