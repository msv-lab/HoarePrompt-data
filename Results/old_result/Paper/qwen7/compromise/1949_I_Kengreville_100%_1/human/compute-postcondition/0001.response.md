Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n`, `r` is a list of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to False, and `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None.**

Explanation: The code `x = [None] * n` initializes the list `x` to a list of length `n` where each element is `None`. The other variables (`y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
