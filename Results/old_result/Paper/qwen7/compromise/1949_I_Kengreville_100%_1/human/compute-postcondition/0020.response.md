Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 1000), x (a list of integers), y (a list of integers), r (a list of integers), visited (a list of boolean values), and coef (a list). The function does not return any value.**

This means the function `func_1` takes several parameters including an integer `n`, two lists of integers `x` and `y` of length `n`, a list of integers `r` of length `n`, a list of boolean values `visited` also of length `n` initialized to `False`, and a list `coef` of length `n` initialized to `None`. The function does not return any value based on the given output cases.
