Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair during the excursions. Instead, it incorrectly calculates the sum based on a constant factor and the number of excursions, which does not reflect the actual expected value.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of selecting each pair of friends and how their friendship values change over the excursions. The program should calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each pair and then sum these expected values for all k excursions.
