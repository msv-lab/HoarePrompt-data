Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct because it represents the total number of unique pairs of children, and its inverse is needed for the expected value calculation.
3. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all friendship values `f_i` from the input. This is also correct.
4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expression `k * c * (k-1) * c * m + k * c * a` is used to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. This formula is derived from the problem statement, where the expected value of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion is correctly accounted for.
5. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to follow the correct logic and formula as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
