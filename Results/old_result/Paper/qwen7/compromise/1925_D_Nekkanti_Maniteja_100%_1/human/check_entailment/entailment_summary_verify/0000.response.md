### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Each pair of friends' friendship value increases by 1 for every excursion they are chosen.
- The friendship value of non-friend pairs remains 0.

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Calculation of \( c \)**:
   - \( c \) is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) modulo \( M \).
   - This value is used in the calculation but its purpose is unclear without further context.

2. **Summation of Friendship Values**:
   - \( a \) is initialized to 0 and incremented by the friendship values \( f_i \) for each pair of friends.
   - The term \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m \) suggests a linear increase in the sum, which is incorrect.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The term \( c \cdot a \) is added in each iteration, which again does not reflect the expected value calculation.

#### Correct Approach:
- For each pair of friends, the expected number of times they will be chosen in \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- The expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- The total expected value is the sum of the expected increases for all pairs of friends.

Given the function summary, the program seems to be attempting to use the modular inverse \( c \) and the sum of friendship values \( a \), but the way it combines these elements is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The current implementation does not account for the probability of choosing each pair during the excursions, leading to an incorrect result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
