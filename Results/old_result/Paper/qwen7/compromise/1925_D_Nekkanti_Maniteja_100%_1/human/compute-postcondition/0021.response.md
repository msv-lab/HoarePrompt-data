Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `m`
   - `k` is equal to `m`
   - `s` is `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m` and `k` is `m`.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`.
   - Since `i` is currently `m` and `k` is also `m`, `i` is not less than `k`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop will not execute again because `i` is already equal to `k`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, no changes are needed for `i` or `k`.
   - The value of `s` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case does not occur) remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`**
