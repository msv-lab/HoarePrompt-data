Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `k`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `k`**:
   - The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - The variable `k` represents the total number of iterations the loop will run, which is determined by the value of `m`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will run `k` times, incrementing `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` should be set to `m` (the total number of iterations) at the start of the loop.
   - `k` should be set to `m` because the loop will run `m` times.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` are inputs read from the user during each iteration. These variables are not part of the loop head and their initial states do not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - The variable `a` will accumulate the sum of all `f` values, but this accumulation happens inside the loop body and is not relevant to the initial state before the loop.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `m`, `k` must be equal to `m`**
