Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k, and a list of m tuples (a_i, b_i, f_i). The function returns information based on the given constraints and the processed data.**

This means the function handles multiple test cases where each case involves processing values for `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with a list of `m` tuples representing friendships and associated values `f_i`. The function ensures that all constraints are met and processes the data accordingly, though the specific output details are not provided in the given information.
