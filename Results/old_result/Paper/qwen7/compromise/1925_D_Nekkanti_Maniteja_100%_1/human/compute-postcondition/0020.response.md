Output State: **`i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `i` is `m` and `k` is equal to `m`, the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` remains unchanged. Therefore, `s` is now twice the original value of `c * i * c * m + c * a`. The values of `i` and `k` remain the same.
