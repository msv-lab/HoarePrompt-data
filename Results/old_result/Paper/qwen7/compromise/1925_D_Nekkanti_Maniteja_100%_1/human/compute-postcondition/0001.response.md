Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers separated by spaces from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `i` remains unchanged with its initial value of 0, and `t` is unaffected by this operation.
