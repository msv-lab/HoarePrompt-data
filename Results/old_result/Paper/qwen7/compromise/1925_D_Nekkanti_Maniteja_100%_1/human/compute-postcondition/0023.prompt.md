Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, and `a` will be the sum of all input integers `f` for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the same value as `m`, which is the total number of iterations the loop ran. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` represent the inputs read from the user for each iteration, and `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values read from the input over the course of the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `4 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
