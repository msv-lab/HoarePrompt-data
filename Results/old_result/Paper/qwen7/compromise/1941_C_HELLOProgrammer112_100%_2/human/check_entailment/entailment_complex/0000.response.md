Reasoning:

The given function attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the input string `s`. However, the logic used to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful is flawed. Specifically, the expression `x + y - z` does not correctly calculate the minimum deletions needed.

Here's why the given solution is incorrect:

1. **Counting Substrings**: The function correctly counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie". However, these counts alone do not provide enough information to determine the minimum deletions required.

2. **Expression Analysis**: 
   - `x` (count of "map") + `y` (count of "pie") gives the total number of occurrences of both substrings.
   - `z` (count of "mapie") is subtracted because "mapie" is counted twice in `x` and `y` but should only be counted once.

3. **Flaw in Logic**: The expression `x + y - z` does not account for the overlapping nature of the substrings. For example, if "mapie" appears in the string, it means that part of "map" and "pie" is already covered, but the function still counts them separately. This leads to an overestimation of the deletions needed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through the string and remove the minimum number of characters to avoid both "map" and "pie" substrings. A more accurate approach would involve checking for the presence of "map" and "pie" and removing the necessary characters to break these substrings.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
