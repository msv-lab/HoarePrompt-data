Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Range of Values**: The value of the dummy variable `_` will be determined by the input from the user. The input is expected to be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will execute once for each value of the input, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input will be a valid integer within the specified range.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input will be a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
