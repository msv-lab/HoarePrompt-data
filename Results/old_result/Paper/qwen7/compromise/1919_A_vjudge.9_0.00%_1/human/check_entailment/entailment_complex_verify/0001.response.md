### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them, but after choosing, they must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because:
     - After the first move (removing one coin), the total becomes odd.
     - The second player (Bob) can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that the total remains odd until the end.
     - When the total is odd, the second player (Bob) will always be able to make a valid move until the end, leaving the first player (Alice) without a valid move.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it returns 'Bob', otherwise 'Alice'.
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the total number of coins is even or odd.
   - The function `func_2` correctly applies this logic to each test case and prints the results.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation that needs to be addressed. Specifically, the game mechanics imply that the player whose turn it is when the total number of coins is odd will always win, because they can always mirror the opponent's moves until the end. Conversely, the player whose turn it is when the total number of coins is even will always lose, because they will eventually face a situation where they cannot make a valid move.

Given the annotated code and the original assessment, the function `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. However, the original assessment incorrectly states that Alice will lose if the total number of coins is even, which is actually the opposite of what should happen. Therefore, the function `func_1` should return 'Alice' if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and 'Bob' otherwise.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Alice'
    else:
        return 'Bob'
```

With this correction, the function `func_1` now correctly reflects the game mechanics.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect because it stated that Alice would lose if the total number of coins is even, which is the opposite of what should happen. The corrected function should return 'Alice' if the total number of coins is even.

### Response:
Reasoning: The original assessment was incorrect because it incorrectly stated that Alice would lose if the total number of coins is even. The corrected function should return 'Alice' if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and 'Bob' otherwise.
Final: **False**
