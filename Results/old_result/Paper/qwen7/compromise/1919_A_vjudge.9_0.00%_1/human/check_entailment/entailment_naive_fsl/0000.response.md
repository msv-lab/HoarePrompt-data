Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the game rules. According to the problem description, the game involves taking turns and removing one coin from the current wallet until a player cannot make a valid move. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not simulate these turns or the removal of coins. Instead, they simply determine the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. This approach does not account for the sequence of moves or the fact that players can choose to swap wallets, which significantly affects the outcome of the game.

For example, consider the test case where Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 4 coins:
- If Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice will lose because she will eventually run out of coins to remove after swapping wallets with Bob. The provided functions do not reflect this logic and incorrectly determine that Alice will win.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and fails to handle the optimal play scenario, making it incorrect.
