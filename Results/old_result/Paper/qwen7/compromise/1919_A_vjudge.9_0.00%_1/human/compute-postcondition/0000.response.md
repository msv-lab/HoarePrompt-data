Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive**.

Explanation: The code reads an input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the code is executed. The other conditions and constraints on `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are not affected by this code snippet.
