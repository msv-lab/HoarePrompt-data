Output State: **`r` is equal to the length of list `B`, `idx_B` is a list of integers representing the indices of '<' characters in `s` from right to left, and `B` is a list of integers where each element is calculated based on the positions of '>' in `s` according to the given logic inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code `r = len(B)` assigns the length of the list `B` to the variable `r`. The lengths of `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, and the logic for calculating elements in `B` based on the positions of '>' in `s` is not executed here, so the state of `idx_B` and `B` remains as per the initial state.
