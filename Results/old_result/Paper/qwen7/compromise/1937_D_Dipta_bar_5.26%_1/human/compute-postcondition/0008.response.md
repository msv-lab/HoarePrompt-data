Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(0, n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 in the given range.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range, which is the length of the string `s`.

3. **Check the initial state of other objects**:
   - `idx_B` is an empty list.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `A` is a list of integers where each element is calculated based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_A` is a list of indices where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s`.

4. **Adjust the states of the variables in the loop head**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments until it reaches `n-1`, we need to ensure that `j` can take all values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop execution.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`, so it should be set correctly.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `idx_B` being an empty list does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `s` is already defined as a string of length `n`.
   - `A` and `idx_A` are derived from `s` and will be updated inside the loop, so their initial states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `j` starting from 0 and `n` being the length of the string `s`.

**State:**
**`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`**
