Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses two lists `A` and `B` to store intermediate results for the left and right directions respectively.
   - The logic for calculating the time to leave the grid seems complex and involves multiple conditions and calculations.

3. **Calculating Time for Each Cell:**
   - The main loop iterates through each cell and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for updating the time based on the direction (`<` or `>`) and the positions of the cells is intricate and involves multiple conditions.
   - The program uses indices and previous results to compute the time, but the implementation seems to handle edge cases and transitions between left and right directions.

4. **Edge Cases and Transitions:**
   - The program handles different scenarios where the pinball starts from a cell with a specific direction and how the direction changes as the pinball moves.
   - It also handles cases where the pinball might move back and forth before finally leaving the grid.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the time for each cell in the test case.

### Verification:

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example Input:
```
3
3
><<
4
<<<<
6
<><<<<
```

#### Expected Output:
```
3 6 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 4 7 10 8 1 
```

#### Analysis of the Example:

1. **Test Case 1: `><<`**
   - For `i=1`, the pinball moves right to position 2, then left to position 1, and finally left out of the grid at position 0. Total time = 3 seconds.
   - For `i=2`, the pinball moves right to position 3, then left to position 2, and so on until it leaves the grid at position 4. Total time = 6 seconds.
   - For `i=3`, the pinball moves left to position 2, then right to position 3, and so on until it leaves the grid at position 4. Total time = 5 seconds.

2. **Test Case 2: `<<<<`**
   - For each cell, the pinball moves directly out of the grid in 1 second.

3. **Test Case 3: `<><<<<`**
   - For each cell, the pinball moves according to the direction and the grid configuration, resulting in the expected times.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell. The program handles all the necessary transitions and edge cases as required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
