### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is called with the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis:**
   - The function calculates two lists, `A` and `B`, which store values based on the positions of `>` and `<` respectively.
   - List `A` is built by iterating from left to right, and `B` is built by iterating from right to left.
   - These calculations seem to be related to the time it takes for a pinball to move from the start to the end of the grid.

3. **Calculation of Pinball Movement Time:**
   - The function then uses these lists to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - The logic involves complex arithmetic operations based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters, and it seems to account for the direction changes and the grid boundaries.

4. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when there are no `>` or `<` characters, or when the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid.
   - The logic appears to correctly handle these cases and provide the expected output.

5. **Output Generation:**
   - The function prints the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell, which matches the expected output format.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid based on the given rules. The calculations and handling of edge cases appear to be accurate.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is correct based on the problem description and the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
