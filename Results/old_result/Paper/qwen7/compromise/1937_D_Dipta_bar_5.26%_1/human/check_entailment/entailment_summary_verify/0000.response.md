### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
- Each cell contains a character `<` or `>` indicating the direction the pinball should move.
- The pinball moves according to the rules specified.
- We need to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell position.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_1` computes and prints a series of values based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters in the string.
- The output reflects the relative positions and counts of `>` and `<` characters, providing a detailed analysis of their distribution.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Calculating Prefix Sums (`A`):**
   - The program initializes two lists `A` and `idx_A` to store prefix sums and indices of `>` characters.
   - For each character in `s`, if it is `>`, it updates the prefix sum and appends the index to `idx_A`.

3. **Calculating Suffix Sums (`B`):**
   - Similarly, the program initializes two lists `B` and `idx_B` to store suffix sums and indices of `<` characters.
   - For each character in `s` (reversed), if it is `<`, it updates the suffix sum and appends the index to `idx_B`.

4. **Main Calculation Loop:**
   - The program iterates through each cell position `i` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on the character at `i`, it uses the prefix and suffix sums to compute the time.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Time:**
   - The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the time. The current implementation seems to be overly complex and does not correctly account for the movement and inversion rules.
   - The program does not accurately reflect the movement of the pinball and the inversion of directions.

2. **Complexity and Incorrect Logic:**
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums and the subsequent complex calculations do not align with the simple movement rules described in the problem.
   - The program attempts to handle the movement and inversion in a way that is not straightforward and leads to incorrect results.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the example test case provided:
```
1
3
>><
```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3 2 3 
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  3 6 3 
  ```

- Explanation:
  - For `i = 1`, the pinball starts at `>` and moves to the right, taking 3 seconds to reach the end.
  - For `i = 2`, the pinball starts at `<` and moves to the left, taking 2 seconds to reach the start.
  - For `i = 3`, the pinball starts at `>` and moves to the right, taking 3 seconds to reach the end.

The actual output is incorrect because the program does not correctly handle the movement and inversion rules.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for all test cases due to the flawed logic and incorrect handling of the movement and inversion rules.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
