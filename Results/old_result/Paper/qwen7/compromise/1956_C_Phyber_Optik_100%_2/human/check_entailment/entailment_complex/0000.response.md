Reasoning:
- The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
- The provided solution attempts to achieve this by performing operations of two types, but the logic implemented does not align with the problem's requirements.
- Specifically, the solution calculates a sum using a formula that does not relate to the matrix operations required to maximize the sum.
- The solution also prints \( 2n \) operations, but these operations do not correctly fill the matrix to achieve the maximum possible sum.
- The operations printed are simply setting each element in a row and column to a sequence from 1 to \( n \), which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
