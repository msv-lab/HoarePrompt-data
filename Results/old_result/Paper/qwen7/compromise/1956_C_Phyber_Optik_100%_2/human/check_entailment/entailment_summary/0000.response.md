Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute rows or columns.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It then calculates a sum using the formula `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). This calculation does not relate to the problem's requirements.
   - It prints the calculated sum and \( 2n \).
   - It then prints two permutations for each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), but these permutations do not seem to follow the rules of the problem (they are simply printing a sequence from 1 to \( n \) without any permutation logic).

3. **Correct Solution**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to fill the matrix such that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is the maximum possible value, which is \( n \).
   - We can achieve this by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, each setting the entire row or column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
