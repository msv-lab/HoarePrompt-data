Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `1`: This is a constant value.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 3, this expression simplifies to `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual elements starting from 1 up to `n`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The first part of the print statement is `1`.
   - The second part is `n - 2`.
   - The third part is the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

5. **Final Output**:
   - Given `j = 3`, the output will be `1` followed by `n - 2`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, let's denote it as `n` for the general case. The specific value of `n` does not affect the structure of the output, only the range of numbers.

Output: **1, n - 2, 1 2 ... n**
