Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `n`**: 
   - The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1.
   - `n` is an input parameter and its initial value is not specified in the problem statement, but it must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `j` must be within the range `[1, n]`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by setting the initial values of `j` and `n` appropriately.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Initial Value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` set to 1.
2. **Initial Value of `n`**: `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Since the loop will increment `j` starting from 1 up to `n`, we need to ensure that `j` is set to 1 and `n` is a positive integer.

### Final State After Adjustments:

- `j` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be a positive integer.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer**
