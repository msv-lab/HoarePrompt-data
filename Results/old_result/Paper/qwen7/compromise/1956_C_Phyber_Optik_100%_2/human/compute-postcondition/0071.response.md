Output State: `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum` is 9240, and `n` is the original input integer.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n`. The variable `i` will also be `n + 1` since it is incremented in the inner loop but not reset, and the loop does not change the value of `n`. The variable `sum` remains 9240 because it is only calculated once during the first iteration and is not modified afterward.
