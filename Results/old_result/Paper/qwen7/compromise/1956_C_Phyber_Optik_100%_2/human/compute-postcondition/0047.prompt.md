Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` from 2 up to `n`. After `i` reaches `n`, the loop terminates. Given the pattern observed in the provided output states, we can deduce the formula for `sum`. For each iteration, the value added to `sum` is `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, which simplifies to `3 * i^2 - 3 * i + 1`. Summing these values from `i=2` to `i=n` results in a specific formula for `sum`. For `n=5`, the sum is calculated as follows:

- For `i=2`: `3 * 2^2 - 3 * 2 + 1 = 7`
- For `i=3`: `3 * 3^2 - 3 * 3 + 1 = 22`
- For `i=4`: `3 * 4^2 - 3 * 4 + 1 = 43`

Summing these: `7 + 22 + 43 + (values for i from 5 to n)` results in `sum` being `9240` when `n` is sufficiently large. Since the exact calculation for larger `n` is complex without a direct formula, we can conclude based on the pattern that the final `sum` after all iterations will be `9240` for the given conditions.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
