Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `2` to `n + 1`, inclusive.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is updated to its current value plus \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\), where `i` must be at least 2.
   - This means that the loop has just completed an iteration with some value of `i`.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop starts from `2` and increments `i` by `1` each time, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The `sum` value remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The `i` value needs to be updated to `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i` must be at least `2` still holds true.

Given that the previous iteration ended with `i` being at least `2`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: `sum` is updated to its current value plus (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i, where `i` must be at least 3.**
