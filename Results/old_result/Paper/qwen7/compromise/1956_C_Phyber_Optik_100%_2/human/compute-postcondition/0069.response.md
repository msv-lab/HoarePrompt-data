Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, starting with `j` set to 1 and incrementing `j` by 1 each iteration. After all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1`. The variable `i` will also be `n + 1` after the loop completes, as it is not reassigned within the loop. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is an input parameter.

If we consider the loop code provided, the loop will print the same sequence of numbers for each iteration, which does not affect the final values of the variables. Therefore, the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:

- `sum` is 0 (since no additions to `sum` are performed in the loop body),
- `j` is `n + 1`,
- `i` is `n + 1`,
- `n` is the original input integer.

Output State: `sum` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the original input integer.
