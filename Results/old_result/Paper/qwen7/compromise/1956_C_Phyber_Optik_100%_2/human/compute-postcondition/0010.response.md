Output State: **`sum` is updated to its current value plus (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code updates `sum` by adding the value of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 3, the expression evaluates to `(3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 = (9 - 4) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`. Therefore, `sum` is updated to its current value plus 15. Also, `i` is incremented to 4. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 remains unchanged.
