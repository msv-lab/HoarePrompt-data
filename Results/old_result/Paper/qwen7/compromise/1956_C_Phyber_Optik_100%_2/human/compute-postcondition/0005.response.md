Output State: **`sum` is updated to its current value plus (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i, where `i` must be at least 2.**

This means that the variable `sum` has been updated by adding the value of \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) to its current value. The value of `i` must be at least 2, as per the initial state condition. The other variables remain unchanged.
