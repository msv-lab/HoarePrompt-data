Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). It calculates a sum based on the formula provided and prints the sum along with \( 2n \). Additionally, it prints two lines for each value of \( j \) ranging from 1 to \( n \), where \( j \) is the loop variable. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
