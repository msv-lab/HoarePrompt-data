Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    sum = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
    print(sum, n + n)
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will have executed for all values of `j` from 1 to `n`, printing the sequence `1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1)` and then `2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1)` for each `j`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a series of printed lines where the first element is 1 or 2, the second element is `n - j + 1` for decreasing values of `j` from `n` to 1, followed by the range of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, printed twice per line for each `j`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop will print `n` lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`. Each line will start with either 1 or 2, followed by `n - j + 1`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` listed twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `j` is `n+1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240.

Explanation: Based on the provided code and the initial conditions, the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Each iteration prints two lines but does not modify any variable outside its scope, specifically `sum`, `i`, or `n`. The variable `j` increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n+1`. Since the loop does not change the value of `sum` and the initial condition specifies that `sum` is 9240, the value of `sum` remains unchanged after all iterations. Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will be `n+1`, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5, and `sum` will still be 9240.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop runs `n` times, starting with `j` set to 1 and incrementing `j` by 1 in each iteration. After all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n + 1`, `n` will remain unchanged as it is an input parameter, and `i` will also be `n + 1` since the loop does not change its value directly but `i` is not used in the loop body. Each iteration prints two lines, but these lines do not affect the variables' values.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: `sum` is not defined in this context, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is the original input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
