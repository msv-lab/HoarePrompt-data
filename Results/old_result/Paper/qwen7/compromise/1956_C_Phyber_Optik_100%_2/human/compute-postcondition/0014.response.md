Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The loop body is omitted, but it updates the variable `sum` by adding some value based on `j`.

### Expression Inside the Loop
The expression inside the loop is implied to update `sum` by adding a certain value. Based on the context, the value added to `sum` in each iteration is derived from the formula \(2j^2 - j\).

### Loop Head Variables
The loop head contains the following variables:
- `j`: The loop variable that ranges from 1 to `n`.
- `n`: The upper limit of the loop.

### State Adjustment
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the initial values of the loop variables `j` and `n`.

1. **Variable `j`**: The loop starts with `j` set to 1 and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration until `j` reaches `n`. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `j` should be 1.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

### Final State
The initial state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
- `j` is 1
- `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0

Thus, the final state before the loop starts is:
**State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0**
