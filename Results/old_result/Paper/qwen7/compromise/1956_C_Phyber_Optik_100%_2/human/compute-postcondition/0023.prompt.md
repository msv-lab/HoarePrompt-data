Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The final value of `sum` will be the sum of the expression \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

To understand this, let's break down the expression inside the loop:

\[
(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i = (i^2 - (i-1)^2) * i = (i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) * i = (2i - 1) * i = 2i^2 - i
\]

So, the loop updates `sum` by adding \(2i^2 - i\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). Therefore, the final value of `sum` will be the sum of \(2i^2 - i\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is: The value of `sum` will be the sum of the series \(2i^2 - i\) for all integers \(i\) starting from 2 up to the given integer `n`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 2, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 3, `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
