Output State: **`sum` is 56, `j` is `n+1`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**

Explanation: The code updates `sum` by adding the value of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. Given `i` is 4, the calculation inside the parentheses simplifies to `(4 * 4 - 3 * 3) * 4 = (16 - 9) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28`. Since `sum` was initially 28, the new value of `sum` is `28 + 28 = 56`. The values of `j`, `i`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
