Output State: **`cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `b`; n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; a is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `cb = Counter(sorted(b))` creates a `Counter` object named `cb` that contains the counts of each unique element in the sorted list `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
