Output State: **`score` is 0, `start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= start_pos <= n, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of integers representing the array a; `current_pos` is set to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0; `visited` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `visited`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`score`, `start_pos`, `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `current_pos`, `steps`).
