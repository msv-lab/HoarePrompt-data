The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (the number of cases), a positive integer \( n \) (the length of the string), and a string \( s \) consisting of 'U' and 'D'. For each test case, it checks if the count of 'U' in the string \( s \) is odd or even and appends 'yes' or 'no' to the results list accordingly. Finally, it prints each element in the results list, one per line.
