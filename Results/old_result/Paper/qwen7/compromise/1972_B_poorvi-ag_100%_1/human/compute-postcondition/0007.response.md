Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs t, n, and s where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". For each test case defined by t, the function returns a specific value based on the string s.**

This means the function indirectly accepts parameters through its processing logic, specifically:
- `t`: The number of test cases.
- `n`: The length of the string `s`.
- `s`: A string consisting of "U" (up) and "D" (down) characters.

For each test case defined by `t`, the function evaluates the string `s` and returns a value based on the sequence of "U" and "D" characters.
