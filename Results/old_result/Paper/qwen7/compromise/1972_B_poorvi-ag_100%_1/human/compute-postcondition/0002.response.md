State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
2. The loop condition `range(t)` means the loop will run `t` times.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
4. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), we need to ensure this condition is met.
5. The state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains unchanged.
6. Therefore, the only adjustments needed are to ensure `t` is within the specified range and set `i` to 0.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
