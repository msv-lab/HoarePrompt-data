Output State: **`k` is 4, `no_path` is False**

The code sets `no_path` to `False`, which overrides the condition based on `b[2]`. Since the initial state specified that `no_path` would be `False` only if `b[2]` is not equal to '>', the assignment directly sets `no_path` to `False` without depending on the value of `b[2]`. The value of `k` remains unchanged.
