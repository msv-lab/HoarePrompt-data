Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 because `range(int(input()))` generates a sequence starting from 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`. Therefore, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts at 0).

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the initial state of `i` and the input value.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even.
- Each test case consists of two strings of length `n`, where each character is either `<` or `>`.

Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the initial state of `i` should be 0, and the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be at least 1**
