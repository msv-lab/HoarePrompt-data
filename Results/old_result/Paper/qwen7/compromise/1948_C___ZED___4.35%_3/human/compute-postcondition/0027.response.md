Output State: **`b` is a list, `n` must be at least 2, and every even-indexed element of `b` up to `n-2` is not equal to '>', and `no_path` is True**

Explanation: The variable `no_path` is directly assigned the value `True`, overriding its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
