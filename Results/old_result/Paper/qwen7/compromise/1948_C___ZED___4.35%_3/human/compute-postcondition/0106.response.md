Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` will be equal to `n-2`.
- `no_path` will be `True` if any `a[k]` (where `k` is odd and less than `n`) is not equal to '>', otherwise `no_path` will remain `True` if it was not set to `False` during the loop.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `k` or `no_path`, and it directly prints the string `'YES'`, the output is:

Output: **YES**
