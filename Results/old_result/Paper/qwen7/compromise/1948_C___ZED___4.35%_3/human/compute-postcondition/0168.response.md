Output State: **i is 3, n retains its original value, a and b remain as the strings input by the user in the third iteration.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 3, indicating that the loop has completed three full cycles. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged from their state after the third iteration of the loop, meaning they will be the same as when the loop finished its third iteration. Specifically, `b[-2]` was not '>' in the third iteration, and no further changes were made to `n`, `a`, or `b` within the loop body after the third iteration.
