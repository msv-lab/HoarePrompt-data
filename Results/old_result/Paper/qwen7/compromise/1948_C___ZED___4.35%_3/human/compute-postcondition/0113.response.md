Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Other variables**:
   - `a` is the new input string from the user.
   - `b` is the input string from the user.
   - `k` and `no_path` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted here.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is the new input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>'**.
