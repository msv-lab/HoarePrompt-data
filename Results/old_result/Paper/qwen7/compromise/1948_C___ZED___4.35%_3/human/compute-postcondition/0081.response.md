Output State: `k` is equal to `n-2`, `no_path` is **False**.

Explanation: The loop runs in increments of 2 from 0 to `n-2`. After the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be `n-2`. Since the loop sets `no_path` to **False** as soon as it finds a character in `b` that is not '>', and given that the loop has executed fully, `no_path` remains **False**.
