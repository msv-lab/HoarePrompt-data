Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved here are `k` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than `n` and `k` increments by 2 each time.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a list.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - The `(k_end + 2)`-th element of `b` is not equal to `'>'.
   - `no_path` remains `False`.

4. **Determine the new value of `k`**: Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 2 each time, if `k_end` was the value of `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then the next value of `k` would be `k_end + 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `k` will be updated to `k_end + 2`.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - The `(k_end + 2)`-th element of `b` should not be `'>'`.
   - `no_path` should remain `False`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`b` is a list, `n` must be at least 2, and the `(k_end + 2)`-th element of `b` is not equal to '>', and `no_path` remains `False`**.

Since `k` is incremented by 2, the new value of `k` is `k_end + 2`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`b` is a list, `k` is `k_end + 2`, `n` must be at least 2, and the `(k_end + 2)`-th element of `b` is not equal to '>', and `no_path` remains `False`**.
