Output State: `k` is equal to `n-1` (since the loop increments `k` by 2 each time and stops just before `k` reaches `n`), `no_path` is **False**.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `k` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop increments `k` by 2 starting from 0 up to but not including `n`. The variable `no_path` will be **False** because the loop sets `no_path` to **False** if any character in the range `[0, n-1, 2]` of the string `b` is not '>'.
