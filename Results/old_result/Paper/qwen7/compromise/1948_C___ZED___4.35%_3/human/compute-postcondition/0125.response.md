Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. Here, the loop variable is `k`, and the range is from `0` to `n` with a step of `2`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is within the range `[0, n-1]` and `k` is incremented by `2` each iteration.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `0`.
   - The postcondition is that if `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is `False`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `k`**: Since `k` starts at `0` and increments by `2` each iteration, the next value of `k` would be `2`.

5. **Check the Postcondition for the New Value of `k`**: For `k = 2`, the postcondition needs to be checked. The postcondition is that if `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` is `False`.

6. **Adjust the State**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `k` and the postcondition involving `no_path` and `b[2]`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, if `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` is `False`**
