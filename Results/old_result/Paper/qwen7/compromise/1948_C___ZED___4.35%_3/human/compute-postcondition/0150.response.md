Output State: **`k` is 5, `n` retains its original value, and `no_path` is False**

The code simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `no_path`. Since `k` and `n` retain their original values (5 and the original value of `n` respectively), and `no_path` is explicitly set to `False`, these are the updated states of the variables.
