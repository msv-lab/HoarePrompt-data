Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `k` is 2
- If `b[2]` is not equal to '>', then `no_path` is False

### Loop Head
```
for k in range(0, n, 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `k` is being incremented by 2 each time. The loop starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1` in steps of 2.
2. **Current Value of `k`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 2.
3. **Next Value of `k`**: Since `k` is incremented by 2, the next value of `k` will be `2 + 2 = 4`.
4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `k < n`.

### Adjusting the States
- **`k`**: The value of `k` will be updated to 4.
- **`no_path`**: The value of `no_path` remains unchanged unless `b[4]` is not equal to '>', but since we don't know the value of `b[4]` yet, we cannot determine if `no_path` will change.

### Final State
- `k` is 4
- `no_path` remains unchanged (unless `b[4]` is not equal to '>')

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`k` is 4, if `b[2]` is not equal to '>', then `no_path` is False**
