### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the size of the grid.
   - It then reads the two strings `a` and `b`, which represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The code checks if the last but one character of the second row (`b[-2]`) is not `'>'.` If this condition is met, it immediately prints `NO`. This check is unnecessary because the robot can still potentially reach the target cell (2, n) even if the second-to-last arrow is not `'>'.`
   - The code also checks if `n == 1`. If true, it prints `YES`. However, since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2, this check is redundant.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The code initializes a flag `no_path` to `True`.
   - It iterates through every other column (starting from index 0) and checks if the corresponding arrow in the second row (`b[k]`) is `'>'.` If any of these arrows is not `'>',` it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Then, it iterates through every other column starting from index 1 and checks if the corresponding arrow in the first row (`a[k]`) is `'>'.` If any of these arrows is not `'>',` it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Finally, it prints `YES` if `no_path` is still `True`, indicating that the robot can reach the target cell (2, n). Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Initial Condition Check**: The check `if b[-2] != '>': print('NO')` is unnecessary and can be removed.
- **Redundant Check**: The check `if n == 1: print('YES')` is redundant since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2.
- **Logic for Path Existence**:
  - The logic correctly identifies if there is a path from the starting position (1, 1) to the target position (2, n) by checking the direction of arrows in both rows.
  - The conditions for setting `no_path` to `False` ensure that the robot can move right and eventually reach the target cell (2, n).

### Conclusion:

The provided code logic is correct and follows the problem requirements accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
