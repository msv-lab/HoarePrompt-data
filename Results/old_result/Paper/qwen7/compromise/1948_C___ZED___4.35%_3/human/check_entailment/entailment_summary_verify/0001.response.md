### Reasoning:

The original program has significant issues in simulating the robot's movement and determining if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. Let's break down the problems and verify the corrected program:

#### Original Program Issues:

1. **Incomplete Check for Second Row:**
   - The check `if b[-2] != '>'` is insufficient. It only checks the second last column and does not ensure the robot can reach the last column.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Single Column Case:**
   - The condition `if n == 1` should not return 'YES' because the robot cannot move from `(1, 1)` to `(2, 1)` in a single column grid.

3. **Incorrect Path Checking:**
   - The logic for checking paths in the first and second rows is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the robot's movement considering both rows simultaneously.

#### Corrected Program Explanation:

1. **Check if the Last Column Can Be Reached:**
   - If the last column in the second row is a left arrow (`<`), the robot cannot reach the last column, so the program prints 'NO'.

2. **Simulate the Robot's Movement:**
   - Initialize the robot's position at `(1, 1)`.
   - Loop through each column, updating the row and column based on the direction of the arrows in both rows.
   - If the robot reaches the last column in the second row, print 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, print 'NO'.

This corrected program ensures that the robot's movement is properly simulated and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: True**

The corrected program accurately simulates the robot's movement and correctly determines if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
