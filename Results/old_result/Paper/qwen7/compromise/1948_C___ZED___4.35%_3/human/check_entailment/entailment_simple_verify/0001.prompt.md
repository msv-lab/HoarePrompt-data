You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of columns.
   - It then reads two strings `a` and `b` representing the first and second rows of the grid respectively.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `b[-2]` (the second last character of the second row) is not `'>`', the program prints 'NO'. This check is incomplete because it only considers the second last column and does not account for the entire path.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'YES'. This is incorrect because the problem specifies that `n` is at least 2.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program sets `no_path` to `True` initially.
   - It iterates through every second column in the second row (`b`). If any of these columns have a `<` (left arrow), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - After this loop, if `no_path` is still `True`, it means there is a continuous path of `>` (right arrows) from the start to the end of the second row.
   - Next, it checks the first row (`a`) in a similar manner but only for odd-indexed columns. If any of these columns have a `<` (left arrow), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Finally, if `no_path` is still `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incomplete Check for Second Row:**
   - The check `if b[-2] != '>'` is insufficient. It only checks the second last column and does not ensure the robot can reach the last column.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Single Column Case:**
   - The condition `if n == 1` should not return 'YES' because the robot cannot move from `(1, 1)` to `(2, 1)` in a single column grid.

3. **Incorrect Path Checking:**
   - The logic for checking paths in the first and second rows is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the robot's movement considering both rows simultaneously.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement through both rows and ensure it can reach `(2, n)`.

### Corrected Program

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the last column can be reached
        if b[-1] == '<':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        row = 1
        col = 1
        while col < n:
            if row == 1:
                if a[col] == '<':
                    row = 2
                else:
                    col += 1
            else:
                if b[col] == '<':
                    row = 1
                else:
                    col += 1
        
        if col == n and row == 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has several logical flaws and does not correctly simulate the robot's movement. The corrected program ensures the robot's movement is properly simulated and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
