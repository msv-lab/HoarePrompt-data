Output State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are assigned or modified, their values remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
