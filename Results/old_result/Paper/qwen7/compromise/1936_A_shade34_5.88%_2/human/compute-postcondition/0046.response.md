Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `n-1` and `i` (which is `n-1`), `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, `pans` now contains both `n-1` and `i` (which is `n-1`). All other variables remain unchanged.
