Output State: `mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is `n-1` (the last iteration index), `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1` inclusive, `s` is the string entered by the user during the last iteration, and `n` is the input integer from the user. If the user inputs '<' at any point, `pans` will contain the last value of `i` where '<' was input. Otherwise, if the user inputs '=' each time, `pans` will contain all integers from `0` to `n-1` in order.
