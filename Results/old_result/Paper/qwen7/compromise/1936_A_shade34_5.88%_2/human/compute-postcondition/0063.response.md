Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`.**

Explanation: The line `mak = 0` sets the value of `mak` to 0. All other variables (`mak2`, `i`, `pans`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
