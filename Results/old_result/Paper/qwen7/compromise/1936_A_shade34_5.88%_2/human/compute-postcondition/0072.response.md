Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is equal to `n`.
- `mak2` is equal to `n-1`.
- `i` is equal to `n + 1`.
- `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `n+1`.
- `s` is the string `'> '` (though this is not used in the print statement).
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed (though this does not affect the content printed).

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is `n`, `pans[mak]` refers to the `n`-th element in the list `pans`. Given that `pans` is `[n-1, n-1, n, n+1]`, the `n`-th element (which is the last one) is `n+1`.
- `pans[mak]` again: This is the same as above, so it is also `n+1`.
- `pans[i]`: Since `i` is `n + 1`, `pans[i]` refers to the `(n+1)`-th element in the list `pans`. However, since the list only has 4 elements (index range from 0 to 3), this would be out of bounds if we were to access it directly. But in the context of the list, it would refer to the last element, which is `n+1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? n+1 n+1 n+1 n+1**
