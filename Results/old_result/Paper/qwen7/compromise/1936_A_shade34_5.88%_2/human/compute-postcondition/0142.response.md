Output State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 2 or 3, `pans` is either `['0', 1, 2]` or `['0', 1, 3]`, `s` is the string entered by the user, `n` is the input integer from the user, `s` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is either 2 or 3) to the list `pans`. Since `pans` was initially either `['0', 1]` or `[0, 1]`, after appending `i`, it becomes either `['0', 1, 2]` or `['0', 1, 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
