Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is `n-1`
- `mak2` is `n - 1`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` must be greater than `1`
- `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.

We need to determine the values that will be printed by the statement `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`.

1. `mak` is `n-1`.
2. `mak2` is `n - 1` (same as `mak`).
3. `i` is `n - 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak` (which is `n-1`), then another `mak` (again `n-1`), then `i` (which is also `n-1`), and finally another `i` (also `n-1`).

Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1'**
