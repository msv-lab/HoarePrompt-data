Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to `mak`. The other variables (`mak2`, `i`, `pans`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
