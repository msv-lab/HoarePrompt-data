Output State: **`i` is 1, `pans` is a list of length `n`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `pans`. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the console or file immediately. Since no variables are modified by this operation, their values remain unchanged.
