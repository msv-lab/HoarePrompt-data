Output State: **mak2 is equal to n-1, mak is equal to n-1, i is equal to n, pans is a list containing the elements n-1, n-1, n, and possibly n if the condition s == '=' was met during the loop iterations, and s is the string input by the user as a result of str(input()).**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` inclusive, so the last value of `i` will be `n-1`, but since the loop increments `i` at the end of each iteration, `i` will become `n` after the loop exits. The variable `mak2` remains equal to `mak`, which is `n-1`. The variable `pans` will contain the list of indices that satisfied the condition `s == '<'` or `s == '='` during the loop iterations. If `s` was `=` at any point, `n` will be appended to `pans`. The variable `s` will be the last string input by the user as a result of the final call to `str(input())` inside the loop.
