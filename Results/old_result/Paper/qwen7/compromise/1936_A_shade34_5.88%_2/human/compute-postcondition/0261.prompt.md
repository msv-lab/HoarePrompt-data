You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with an external entity to query bitwise operations on a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \), which is a permutation of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). The interaction involves making at most \(3n\) queries to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, mak)
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: Output State: mak is 0, mak2 is 0, pans is a list containing the elements from n-1 down to 0, and i is n-1. The variable `s` will be '>' for all comparisons within the loop, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed as necessary during each iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, `mak` and `mak2` both end up being 0 because `mak` is reset to 0 at the start of each new iteration of the outer loop. The list `pans` contains the permutation of indices from n-1 down to 0, as it was built up over the iterations without any changes being made to it. The variable `i` is set to n-1, indicating the last index processed in the final iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, where \(p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\) is a permutation of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\) and can be queried through bitwise operations using at most \(3n\) interactions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
