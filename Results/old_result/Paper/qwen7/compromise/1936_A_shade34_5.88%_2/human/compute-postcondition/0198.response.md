Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `n-1`
- `n` must be at least 3

We need to determine the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` to understand what will be printed. However, the initial state does not provide explicit values for `mak` and `mak2`. Therefore, we can only describe these variables in terms of their relationship to `i`.

Given:
- `i = n - 1`
- Since `n` is at least 3, the minimum value for `i` is 2 (when `n = 3`).

The values of `mak` and `mak2` are not specified, so we cannot determine their exact values. We can only state that they are some values that are being referenced.

Thus, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` (which are the same as `mak2`), but since `mak` and `mak2` are not explicitly defined, we can only refer to them as such.

Output: **'? mak mak2 2-1 mak2' (where `mak` and `mak2` are unspecified values, and `i` is `n-1` with `n` at least 3)**
