Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list of length `n`, and `mak` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '>' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, the value of `mak` is updated to `i` if the input is '>'. Since the loop runs `n-1` times (from 1 to `n-1`), if the input is '>' for all these iterations, `mak` will end up being `n-1`. If the input is not '>', `mak` remains 0 throughout the loop. The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes all its iterations, and `pans` remains a list of all integers from 0 to `n-1` as it is not modified within the loop.
