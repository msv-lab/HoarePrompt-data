Output State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.**

In Natural Language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `mak` will be `n`, `mak2` will remain `n - 1`, `i` will also be `n`, `pans` will contain the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, and `s` will still be the string `'>', n` where `n` is the input integer. This state holds true assuming that the input string was `<` each time, causing `mak` to increment to `n` after 3 iterations.
