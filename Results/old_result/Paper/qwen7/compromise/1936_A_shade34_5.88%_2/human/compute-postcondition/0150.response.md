Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `pans` is a list of length `n`, but the specific values within the list are not provided.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. `pans` is a list of length `n`, but the values are not specified.
3. The indices `mak` and `i` are used in the print statement. Since `i` is 1, `pans[i]` will refer to the first element of the `pans` list.

Given this information, the print statement will output:
- A question mark (`?`).
- The value of `pans[mak]` (which is unknown without knowing the value of `mak`).
- The value of `pans[mak]` again.
- The value of `pans[i]`, which is the first element of the `pans` list.
- The value of `pans[i]` again.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]' (where [pans[mak]] is the value at index mak in the list pans, and [pans[1]] is the first element of the list pans)**
