Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is equal to `n`
- `mak2` is equal to `n`
- `i` is either 2 or 3
- `pans` is either `['0', 1]` or `[0, 1]` (both represent the same list)
- `s` is the string entered by the user
- `n` is the input integer from the user

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` and `mak2` both have the value `n`, which is the input integer from the user.
- `i` is either 2 or 3.
- `mak2` again has the value `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a string followed by the value of `n` twice, and then the value of `i`.

Output: **'? [n] [n] [2 or 3]'**
