Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `s` is the string input by the user.

However, the values of `mak` and `mak2` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since these variables are not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine their values from the given information. Therefore, we will represent them as `mak` and `mak2` in the output.

Given this, the print statement will output the string `"?"` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order.

Output: **"? mak mak2 n mak2"**
