Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be at least 3, but its exact value is not specified.
- `pans` is a list of length `n`.
- `mak` is explicitly given as 2.
- `k` is defined as `k-2`, but since `k` itself is not initialized, it's implied that `k` is not used in the print statement and only `mak` is relevant.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Given the values:
- `mak` is 2.
- `i` is 3.

The print statement will output:
Output: **'? 2 2 3 3'**
