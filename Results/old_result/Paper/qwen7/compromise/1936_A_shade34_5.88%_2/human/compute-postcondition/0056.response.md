Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing `[i]`, `mak` is `n`, `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`**.

Explanation: The line `pans = [i]` updates the list `pans` to contain only the element `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `pans` now contains `[n]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
