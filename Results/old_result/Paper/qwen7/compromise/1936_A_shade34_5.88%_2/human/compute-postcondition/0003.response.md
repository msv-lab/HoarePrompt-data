State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`, which means `i` will take values from 1 up to but not including `n`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start from 1 and `n` must be greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` will generate numbers starting from 1 up to `n-1`).
3. The variable `mak` is not used in the loop condition or initialization, so its value does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 1 and `n` being greater than 1.
