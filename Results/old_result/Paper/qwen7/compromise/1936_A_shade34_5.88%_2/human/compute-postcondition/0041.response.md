Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list that either contains the element `n-1` or contains `i` (which is `n-1`).
   - `s` is the string input by the user.
   - `s` is either not equal to `<` or equal to `=`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is `n-1`.
- `mak2` is also `n-1` because `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

Therefore, the values of the variables to be printed are:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `mak` (which is `n-1`)
- `mak2` (which is `n-1`)
- `i` (which is `n-1`)
- `mak2` (which is `n-1` again)

So, the print statement will output these values in the order specified.

Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1'**
