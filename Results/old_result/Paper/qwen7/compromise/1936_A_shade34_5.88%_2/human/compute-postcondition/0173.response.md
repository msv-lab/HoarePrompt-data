Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2`, `pans` is a list of length `n`, `mak` is 0, and `k` is `k-1`.**

Explanation: The line `mak = 0` sets the value of `mak` to 0. This overrides the previous condition where `mak` was set to `n-1` if the input string was `'>` for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`; otherwise, it remained 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
