Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is `n`
- `mak2` is `n`
- `i` is 0
- `pans` is an empty list
- `s` is the string `'>', n`
- `n` is the input integer

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down what this will print:

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is `n`.
- `mak2` is `n`.
- `i` is 0.
- `mak2` is `n`.

So, the print statement will output these values in the order they appear in the print statement.

Output: **'? n n 0 n'**
