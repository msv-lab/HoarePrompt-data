Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` contains the element `n-1`, `s` is the string input by the user, `s` is not equal to `<`, and the value of `s` is equal to '='.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to the list `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
