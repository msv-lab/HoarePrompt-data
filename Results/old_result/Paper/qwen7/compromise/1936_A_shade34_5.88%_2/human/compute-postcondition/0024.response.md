Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `pans`. The values of `mak2`, `mak`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state, as no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is also preserved.
