Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`
- `pans` is a list of length `n`
- `mak` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '>' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `n` or the input string, we need to consider both scenarios for `mak`:

1. If the input string is '>' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`, then `mak` will be `n-1`.
2. Otherwise, `mak` will remain 0.

However, since the exact input string is not provided, we cannot definitively determine the value of `mak`. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities.

Given this, let's break down the print statement:

- `'!'` is a constant string.
- `mak2` is not defined in the initial state, so it is not clear what value it holds. Since it is not mentioned, we assume it is not relevant to the output.
- `mak` can either be `n-1` or `0`.

Thus, the print statement will output one of the following:

- If the input string is '>' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`: `! n-1 n-1`
- Otherwise: `! 0 0`

Since we do not have enough information to determine the exact value of `mak2`, we can only provide the values of `!` and `mak`.

Output: **! [mak] [mak]** (where `[mak]` can be either `n-1` or `0` depending on the input string)
