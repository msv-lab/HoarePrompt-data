Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
   - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
   - No two disks overlap.
   - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Graph Representation**: The problem can be represented as a graph where each disk is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent. The goal is to check if we can reduce the radius of some disks while maintaining tangency and ensuring no overlap.

3. **DFS and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and calculate coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for each node. These coefficients help in determining how much the radius of each disk should be adjusted.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` are initialized for each node during the DFS traversal. For a node `i`, `coef0[i]` represents the sum of the original radii of the disks that are connected to `i` through tangency, and `coef1[i]` is set to 1 initially.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - After the DFS traversal, for each connected component, we check if the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero. If it is zero, it means there's no way to decrease the sum of radii for that component without violating the tangency condition.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly initializes the necessary arrays and starts the DFS traversal for each unvisited node.
   - The `dfs` function correctly updates the coefficients based on the tangency condition.
   - The logic to check if the sum of radii can be decreased is implemented correctly.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles cases where disks are tangent and ensures no overlap after adjusting the radii.
   - It correctly identifies components where the sum of radii can be decreased.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if the radii can be adjusted as required.

Correctness: **True**
