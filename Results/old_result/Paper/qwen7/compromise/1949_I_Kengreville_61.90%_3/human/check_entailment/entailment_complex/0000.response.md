### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the input and initializes necessary variables.
   - It iterates through each disk and performs a DFS if the disk hasn't been visited yet.
   - During DFS, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values for connected disks based on their distances and radii.
   - After processing all disks, it checks if any unvisited disk has a non-zero sum of `coef1` values. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

2. **Function `dfs()`**:
   - The DFS function marks the current disk as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
   - It then recursively visits all connected disks (disks that are tangent to the current disk).
   - For each connected disk, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values and calls itself recursively.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires determining if we can decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and no overlap.
   - The solution uses a system of linear equations derived from the tangency conditions between disks.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The DFS ensures that all connected components (groups of tangent disks) are processed.
   - The `coef0` and `coef1` values represent the linear equation system that needs to be solved to find valid new radii.
   - The check for `c1 != 0` ensures that there is a valid way to decrease the sum of radii without violating the tangency conditions.

Given the above analysis, the logic in both functions correctly implements the required algorithm to solve the problem.
