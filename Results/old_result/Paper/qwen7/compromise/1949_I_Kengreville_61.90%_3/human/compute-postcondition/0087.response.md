Postcondition: **After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n`, `nodes` will be an empty list, `c0` will be 0, `c1` will be 0, and `ok` will be `True` if any `visited[i]` is `False` and `c1` is not 0 for those `i`. Otherwise, `ok` will be `False` if `visited[i]` was not `False` or `c1` was 0 for all `i` during the loop iterations.**
