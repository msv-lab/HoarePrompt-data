Output State: **`nodes` must contain at least one element, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `c1` by adding the value of `coef1[j]`, where `j` is the next element in the list `nodes`. The initial conditions of `nodes` containing at least one element and `c0` being increased by `coef0[j]` remain unchanged.
