Output State: **`i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer; `coef0[i]` is 0; `coef1[i]` is 1; `nodes` is an empty list; The function dfs(i) has been called.**

Explanation: The code `dfs(i)` calls the function `dfs` with the argument `i`. However, without the definition of the `dfs` function, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. But we know that the function call itself does not change the values of the existing variables (`i`, `n`, `coef0[i]`, `coef1[i]`, `nodes`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is that the function `dfs(i)` has been invoked.
