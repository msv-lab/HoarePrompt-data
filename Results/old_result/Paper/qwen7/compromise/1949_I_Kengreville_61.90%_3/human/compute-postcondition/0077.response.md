Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `c0` will be increased by the sum of all values in `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` will be increased by the sum of all values in `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`.

This means that `c0` and `c1` will have accumulated the total contributions from `coef0` and `coef1` respectively, as `j` iterates over all elements in `nodes`.
