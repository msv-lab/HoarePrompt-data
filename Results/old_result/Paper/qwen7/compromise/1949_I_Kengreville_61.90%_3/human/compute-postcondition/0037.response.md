Postcondition: `i` is in the range `[0, n-1]`, `n` must be a positive integer. If `visited[i]` is False, then `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True if `ok` was True or `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged. If `visited[i]` is True, the values of `c0`, `c1`, and `ok` remain unchanged.
