Output State: **`c0` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `nodes` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `c0` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `coef0[i]`, `coef1[i]`, or `nodes`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
