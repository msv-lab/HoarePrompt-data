Output State: **`i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer; `coef0[i]` is 0; `coef1[i]` is 1; `nodes` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `nodes`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `coef0[i]`, or `coef1[i]`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values and states.
