Output State: **`c0` is `coef0[j] + coef0[j]`, `c1` is `coef1[j] + coef1[j]`, `j` is the second element in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code `c1 += coef1[j]` increments `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Since `c1` was previously increased by `coef1[j]`, it now becomes `coef1[j] + coef1[j]`. The values of `c0` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
