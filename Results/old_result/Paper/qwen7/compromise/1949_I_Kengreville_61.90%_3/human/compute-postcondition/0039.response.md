Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at `0` and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - `n` must be a positive integer.
   - If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is `True` if `ok` was `True` or `c1` is not equal to `0`, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1 + 1 = n`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `n`.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `i` should be `n`.
   - `n` remains the same (it must still be a positive integer).
   - The values of `c0`, `c1`, and `ok` remain unchanged because the loop condition for the next iteration is based solely on `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be a positive integer**.
