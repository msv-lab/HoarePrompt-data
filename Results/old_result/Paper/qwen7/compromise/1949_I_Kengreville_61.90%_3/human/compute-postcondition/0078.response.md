Output State: **`ok` is `ok or (c1 != 0)`**, **`c0` will be increased by the sum of all values in `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` will be increased by the sum of all values in `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code `ok = ok or c1 != 0` checks if `c1` is not equal to 0. If `c1` is not 0, `ok` is set to `True` (if it was previously `False`) or remains `True` (if it was already `True`). The values of `c0` and `c1` are updated according to their respective accumulation processes as described in the initial state.
