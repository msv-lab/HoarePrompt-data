Output State: **`c0` is `coef0[j+1] + coef0[j+1] + coef0[j]`, `c1` is `coef1[j+1] + coef1[j+1]`, `j` is the third element in `nodes`**.

Explanation: The value of `c0` is updated by adding `coef0[j]` to its current value, which was `coef0[j+1] + coef0[j+1]`. Therefore, the new value of `c0` is `coef0[j+1] + coef0[j+1] + coef0[j]`. The values of `c1` and `j` remain unchanged.
