You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; processing is a list of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of elements in the lists of d; da is an integer key present in the dictionary d; rank is a list of integers with the same length as the number of keys in the dictionary d.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: tmp is 1000000000, d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, da is an integer key present in the dictionary d, rank is a list of integers with the same length as the number of keys in the dictionary d, and the length of d[da] is not equal to 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: Output State: tmp is the minimum value between the initial tmp (1000000000) and the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially 0. For each such `di`, `processing[di - 1]` is temporarily set to 1 during the iteration but reverts back to 0 after the iteration. The `rank` list and the dictionary `d` remain unchanged.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp` incremented by 1, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the initial tmp (1000000000) and the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially 0 and then reverted to 0; `rank[da - 1]` is `tmp + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of elements in the lists of `d`, an integer key `da` present in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the number of keys in the dictionary `d`. It returns 1 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the value of `tmp` incremented by 1, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the initial `tmp` (1000000000) and the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially 0 and then reverted to 0; `rank[da - 1]` is `tmp + 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns the value of `tmp` incremented by 1, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the initial tmp (1000000000) and the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially 0 and then reverted to 0; `rank[da - 1]` is `tmp + 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
