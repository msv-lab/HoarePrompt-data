Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, and substring is guaranteed to appear in string at least once; `indices` is a list containing the index where `substring` first appears in `string`; `index` is the starting position of `substring` in `string`.**

The code `index = string.find(substring)` finds the starting position of `substring` within `string` and assigns this position to the variable `index`. Since `substring` is guaranteed to appear in `string` at least once, `index` will be assigned a specific integer value representing the starting position of `substring`. The `indices` list, which was initially empty, now contains this single index value.
