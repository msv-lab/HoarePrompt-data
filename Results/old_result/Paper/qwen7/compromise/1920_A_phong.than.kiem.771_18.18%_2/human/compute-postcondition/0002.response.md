The only variable in the loop head is the variable `index`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `index`. If `index` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `index` is the starting position of `substring` in `string`. Since `substring` is guaranteed to appear in `string` at least once, `index` cannot be -1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `index`.

However, we need to ensure that the initial state of `index` allows the loop to execute at least once. Given that `substring` is a non-empty string and is guaranteed to appear in `string` at least once, `index` must be a valid index within `string`.

Since the problem does not provide the exact initial value of `index`, we can infer that it is set to the starting position of `substring` in `string`, which is a valid index.

Thus, no adjustments are necessary based on the given information.

State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, and substring is guaranteed to appear in string at least once; `indices` is a list containing the index where `substring` first appears in `string`; `index` is the starting position of `substring` in `string`**
