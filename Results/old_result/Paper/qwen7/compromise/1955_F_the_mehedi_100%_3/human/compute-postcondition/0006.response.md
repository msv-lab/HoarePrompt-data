Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `cnt` is 1, provided that the first three elements of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`) all have odd remainders when divided by 2. If any of these conditions do not hold, `cnt` remains 0.
