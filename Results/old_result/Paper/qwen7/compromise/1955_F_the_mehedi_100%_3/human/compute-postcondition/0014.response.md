Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
   - `cnt` is updated by `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - For each iteration, `x` takes the value of an element from the list `a`.
   - The variable `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is taken from the list `a`, the list `a` itself does not change in size or content during the loop (it just iterates through its elements).
   - The variable `cnt` is updated based on the current value of `x`, but the value of `x` itself is not stored in the loop head; it is just used for the update of `cnt`.

6. **Determine the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop.
   - `a` remains the same list as it was at the start of the loop, but since we are looking at the state before the next iteration, we don't need to specify the exact elements of `a` unless there is a specific requirement.
   - `cnt` is updated by `math.floor(x / 2)`, where `x` is the last element processed in the previous iteration.

Given that `x` is the last element processed in the previous iteration, let's denote this last element as `x_last`. Therefore, the updated `cnt` would be `cnt + math.floor(x_last / 2)`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x_last / 2)`**
