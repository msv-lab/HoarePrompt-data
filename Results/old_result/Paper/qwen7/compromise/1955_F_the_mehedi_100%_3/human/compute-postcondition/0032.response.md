Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range generated by `range(int(input()))`.
   - `int(input())`: This determines the number of iterations the loop will run.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an empty list or has no elements left to iterate over.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 for each iteration the loop runs.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the number of iterations is determined by user input.
   - If the loop has already completed all its iterations (i.e., `a` is empty), then there are no more elements to process, and the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, the state does not change for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition (`int(input())`) dictates the number of iterations, and if it's already run out, it won't run again.

Given this analysis, the state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is an empty list or has no elements left to iterate over; `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 for each iteration the loop runs.**
