Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `x` from the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
   - `cnt` is calculated based on the first three elements of `a`:
     - If the first three elements (`a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`) all have odd remainders when divided by 2, then `cnt = 1 + \text{math.floor}(x / 2)`.
     - Otherwise, `cnt = 0 + \text{math.floor}(x / 2)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `a`, the variable `x` will change with each iteration.
   - The list `a` and the value of `t` do not change within the loop.
   - The variable `cnt` is calculated based on the first three elements of `a` and does not change during the loop execution unless the first three elements change, which is not the case here.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged because it is based on the initial values of the first three elements of `a` and does not depend on the current value of `x`.

6. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `t` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is still a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
   - `cnt` is still based on the initial values of the first three elements of `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is 1 + \(\text{math.floor}(x / 2)\) if the first three elements of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`) all have odd remainders when divided by 2, otherwise `cnt` is 0 + \(\text{math.floor}(x / 2)\)**.
