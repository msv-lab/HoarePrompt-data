Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For each iteration, `x` takes the value of the current element from the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, it is mentioned that `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the current element being processed in the loop, for the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` itself does not change in the loop body (as no operation is specified to modify `a`), so `a` remains the same list as before.
   - The variable `cnt` is updated based on the value of `x`, but since we are focusing on the state at the start of the next iteration, `cnt` is not directly relevant to the loop head adjustment.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `a` must still have at least one element and `x` will be the next element in the list, the state needs to reflect this.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `x` is the next element in the list `a`**.

However, to provide a specific answer in the required format:

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `x` is the next element in the list `a`**.
