Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` which iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `x`**: Since `x` is iterating over the list `a`, the initial value of `x` will be the first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`).

3. **Determine the initial state of `a`**: The list `a` is obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. The postcondition mentions that the first three elements of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`) should have certain properties.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to start executing.

5. **Adjust the state of `cnt`**: The variable `cnt` is initially set to 1 if the first three elements of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`) all have odd remainders when divided by 2. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. This means that the initial values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` must be considered.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must be a non-empty list.
- `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` must either all be odd or not all be odd, depending on the initial value of `cnt`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `a` is a non-empty list, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` must either all be odd or not all be odd, `cnt` is 1 if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is 0**.
