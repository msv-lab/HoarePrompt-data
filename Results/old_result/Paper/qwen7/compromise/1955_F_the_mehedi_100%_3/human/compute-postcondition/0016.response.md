Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in `a`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to \(10^4\). The list `a` retains its original list of integers. The variable `cnt` is updated to be the total sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for every element `x` in the list `a`.
