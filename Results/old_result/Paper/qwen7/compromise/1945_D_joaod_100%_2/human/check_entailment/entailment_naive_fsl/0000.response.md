Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where Kirill needs to swap positions multiple times to achieve the desired position, and it does not correctly accumulate the costs for intermediate swaps.

Consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

However, the program outputs:
```
13
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of intermediate swaps. The program only considers the cost of the last swap and the cost of passing through intermediate positions, but it does not ensure that the minimum cost is achieved by considering all possible sequences of swaps.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible sequences of swaps and keep track of the minimum cost. This requires a more complex dynamic programming approach or a different algorithm to ensure that the minimum cost is calculated correctly.
