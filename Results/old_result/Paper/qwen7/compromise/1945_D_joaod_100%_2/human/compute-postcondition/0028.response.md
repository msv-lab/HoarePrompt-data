Output State: **`total` is 0 + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente`, `pos_final` is `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is set to the maximum float value, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

This means that the variable `total` has been updated to add the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its initial value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
