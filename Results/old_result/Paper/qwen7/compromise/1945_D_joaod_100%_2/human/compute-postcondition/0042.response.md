Output State: **`total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente`, `pos_final` is `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is the maximum float value if the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1]` was originally true and the condition `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1] < custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` is false, otherwise `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1]` if `v - 1 <= pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1] < custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` is true, or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` if the condition is false, `v` is either less than or equal to `pos_final` or greater than `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the `total` variable has been updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, including the conditions related to `best` which depend on the original values and the conditions specified.
