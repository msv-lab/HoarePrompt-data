Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and the value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, but `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. Since `v` is such that `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, the value of `total` becomes `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
