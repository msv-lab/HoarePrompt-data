Postcondition: `total` is 0, `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
