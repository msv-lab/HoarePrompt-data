Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer, and all other variables are not yet defined.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The final value of `total` is determined by the summation of either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration of `v` in the range from `na_frente` to -1, inclusive. The decision for each addition to `total` depends on the conditions specified within the loop. `best` remains unchanged as it is only updated during the first iteration if `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All iterations of the loop have executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` for each iteration, `na_frente` is reduced to 0, `v` is -1, and `best` is the maximum value found during the iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
