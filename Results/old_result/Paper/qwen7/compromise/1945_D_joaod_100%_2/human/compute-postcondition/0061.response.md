Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, assigning the resulting list to `custo_pra_passar_b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
