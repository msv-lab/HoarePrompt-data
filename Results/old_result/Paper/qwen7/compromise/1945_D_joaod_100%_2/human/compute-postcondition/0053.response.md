Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]`, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is unchanged, `pos_final` is unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are unchanged, `best` is the maximum float value if the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 2]` was originally true and the condition `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 2] < custo_pra_passar_b[v - 2]` is false, otherwise `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 2]` if `v - 2 <= pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 2] < custo_pra_passar_b[v - 2]` is true, or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v - 2]` if the condition is false, `v` is either less than or equal to `pos_final` or greater than `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions involving `best` and `v` remain the same as they were before the code execution.
