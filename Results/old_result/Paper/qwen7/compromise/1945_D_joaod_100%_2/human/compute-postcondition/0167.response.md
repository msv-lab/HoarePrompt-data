Output State: **`total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `best` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final`, or to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `v > pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for updating `best` remains the same, but now it uses the new value of `total` in the calculation.
