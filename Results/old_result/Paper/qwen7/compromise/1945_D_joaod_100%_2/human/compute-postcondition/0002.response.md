Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0; `c` is 0; `na_frente` is an input integer; `pos_final` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The values of `cases` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, `cases` must still be greater than 0, and `c` remains 0. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are the integers input by the user.
