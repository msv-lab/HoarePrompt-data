Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `c`, which ranges over `cases`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `c` is less than `cases`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: The problem states that all iterations of the loop have executed. This means that the loop has completed its execution, and `c` is equal to `cases`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since all iterations have already executed, the loop cannot continue because `c` is no longer less than `cases`. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time.

Given this analysis, the state remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **All iterations of the loop have executed.**
