Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `v` is initialized to `na_frente` and decremented by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will start as long as `v` is within the range `[na_frente, -1]`.
   - Therefore, `v` should be set to `na_frente` initially.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - `total` is already given as `0`.
   - `na_frente` should be set to its initial value (which is not provided but is necessary for the loop to start).
   - `pos_final` is not used in the loop and does not need adjustment.
   - `best` is the maximum float value and does not need adjustment.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers and do not need adjustment since they are not used in the loop initialization.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `na_frente` must be set to its initial value.
- `v` should be set to `na_frente` to start the loop.

Since the initial value of `na_frente` is not provided, we assume it is a valid starting point for the loop.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` is its initial value, `v` is `na_frente`**
