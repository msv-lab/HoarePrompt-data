Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `v` is an integer such that `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to `total`. Since `v` is an integer such that `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and is within the bounds of both lists, `total` is updated to be the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
