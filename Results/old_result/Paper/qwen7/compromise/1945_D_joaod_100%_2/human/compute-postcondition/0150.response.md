Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `v`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `v` starts at `na_frente` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on which is smaller.
   - `na_frente` remains its initial value.
   - `v` is equal to `na_frente` at the start of the loop.
   - `best` is updated to the maximum of the two possible values: `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
   - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is reset to 0, `best` is unchanged, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `v` decreases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `v` will be `na_frente - 1`.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged.
   - `pos_final` remains unchanged.
   - `total` will be updated based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for the new value of `v`.
   - `best` remains unchanged if `v` is not greater than `pos_final`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `v` will be `na_frente - 1`.
- `na_frente` remains unchanged.
- `pos_final` remains unchanged.
- `total` will be updated based on the comparison for the new value of `v`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is either `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`, depending on which is smaller, `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, and `best` is unchanged.**
