Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `best` is unchanged if neither branch updates it, otherwise `best` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final`, or to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `v > pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition for updating `best` based on the value of `v` relative to `pos_final` remains the same.
