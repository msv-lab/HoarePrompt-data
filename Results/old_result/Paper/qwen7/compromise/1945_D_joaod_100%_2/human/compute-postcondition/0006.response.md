Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0; `c` is 0; `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1; `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pos_final` is updated to `pos_final - 1`.
