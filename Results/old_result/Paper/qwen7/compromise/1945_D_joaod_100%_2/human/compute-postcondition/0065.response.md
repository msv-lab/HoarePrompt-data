Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer decreased by 1, `total` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `best = sys.float_info.max` sets the variable `best` to the maximum floating-point value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
