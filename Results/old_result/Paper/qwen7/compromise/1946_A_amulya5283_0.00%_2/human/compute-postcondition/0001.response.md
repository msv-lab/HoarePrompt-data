Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: 
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter, which starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` should start from 0.
- `t` must be greater than 0 (since `t` is a positive integer).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
