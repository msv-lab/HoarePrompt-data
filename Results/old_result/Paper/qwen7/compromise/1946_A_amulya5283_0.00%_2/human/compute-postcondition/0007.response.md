Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a heap in-place. A heap is a binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes (min-heap). The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged. The only change is that `heap` is now a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`.
