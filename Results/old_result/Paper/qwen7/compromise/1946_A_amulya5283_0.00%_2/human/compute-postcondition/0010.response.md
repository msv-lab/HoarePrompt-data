Output State: **`operations` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`, `heap[0]` is now the smallest element popped from the heap, and `smallest` is the smallest element popped from the heap.**

This means that the smallest element from the heap has been removed (heappopped), and it is stored in the variable `smallest`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
