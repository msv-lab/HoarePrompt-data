Output State: **`heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`, `current_median` is unchanged, `smallest` is the value that was at `heap[0]` before popping.**

Explanation: The code pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the heap using `heapq.heappush`. This means the smallest element in the heap (which was `smallest` before) has been incremented by 1 and is now at the root of the heap (`heap[0]`). The value of `current_median` remains unchanged, and `smallest` still holds the value it had before the pop operation.
