Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `heap = arr[median_index:]` creates a new list `heap` which contains all elements of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end of the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
