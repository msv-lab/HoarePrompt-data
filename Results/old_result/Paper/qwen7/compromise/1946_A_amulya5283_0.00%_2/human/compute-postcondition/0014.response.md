Output State: **`operations` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`, `heap[0]` is now the smallest element popped from the heap, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from the heap, `heap` has the smallest element (which was previously `heap[0]`) pushed back with a value of `smallest + 1`, `smallest + 1` is less than or equal to `current_median`, `smallest` is the previous smallest element popped from the heap.**

This output state reflects that the `smallest` element has been popped from the heap, and the heap has been updated by pushing back the new smallest element which is `smallest + 1`. All other variables retain their initial states except for `heap[0]` and `smallest`.
