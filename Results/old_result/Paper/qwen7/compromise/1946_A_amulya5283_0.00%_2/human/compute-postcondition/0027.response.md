The code `median_index = n // 2` simply reassigns the value of `median_index` to be the same as `n // 2`. Since `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, and `test_cases[1]` is not further specified, we keep `n` as is. The value of `median_index` remains unchanged from its previous value, which is `n // 2`.

All other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 2`, `smallest` is decreased by 1.**
