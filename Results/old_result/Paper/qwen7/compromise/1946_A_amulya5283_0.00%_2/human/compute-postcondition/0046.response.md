Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times, `results` is [3]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `operations` (which is 3) to the list `results`. Since `operations` was already 3, appending it to `results` does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged as no operation directly modifies them in this snippet.
