Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and `answers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `answers`. The values of `trumps`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `trumps` is still an empty list, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 16 inclusive, and `answers` is now an empty list.
