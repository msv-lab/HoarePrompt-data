Output State: **`a` is case['array'], `mod_x` is num % x, `mod_y` is num % y, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is num % y**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This means that `required_mod_y` now holds the same value as `mod_y`. The other variables (`a`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
