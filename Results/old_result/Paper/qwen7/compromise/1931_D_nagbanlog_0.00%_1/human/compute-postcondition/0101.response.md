Output State: **`results` contains the value of `beautiful_count`, `case` is updated to `case['params']` containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `test_cases` must have more elements to process, `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`.**

In this step, the code assigns `case['array']` to the variable `a`. The values of `results`, `case`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `a` now holds the value of `case['array']`.
