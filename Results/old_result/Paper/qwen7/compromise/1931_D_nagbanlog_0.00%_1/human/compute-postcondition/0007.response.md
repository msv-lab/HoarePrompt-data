Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in a:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is initially set to `case['array']`.
   - `num` is a variable that will take on each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `a`. Once `a` becomes empty, the loop will terminate.

4. **Initial state of other variables**:
   - `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.

5. **Adjust the states needed for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop depends on the elements of `a`, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `num` will take on the values from `a` during each iteration, but its initial value is not specified and does not affect the loop's ability to start.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
