Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `beautiful_count` is incremented by the number of times the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` appears in `freq` for each iteration.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder of the last `num` divided by `y`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder of the last `num` divided by `x`.
   - `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
   - The tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is present in `freq` with a frequency equal to the number of times it appeared during the loop iterations.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')`.

Given the initial state, the `beautiful_count` is incremented by the number of times the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` appears in `freq`. Since the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is present in `freq` with a frequency equal to the number of times it appeared during the loop iterations, `beautiful_count` will be set to this frequency.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the frequency of the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq]**
