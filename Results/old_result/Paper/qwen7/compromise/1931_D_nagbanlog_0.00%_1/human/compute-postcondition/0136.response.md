Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mod_x` to the value of `num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
