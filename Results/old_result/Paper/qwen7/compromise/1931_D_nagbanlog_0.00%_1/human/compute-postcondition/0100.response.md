Output State: **`results` contains the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the sum of all values in `freq` where the key matches `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`, `case` is updated to `case['params']` containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, and `test_cases` must have more elements to process.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = case['params']` unpacks the dictionary `case['params']` into three variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The `case` variable now holds these three values. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
