Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `num` from the list `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
   - `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
   - `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. Therefore, the only variables that change within the loop are `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` will be `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` will be `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` will be `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` will be `mod_y`.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - Since `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, it will remain the same for the next iteration.
   - `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
   - `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` will be the remainder when the next element in `a` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` will be the remainder when the next element in `a` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` will be `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` will be `mod_y`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**
