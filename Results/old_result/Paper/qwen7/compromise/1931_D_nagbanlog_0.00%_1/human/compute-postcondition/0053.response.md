Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is a list containing 0, `mod_y` is the remainder of the last `num` (from the new `case`) divided by `y`, `mod_x` is the remainder of the last `num` (from the new `case`) divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`, `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `beautiful_count` to 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
- The value of `beautiful_count` is now explicitly set to 0.
- The value of `mod_y` and `mod_x` are defined based on the last `num` from the new `case`.
- `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are also defined based on the values of `x` and `num`.
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned from `case['params']`.
- The value of `a` is assigned from `case['array']`.
- `freq` remains an empty dictionary.
