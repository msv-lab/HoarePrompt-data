Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is the sum of all values in `freq` where the key matches `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`.
- `freq` contains counts of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a`.

The `print` statement outputs a formatted string with `beautiful_count`.

To break it down further:
- `beautiful_count` is derived from the `freq` dictionary, specifically summing up the values of all keys that match `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`.
- `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times this tuple appears in the array `a`.

Therefore, the output will be a string indicating the count of beautiful pairs, where a "beautiful pair" is defined by the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where [beautiful_count] is the sum of all values in `freq` where the key matches `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`)**
