Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num` which is taken from the array `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` is an array.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `beautiful_count` is unchanged unless `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `num` in the array `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `num` will be the next element in the array `a`.
   - `mod_x` will be `num % x` for the new `num`.
   - `mod_y` will be `num % y` for the new `num`.
   - `required_mod_x` will be `(x - mod_x) % x` for the new `mod_x`.
   - `required_mod_y` will be `num % y` for the new `num`.

5. **State adjustments**:
   - Since `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `mod_x` and `mod_y` will change based on the new `num`.
   - `a` remains the same array.
   - `beautiful_count` will remain unchanged unless `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, but since we don't know the exact value of `num` yet, we cannot determine if `beautiful_count` will change or not.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` based on the new `num`.

**State:**
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1 (this will be true for the new `mod_x` and `mod_y`).
- `a` is an array.
- `mod_x` is `num % x` for the new `num`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y` for the new `num`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x` for the new `mod_x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `num % y` for the new `num`.
- `beautiful_count` is unchanged unless `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.

Since we don't know the exact value of `num` for the next iteration, we express it in terms of the new `mod_x` and `mod_y`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `a` is an array, `mod_x` is `num % x` for the new `num`, `mod_y` is `num % y` for the new `num`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x` for the new `mod_x`, `required_mod_y` is `num % y` for the new `num`, `beautiful_count` is unchanged unless `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**
