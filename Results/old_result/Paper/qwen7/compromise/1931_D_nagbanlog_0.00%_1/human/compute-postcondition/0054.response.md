Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing 0.
- `mod_y` is the remainder of the last `num` (from the new `case`) divided by `y`.
- `mod_x` is the remainder of the last `num` (from the new `case`) divided by `x`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`.
- `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` since these are the parameters being processed in the test case.

Given that `n`, `x`, and `y` are derived from `case['params']` and `a` is derived from `case['array']`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]** (where `[n]`, `[x]`, `[y]`, and `[a]` are the respective values from `case['params']` and `case['array']`).
