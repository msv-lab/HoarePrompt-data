Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` does not change any values but simply reassigns `required_mod_y` to be equal to `mod_y`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
