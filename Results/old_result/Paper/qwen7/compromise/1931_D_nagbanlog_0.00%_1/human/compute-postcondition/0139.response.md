Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

This means that the value of `required_mod_y` has been updated to be the same as `mod_y`, while all other variables remain in their previously described states.
