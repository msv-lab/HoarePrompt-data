Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by the number of times the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` appears in `freq` for each iteration; `results` is a list containing the current value of `beautiful_count`; `mod_y` is the remainder of the last `num` divided by `y`; `mod_x` is the remainder of the last `num` divided by `x`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(beautiful_count)` appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the list `results`. This does not change the value of `beautiful_count` itself, nor does it affect the values of `mod_y`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, or `required_mod_y`. The tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is still present in `freq` with a frequency equal to the number of times it appeared during the loop iterations.
