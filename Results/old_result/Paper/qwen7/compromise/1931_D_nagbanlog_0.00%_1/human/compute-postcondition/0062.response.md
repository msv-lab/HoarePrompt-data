Output State: **`beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `a` is an array, `mod_x` is num % x, `mod_y` is num % y, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is num % y.**

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the frequency value corresponding to the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` from the `freq` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
