The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It processes each test case to count the number of "beautiful pairs" based on certain conditions involving the modulo operations of the elements in the list `a` with `x` and `y`. A "beautiful pair" is defined by specific modulo requirements. After processing all test cases, it returns a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
