Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing the parameters and arrays for each test case).
   - This part is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - It also initializes a variable `beautiful_count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Modulo Calculations**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` using the modulo operation with `x` and `y` respectively.
   - It then calculates the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` values to form a beautiful pair.
   - This step is correct and follows the problem statement.

4. **Frequency Dictionary Update**:
   - If the `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair is already in the `freq` dictionary, it adds the corresponding value from `freq` to `beautiful_count`.
   - If the `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair is not in `freq`, it initializes it to 0.
   - It then increments the count of the `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair in the `freq` dictionary.
   - These steps ensure that we correctly count the number of beautiful pairs.

5. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing each test case, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

### Correctness Check

The logic in the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It uses a frequency dictionary to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs based on the conditions given in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the program, it seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
