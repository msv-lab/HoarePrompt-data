None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) which is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\), and allows asking up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
