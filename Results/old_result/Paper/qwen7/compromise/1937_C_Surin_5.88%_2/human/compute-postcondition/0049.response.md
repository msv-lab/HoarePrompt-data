Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i`, and `i` is now equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Initially, `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, after executing this line, `prev` will hold the value of `i`, which is `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
