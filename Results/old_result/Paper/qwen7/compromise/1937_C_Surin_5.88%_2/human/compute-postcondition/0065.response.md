Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `kp` is 1, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1 and the current value of `r` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 1) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
