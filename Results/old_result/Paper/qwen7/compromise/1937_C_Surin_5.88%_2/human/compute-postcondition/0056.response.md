Output State: **`n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, `prev` is equal to `n`, and `i` is set to `n`, `kp` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The conditions that `n` must be at least 2 and that `int(input())` must be at least 2 are preserved. The other variables (`r`, `prev`, `i`, and `kp`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
