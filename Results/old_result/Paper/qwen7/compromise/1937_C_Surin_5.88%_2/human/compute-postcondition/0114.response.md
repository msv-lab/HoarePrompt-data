Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will start from 1 and increment until it reaches `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0

We need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `g` remains 0 (it is not involved in the loop condition)
- `v1` remains 0 (it is not involved in the loop condition)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1

So, the final state should be:

State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
