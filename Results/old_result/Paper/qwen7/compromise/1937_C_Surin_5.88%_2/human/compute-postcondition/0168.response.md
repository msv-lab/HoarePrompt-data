Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, and the code `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written out to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
