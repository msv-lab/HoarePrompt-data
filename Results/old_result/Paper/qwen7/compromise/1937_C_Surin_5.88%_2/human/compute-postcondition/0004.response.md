Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer that is at least 1, `g` is 0.**

The code initializes `g` to 0. Since `kp` and `n` were unaffected by the code, their initial states remain the same. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `g` and retains the initial states of `kp` and `n`.
