Output State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is an input string from the user.**

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `r`. The values of `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately but does not affect the variables.
