Based on the initial state provided:

- `g` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer which is at least 2.
- `r` is the final input string after all iterations (though this is not relevant to the print statement).
- `prev` is `n-1`.
- `i` is 0.
- `kp` is 1.
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

Here, `prev` is explicitly defined as `n-1`, and `v1` is also explicitly defined as `n-1`. Therefore, both `prev` and `v1` will have the same value, which is `n-1`.

Output: **! n-1 n-1**
