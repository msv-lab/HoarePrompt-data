Based on the initial state provided:

- `v2` is equal to `i`.
- `i` retains its original value.

Let's break down the print statement:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know that `v2 = i`. However, the value of `v1` is not specified. Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, it will remain as `v1` in the print statement.

Given this, the print statement will output:

Output: **? v1 v1 i i**
