Output State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `v2` is `i`, and `v1` is equal to the input string `r` if `r` is equal to '<'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. The initial values of `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The condition for `v1` being equal to the input string `r` if `r` is equal to '<' also remains valid.
