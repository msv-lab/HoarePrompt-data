Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the given code snippet.
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v2` is equal to `i`.
   - `r` is the string input by the user.

4. **Consider the loop body logic**:
   - If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to `v2`.
   - Otherwise, the values of `v1`, `v2`, and `r` remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than its value in the current iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `v2` will be updated to the new value of `i`.
   - `r` remains unchanged unless it was set to '<' during the loop body execution.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the start of the next iteration:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the start of the previous iteration).
- After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` becomes `k + 1`.
- `v2` is now equal to `i + 1` because `v2` is updated to `i` at the end of each iteration.
- `r` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`v2` is equal to `i + 1`, `r` is the string input by the user**.
