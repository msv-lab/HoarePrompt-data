Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `r` is the string '>', `prev` is equal to `i`, and `i` is `n`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

Explanation: The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change any variable values but ensures that all previously printed output is flushed (sent to the console). Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is the flushing of the output buffer.
