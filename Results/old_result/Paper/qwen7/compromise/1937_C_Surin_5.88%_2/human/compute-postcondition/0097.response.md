Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string, `prev` is `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to be equal to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `i` is less than `n` is still valid, and the other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
