Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the final input string after all iterations, `prev` is `n-1`, `i` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `g` remains 0 as it was not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `r` is the final input string received after all iterations of the loop.
- `prev` is set to `n-1` because the loop updates `prev` to the current value of `i` in each iteration, and eventually `i` reaches `n-1`.
- `i` becomes 0 after the loop completes all iterations since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- `kp` remains 1 as it was not modified within the loop.
- `v1` and `v2` both remain `n-1` as they were not altered within the loop.
