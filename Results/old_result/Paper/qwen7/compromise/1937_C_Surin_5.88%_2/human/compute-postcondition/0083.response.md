Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the final input string after all iterations, `prev` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. Since the loop updates `v1` to `v2` whenever the input string `r` is '<', and assuming the user inputs '<' every time (which is the only condition that changes `v1`), `v1` and `v2` will both end up being `n-1`. The other variables (`g`, `prev`, `kp`, `i`, and `r`) retain their final values as determined by the loop's execution.
