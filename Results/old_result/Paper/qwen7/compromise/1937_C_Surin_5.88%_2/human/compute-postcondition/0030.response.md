Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations (which is `n-1`), `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`. The value of `r` will be '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and `v2` will also be `n-1`. The value of `r` will be '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, meaning `v1` will take the value of `v2` in each iteration, resulting in `v1` being `n-1` as well. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be at least 1.
