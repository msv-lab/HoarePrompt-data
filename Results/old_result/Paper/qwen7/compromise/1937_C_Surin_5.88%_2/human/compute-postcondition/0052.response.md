Output State: `n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i`, and `i` is now equal to `n`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` must still be at least 2. The variable `r` will be the input received from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `prev` will be equal to the final value of `i`, which is `n`. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, and it is no longer being modified by the loop since all iterations have completed.
