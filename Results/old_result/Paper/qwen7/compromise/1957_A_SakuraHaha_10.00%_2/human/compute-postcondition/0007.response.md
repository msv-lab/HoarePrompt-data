Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which iterates over `cnt.values()`. Therefore, the only variable directly involved in the loop head is `x`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `x`**: Since `x` is iterating over the values of the dictionary `cnt`, the initial state of `x` can be any value present in `cnt.values()`. However, since we need to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `cnt.values()` is not empty.

3. **Ensure `cnt.values()` is Not Empty**: For the loop to execute at least once, `cnt.values()` must contain at least one value. This means that `cnt` must have at least one key-value pair.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the state of `cnt` to ensure it has at least one key-value pair. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `cnt` has at least one key-value pair.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, and `cnt` must have at least one key-value pair**.
