Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the movement logic specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program only counts coins and does not account for the ability to move two cells forward if the middle cell is empty. For example, consider the input:

```
10
.@@*.*@@.**
```

In this case, starting from the leftmost cell, the correct sequence of moves would be:
1. Move to the second cell (coin collected).
2. Move to the fourth cell (coin collected).
3. Move to the sixth cell (coin collected).

However, the program will only count the first coin and stop, as it does not allow moving two cells forward when the middle cell is empty. This results in missing coins and thus an incorrect count.
