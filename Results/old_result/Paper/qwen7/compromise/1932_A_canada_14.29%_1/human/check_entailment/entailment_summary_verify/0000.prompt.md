You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
During your journey through computer universes, you stumbled upon a very
interesting world. It is a path with n consecutive cells, each of which can
either be empty, contain thorns, or a coin. In one move, you can move one or
two cells along the path, provided that the destination cell does not contain
thorns (and belongs to the path). If you move to the cell with a coin, you
pick it up.

Here, green arrows correspond to legal moves, and the red arrow corresponds to
an illegal move.

You want to collect as many coins as possible. Find the maximum number of
coins you can collect in the discovered world if you start in the leftmost
cell of the path.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the length of the path.

The second line of each test case contains a string of n characters, the
description of the path. The character '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes
a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. It is guaranteed that
the first cell is empty.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer, the maximum number of coins you
can collect.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10
    
    .@@*@.**@@
    
    5
    
    .@@@@
    
    15
    
    .@@..@***..@@@*

Output

    3
    4
    3

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        len = int(input())
        s = list(input())
        ret = 0
        thorn = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == '@':
                thorn = 0
                ret += 1
            elif i == '*':
                thorn += 1
                if thorn == 2:
                    break
            else:
                thorn == 0
        print(ret)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a string of length n containing '.', '@', and '*'. It counts the number of '@' characters in each string, breaking early if two '*' characters are encountered consecutively. After processing all test cases, it prints the count of '@' characters for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the movement logic specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program only counts coins and does not account for the ability to move two cells forward if the middle cell is empty. For example, consider the input:

```
10
.@@*.*@@.**
```

In this case, starting from the leftmost cell, the correct sequence of moves would be:
1. Move to the second cell (coin collected).
2. Move to the fourth cell (coin collected).
3. Move to the sixth cell (coin collected).

However, the program will only count the first coin and stop, as it does not allow moving two cells forward when the middle cell is empty. This results in missing coins and thus an incorrect count.
