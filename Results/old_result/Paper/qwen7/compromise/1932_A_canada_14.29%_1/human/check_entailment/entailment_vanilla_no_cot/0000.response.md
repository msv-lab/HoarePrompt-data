Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Variable Name Conflict**: The variable `len` shadows the built-in Python function `len`. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. **Logic for Thorns**: The logic for handling thorns is incorrect. The program should check if the next two cells are thorns before deciding whether to move or not. The current implementation does not properly handle this.
3. **Break Condition**: The `break` statement is used incorrectly. It should only be used when two consecutive thorns are encountered, but the current implementation breaks out of the loop too early.
4. **Movement Logic**: The program does not correctly simulate the movement of one or two cells at a time while picking up coins.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())  # Use 'n' instead of 'len'
        s = list(input())
        ret = 0
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if s[i] == '*':  # Skip thorns
                i += 2
                continue
            elif s[i] == '@':  # Pick up coin
                ret += 1
                i += 2
            else:  # Move to next cell
                i += 1
        print(ret)

func()
```

This corrected program properly handles the movement and coin collection logic according to the problem description.
