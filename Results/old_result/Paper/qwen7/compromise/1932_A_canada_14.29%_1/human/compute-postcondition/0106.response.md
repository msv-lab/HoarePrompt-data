Output State: **`s` is a list of characters entered by the user, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `len` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The line `thorn = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `thorn`. This overrides the previous value of `thorn`, which was the cumulative count of '*' characters encountered without encountering another '*'. All other variables remain unchanged.
