Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `s` is a non-empty list of characters.
- `i` is the first character in the list `s`.
- The value of `i` determines the following:
  - If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 1 and `ret` is 1.
  - If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
  - If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 0.

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each character in the list `s`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first character in the list `s`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop iterates over each character in the list `s`, the next value of `i` will be the second character in the list `s`.
3. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will now be the second character in the list `s`.
   - The value of `thorn` and `ret` will depend on the new value of `i`.

### Conclusion
Since the loop is iterating through the list `s`, the next value of `i` will be the second character in the list. Therefore, we need to update the state accordingly.

### Final State
- `i` will be the second character in the list `s`.
- The values of `thorn` and `ret` will depend on the new value of `i`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is the second character in the list `s`, `thorn` and `ret` will depend on the value of `i`**.
