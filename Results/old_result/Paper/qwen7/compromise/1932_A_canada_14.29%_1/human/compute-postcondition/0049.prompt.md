Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character, `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether the character `i` is not '*', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether the character `i` is not '*', and `thorn` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '*', otherwise `thorn` remains 0. If `i` is '@', `ret` is incremented by 1 and `thorn` is set to 0. If `i` is not '@', `ret` remains unchanged and `thorn` is incremented by 1 if it is not already 2, otherwise it remains 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on whether the character `i` is '*', '@', or neither, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
