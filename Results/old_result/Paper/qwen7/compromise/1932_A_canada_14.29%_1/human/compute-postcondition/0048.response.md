Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on whether the character `i` is '*', '@', or neither, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
