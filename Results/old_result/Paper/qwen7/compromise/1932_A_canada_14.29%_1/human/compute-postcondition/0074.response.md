Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is a character from the list, `thorn` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is '@', `thorn` remains 0 and `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is either 1 (and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `thorn` equals 2) or 0. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` remains 0.
