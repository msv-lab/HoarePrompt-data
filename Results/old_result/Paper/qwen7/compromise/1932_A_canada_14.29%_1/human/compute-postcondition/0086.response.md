Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the list `s` to iterate over.
   - The variable `i` is the current character being processed.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `i` is the next character in the list.
   - `thorn` is either 2, 1, or 0, based on the value of `i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are more characters in `s`, the list `s` must have at least two characters for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `i` will be the second character in the updated list `s`.
   - `thorn` will be adjusted based on the value of `i`:
     - If `i` is '@', `thorn` becomes 0.
     - If `i` is '*', `thorn` becomes either 2 or 1 depending on its original value (0 or 1).
     - If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` becomes 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `s` must have at least two characters.
- `i` will be the second character in `s`.
- `thorn` will be adjusted based on the value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `i` is the second character in the list, and `thorn` is adjusted based on the value of `i`.**
