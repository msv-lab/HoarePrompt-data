Output State: **`s` is a list of characters entered by the user, `ret` is the total count of '@' characters encountered in the list `s`, `thorn` is the cumulative count of '*' characters encountered without encountering another '*', `len` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it into a list of characters. This list is assigned to the variable `s`. The variables `ret`, `thorn`, and `len` remain unchanged from their initial states.
