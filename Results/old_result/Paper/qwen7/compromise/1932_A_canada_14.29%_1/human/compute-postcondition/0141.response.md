Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the list `s`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the second character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', and 1 if `i` is '*'.
   - `ret` is 1 if `i` is '*', and `ret` is either `i` + 1 if `i` is '*' and `thorn` equals 2, or `ret` remains 0 if `i` is not '*'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` will be updated based on the value of `i` (whether it is '*' or not).
   - `ret` will be updated based on the value of `i` and the current value of `thorn`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be the third character in the list `s` (since it was the second character before and the loop will move to the next character).
- `thorn` will be 0 if the third character is not '*', and 1 if it is '*'.
- `ret` will be updated based on the new values of `i` and `thorn`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is the third character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', and `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', and `ret` is updated accordingly**.

To be more specific about `ret`:
- If the third character is '*', `thorn` will be 1.
- If the third character is not '*', `thorn` will be 0.
- If the third character is '*', `ret` will be 1 if `thorn` is 2, otherwise it remains 0.
- If the third character is not '*', `ret` remains 0.

However, since the exact value of `ret` depends on the previous value of `thorn`, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`i` is the third character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', and `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', and `ret` is updated accordingly**.

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is the third character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', and `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', and `ret` is updated accordingly**.
