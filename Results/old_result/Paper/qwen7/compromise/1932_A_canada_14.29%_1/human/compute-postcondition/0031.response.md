Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether the character `i` is not '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
