Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `len = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `len`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
