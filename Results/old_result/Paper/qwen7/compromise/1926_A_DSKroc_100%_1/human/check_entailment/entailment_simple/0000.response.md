Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.
3. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', and 'B' otherwise.
5. The program handles multiple test cases as specified and ensures distinct strings for each test case.
6. The provided comments accurately describe the state transitions and the logic of the program.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` matches the requirements and produces the correct output based on the input provided.

Correctness: **True**
