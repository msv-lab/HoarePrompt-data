Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `i` holds the current character from the string `s`.

3. **Determine the next state**: Since the loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`, the next character in the string `s` will be processed in the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be set to the next character in `s`.

4. **Check the postcondition**: The postcondition given is that if the character `i` is 'A', then `ac` is set to 1 and `bc` is set to 0. Otherwise, `ac` is set to 0 and `bc` is set to 1. This means the values of `ac` and `bc` depend on the value of `i`.

5. **Adjust the states**: We need to adjust the state such that `i` is now the next character in the string `s`, and `ac` and `bc` are updated based on the value of `i`.

Given the postcondition and the loop behavior, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is the next character in the string `s`.
- `ac` and `bc` are updated based on the value of `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can represent it as the next character in the string `s`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 0, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is either 1 or 0, and `s` is a non-empty input string. `i` is the next character in the string `s`, and `ac` and `bc` are updated based on the value of `i`.**
