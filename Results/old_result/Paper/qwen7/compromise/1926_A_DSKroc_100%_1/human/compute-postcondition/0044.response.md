Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive.
   - `q` is 1.
   - `ac` is either 1 or 0.
   - `bc` is either 1 or 0.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.

3. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string, it must have at least one character remaining for the loop to execute again.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the next character in the string `s`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `q` remains 1 because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `ac` and `bc` remain either 1 or 0 because they are not directly affected by the loop.
   - `s` must now be the string `s` with the first character removed (since `i` is the current character being processed).

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 1, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is either 1 or 0, and `s` is a non-empty string with the first character removed.**
