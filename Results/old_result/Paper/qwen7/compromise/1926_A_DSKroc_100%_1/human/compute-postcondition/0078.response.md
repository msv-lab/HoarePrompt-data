Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the second character of `s`.
   - `ac` is 2 if the first character of `s` is 'A', otherwise `bc` is 2.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using `for i in s`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The loop variable `i` is set to the current character being processed in each iteration.
   - The variable `i` at the start of the loop is the second character of `s`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the third character of `s`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `s` must still be a non-empty string.

4. **Updating the States:**
   - `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop is iterating through its characters but does not modify `s` itself.
   - `i` moves to the next character in the string `s`, which is the third character.
   - The values of `ac` and `bc` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, these values stay the same.

5. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - `s` is still a non-empty string.
   - `i` is now the third character of `s`.
   - `ac` is still 2 if the first character of `s` is 'A', otherwise `bc` is still 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character of `s`, `ac` is 2 if the first character of `s` is 'A', otherwise `bc` is 2**.
