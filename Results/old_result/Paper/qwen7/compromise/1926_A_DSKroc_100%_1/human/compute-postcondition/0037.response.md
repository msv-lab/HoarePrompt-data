Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the variable that will iterate over each character in the string `s`.
   - `s` is the string input by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `s` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will take on the value of each character in `s`, we don't need to specify its initial value; it will be set during the loop iterations.
   - We need to ensure that `s` is not empty for the loop to start executing.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `s` must be a non-empty string.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 1, `ac` is 0, `bc` is 0, and `s` is a non-empty string**.
