Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 1, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is 2 (since it was incremented by 1), and `s` is a non-empty string with the first character removed.**

The value of `bc` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
