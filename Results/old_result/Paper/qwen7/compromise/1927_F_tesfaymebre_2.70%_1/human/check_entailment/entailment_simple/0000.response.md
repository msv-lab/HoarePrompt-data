Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input according to the problem statement.
2. It uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to manage connected components and track the minimum edge weight within each component.
3. The program sorts the edges in descending order of their weights and processes them in this order. When an edge connects two nodes in the same component, it updates the minimum edge weight and records the nodes involved in this edge.
4. If an edge connects two nodes in different components, it performs a union operation to merge these components.
5. After processing all edges, it finds the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in a cycle with this edge weight.
6. It then performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes in the cycle to find the actual cycle and prints the result.
7. The code handles multiple test cases and ensures that the constraints are respected.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. The provided annotations and the flow of the program suggest that it should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
