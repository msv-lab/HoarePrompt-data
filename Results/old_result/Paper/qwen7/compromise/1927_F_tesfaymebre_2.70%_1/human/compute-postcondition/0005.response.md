Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m`, where `3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ \min(\lfloor n \cdot (n - 1)/2 \rfloor, 2 \cdot 10^5)`, and `m` represents the number of edges. Each edge is represented by three integers `u`, `v`, and `w`, where `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`, `u ≠ v`, and `1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6`. The graph is guaranteed to have at least one simple cycle, and the sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs information about the graph based on the given parameters. The final state of the program is that `test_cases` is set to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.**
