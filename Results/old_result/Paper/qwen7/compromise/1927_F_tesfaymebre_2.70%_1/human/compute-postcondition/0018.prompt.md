You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n*(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and DSU is a disjoint set union data structure initialized with n+1 elements.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the return value of `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict where each key has a list of values representing connected nodes, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a weight and a pair of connected nodes. After executing the loop, `graph` will contain edges between nodes based on the values returned by `func_3()` for each iteration, and `edges` will contain the weights and corresponding node pairs for all iterations.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: `node_u` is a node index, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among the connected components formed during the process, `dsu` is a DSU object with updated find and union operations based on the edges processed, `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the return value of `func_3()`, `graph` remains unchanged, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a weight and a pair of connected nodes (sorted in descending order by weight), `node_v` is a node index.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: nodes visited during DFS from node_u excluding its parent (where nodes are the nodes visited in the DFS traversal excluding the parent of node_u)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses predefined variables (n, m, edges, DSU) where (n, m) are integers with specific constraints, edges is a list of tuples representing edges in a graph, and DSU is a disjoint set union data structure. The function performs operations based on these inputs and returns a result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
