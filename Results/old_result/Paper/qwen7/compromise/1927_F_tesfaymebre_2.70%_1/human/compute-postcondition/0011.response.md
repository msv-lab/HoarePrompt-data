The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, and `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being traversed. 

- If the function returns the list `path`, it means the function is returning the current path of vertices being traversed during the DFS traversal.
- If the function returns an empty list, it indicates that a specific condition was met, possibly indicating the end of a branch or a certain state in the DFS traversal.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `dfs` is to accept an integer `curr` (representing the current vertex), an integer `parent` (representing the parent vertex), and a list `path` (representing the current path of vertices). It returns the current path of vertices being traversed during the DFS traversal or an empty list under certain conditions.
