Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases after calling `func_1()`.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the return value of `func_1()` to `test_cases`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `test_cases`. However, we know that `test_cases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases after the function call. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
