Output State: **`res` is the result of the DFS starting from `node_u` excluding the parent node, `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among the connected components formed during the process, `dsu` is a DSU object with updated find and union operations based on the edges processed, `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the return value of `func_3()`, `graph` remains unchanged, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a weight and a pair of connected nodes (sorted in descending order by weight), `node_v` is a node index.**

Explanation: The function `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` performs a depth-first search starting from `node_u` and excluding its parent node (-1). This function call updates the `res` variable with the result of the DFS traversal. The other variables remain unchanged as the DFS does not directly modify them.
