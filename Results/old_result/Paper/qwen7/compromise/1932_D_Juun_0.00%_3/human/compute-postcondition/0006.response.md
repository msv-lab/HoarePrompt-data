Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings), `answers` is a list of strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None. After the loop, for each card input, if the suit matches the trump suit, the rank is appended to the `trumps` list. If the suit has already been seen before and its rank is not None, a new answer string is created and added to the `answers` list, and the rank for that suit in the `suits` dictionary is set to None. Otherwise, the rank for that suit in the `suits` dictionary is updated to the current rank.
