Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases where the string contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Specifically, the program counts the occurrences of "map" and removes them but does not check for and remove occurrences of "pie". For example, consider the input string "pie". The program would not detect this as needing any deletions, but according to the problem description, it should require 3 deletions to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for this case.
