Functionality: **The function processes two positive integers `n` and `m` (both within the range of 1 to 100) and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output stream by printing 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison.**
