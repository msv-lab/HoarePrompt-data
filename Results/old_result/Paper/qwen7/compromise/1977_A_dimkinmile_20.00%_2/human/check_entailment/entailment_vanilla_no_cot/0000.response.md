Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the function `func_1()` always checks if `n >= m`, which is not sufficient. The correct logic should account for the fact that Nikita can both add and remove cubes, meaning the difference between `n` and `m` must be even (since each pair of add and remove operations cancels out).

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version correctly checks if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is necessary and sufficient for the problem.
