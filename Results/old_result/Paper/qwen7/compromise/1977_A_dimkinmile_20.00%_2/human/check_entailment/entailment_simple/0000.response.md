### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. This part is correct.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Based on this condition, it prints 'Yes' or 'No'. This logic matches the problem statement.
3. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which is in accordance with the problem requirements.
4. **State Analysis**: The state analysis provided is consistent with the program's behavior. It correctly identifies that the values of `n` and `m` are used to determine the output, and the values of `t` remain unchanged throughout the process.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and handles the input and output as specified, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
