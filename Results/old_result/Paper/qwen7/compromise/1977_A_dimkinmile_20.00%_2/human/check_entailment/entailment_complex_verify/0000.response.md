### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `kreker` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - If `n >= m`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic of the function.
- The function does not modify the values of `n` and `m` but simply compares them and prints the result.

#### Correctness Check:
- The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly.
- Specifically, it mentions that when `n` is odd and `m` is `(n + 1) / 2`, the program should return 'Yes', but it returns 'No'.

Let's verify this claim:
- Consider the example provided: `n = 5` and `m = 3`.
  - Initially, `n = 5` and `m = 3`.
  - To achieve `m = 3` cubes, Nikita can follow these steps:
    1. Add 3 cubes (now `n = 8`).
    2. Remove 2 cubes (now `n = 6`).
    3. Remove 1 more cube (now `n = 5`).
    4. Remove 2 more cubes (now `n = 3`).

  - This sequence of operations results in `n = 3` and `m = 3`, satisfying the condition `n >= m`.

- The program correctly prints 'Yes' in this scenario.

#### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd and `m` is `(n + 1) / 2`.
- The logic in the function `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
