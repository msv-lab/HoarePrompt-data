Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints 'Yes' if true, and 'No' otherwise. However, this logic is incorrect because:

- When `n` is odd and `m` is `(n + 1) / 2`, it is still possible to end up with `m` cubes. For example, in the case where `n = 5` and `m = 3`, Nikita can add 3 cubes and then remove 2 cubes, resulting in a tower with 3 cubes. The current implementation would incorrectly return 'No' for this case.

To fix this, the program needs to check if `n` is even and `m` is `n / 2`, or if `n` is odd and `m` is either `(n + 1) / 2` or `(n - 1) / 2`.
