Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `j` is 1 (though this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - The current value of `l[0]` is 2
   - The current value of `l[1]` is 1
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement (though this information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head)

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The loop condition `i <= n - 1` depends on the variables `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, `n - 1` must be greater than 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, the current value of `l[0]` is 2, the current value of `l[1]` is 1**
