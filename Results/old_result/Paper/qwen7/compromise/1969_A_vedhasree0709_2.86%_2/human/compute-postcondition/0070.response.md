Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is reassigned to 0, while `j` remains unchanged at 0. The list `l` retains its original state as it was defined before the code snippet was executed.
