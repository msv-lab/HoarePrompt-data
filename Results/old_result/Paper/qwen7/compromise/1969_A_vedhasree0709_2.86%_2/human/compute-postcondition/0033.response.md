Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and the conditions `l[i-1] == i + 1` and `l[i-2] == i + 2` are met for some `i` between 0 and `n-1`. Since the condition `j == 0` is true, the if part is executed, and the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
