Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `j = 0` initializes the variable `j` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables `i`, `n`, or `l`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged, and `j` is set to 0.
