Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, list `l` has elements such that `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `i`, `n`, or `l`.
