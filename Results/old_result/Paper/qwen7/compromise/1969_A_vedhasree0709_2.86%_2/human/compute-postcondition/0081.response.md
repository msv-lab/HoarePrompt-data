The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, list `l` has elements such that `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1**
