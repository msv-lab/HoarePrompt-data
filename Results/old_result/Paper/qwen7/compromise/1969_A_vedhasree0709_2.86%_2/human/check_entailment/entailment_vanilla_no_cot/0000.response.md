Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error**: The code assumes that if `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, it will print 2. This is too restrictive and does not cover all scenarios where only 2 friends need to be invited.

2. **Edge Cases**: The code fails to consider more complex scenarios, especially when no two consecutive elements form the pattern `i + 2` and `i + 1`. For instance, in the example `[2, 3, 4, 1]`, the solution incorrectly prints `2` instead of `3`.

3. **General Solution**: The general approach should involve identifying cycles and ensuring that at least two friends from any cycle are invited. The current implementation only checks for a specific pattern and does not account for other possible configurations.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Track visited indices to avoid re-inviting already considered friends
        visited = set()
        min_invitations = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i in visited:
                continue
            cycle_size = 0
            j = i
            while j not in visited:
                visited.add(j)
                j = l[j] - 1
                cycle_size += 1
            
            # At least 2 friends need to be invited from this cycle
            min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_size)
        
        print(min_invitations if min_invitations < float('inf') else 2)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all friends are considered and calculates the minimum number of invitations needed correctly.
