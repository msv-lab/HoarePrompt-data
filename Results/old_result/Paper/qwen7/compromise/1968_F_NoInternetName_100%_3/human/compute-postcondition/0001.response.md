Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while l + 1 < r`. The variables involved are `l` and `r`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `l + 1 < r`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is the length of `arr`.

4. **Check the Condition with Current Values**:
   - Substituting the current values into the condition: `0 + 1 < r` simplifies to `1 < r`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `r` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `l` is already 0 (which is fixed), we only need to adjust `r` to ensure the condition `1 < r` is met.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure `r` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` is 0, `r` is the length of `arr` and `r` must be greater than 1**
