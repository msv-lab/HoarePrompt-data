Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is \(|n - m|\), `f` is now \(k - 2^p\) and must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the binary string representation of `f` (without the '0b' prefix) and assigns it to `p`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
