Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is \(|n - m|\), `f` is now \(k - 2^p - 2^{(p - 1)} - 2^{(p - 1)} - 2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is a binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `f` decreases by \(2^{(p - 1)}\). Since the loop continues as long as `f & f - 1 != 0`, which means `f` has more than one bit set in its binary representation, the loop will continue until `f` becomes a power of 2 or 0. Once `f` is reduced to a single bit (i.e., \(2^{(p - 1)}\)), the condition `f & f - 1 != 0` will no longer hold true, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `f` will be the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k - 2^p - 2^{(p - 1)} - 2^{(p - 1)} - 2^{(p - 1)}`, and `p` will be the length of the binary representation of this final value of `f`.
