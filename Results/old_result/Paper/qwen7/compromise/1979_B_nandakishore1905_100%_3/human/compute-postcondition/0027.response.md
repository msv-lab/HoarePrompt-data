Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `q` is calculated as 2 ** (p - 1)**.

Explanation: The code `q = 2 ** (p - 1)` calculates the value of `q` as \(2\) raised to the power of \((p - 1)\). Here, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
