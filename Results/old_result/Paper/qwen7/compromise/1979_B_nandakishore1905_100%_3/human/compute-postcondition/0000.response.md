Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` (which is `int(input())`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given the constraints, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is 0.

Based on these steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `t` (which is `int(input())`) must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `i` is 0**.
