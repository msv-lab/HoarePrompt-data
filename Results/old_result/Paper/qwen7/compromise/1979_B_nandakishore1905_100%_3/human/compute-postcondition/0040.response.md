Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` updates the variable `l` to be the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
