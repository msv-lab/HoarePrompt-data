Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string indicating the relationship between x and y for each test case where t is the number of test cases. For each test case, if x is less than y, it returns "x is less than y"; if x is equal to y, it returns "x is equal to y"; if x is greater than y, it returns "x is greater than y".**

Note: The problem statement does not specify the exact output format for multiple test cases, so the functionality is described based on a single test case scenario.
