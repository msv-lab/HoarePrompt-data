Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins and their facing directions.
2. The solution involves reading test cases from standard input, which are processed by two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` correctly reads the test cases and formats them into a list of tuples, each containing the number of coins and the string representing their initial facing directions.
4. `func_2` calculates the number of coins facing up ("U") and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even:
   - If the count of "U" is odd, `func_2` returns 'YES', indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of "U" is even, `func_2` returns 'NO', indicating Bob wins.
5. Given the problem statement and the examples provided, the logic in `func_2` aligns with the rules of the game. Specifically, the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of coins facing up initially.
6. The provided examples match the expected behavior of the functions:
   - For the input "UUDUD", there are 3 "U"s, so the output is "YES".
   - For the input "UDDUD", there are 2 "U"s, so the output is "NO".
   - For the input "UU", there are 2 "U"s, so the output is "NO".

Based on the above reasoning, the given program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game.

Correctness: **True**
