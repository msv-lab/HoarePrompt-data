Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the result of the print statement inside the loop for each iteration. Specifically, for each iteration \(i\) from 0 to \(t-1\), the value printed will be either 2 or \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\), depending on whether \(m\) is less than \(a\) or \(b\).
