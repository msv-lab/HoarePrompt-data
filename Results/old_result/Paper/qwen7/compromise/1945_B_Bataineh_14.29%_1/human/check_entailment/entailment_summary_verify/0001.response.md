### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.
   - The key is to determine how many fireworks from each installation can be seen at the same time within the visibility period.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It checks if `m` is less than `a` or `b`. If true, it prints `2`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation using integer division (`m // a` and `m // b`) and adds `2` (to account for the initial fireworks from both installations).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for checking if `m < a` or `m < b` is incorrect. This condition does not accurately determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` assumes that the fireworks from both installations can overlap perfectly, which is not always the case.
   - The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of simultaneous launches and then calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step:
     - If `m < a` or `m < b`, the solution prints `2`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of simultaneous launches.
     - If `m >= a` and `m >= b`, the solution calculates the number of fireworks from each installation using integer division and adds `2`. This also has issues because it doesn't correctly handle the periodicity and overlaps.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
     - Find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
     - Determine the number of simultaneous launches within the visibility period `m + 1`.
     - Use the LCM to find the periodicity and count overlaps.

6. **Function Summary Recap:**
   - The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(t\), \(a\), and \(m\).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) from the input.
   - If \(m\) is less than either \(a\) or \(b\), it prints `2`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the value of \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The given solution is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the periodicity and overlaps of fireworks from both installations.
   - The provided program is not correct.
