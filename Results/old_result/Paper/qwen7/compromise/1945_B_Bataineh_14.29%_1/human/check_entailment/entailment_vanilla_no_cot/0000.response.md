Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the `if` statement is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if m < a or m < b:` is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

To solve this problem accurately, we need to consider the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The correct approach involves calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and then accounting for any overlaps.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate LCM of a and b
        l = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period
        count_a = (m // a) + 1
        count_b = (m // b) + 1
        # Calculate the number of simultaneous fireworks
        simultaneous_fireworks = (m // l) + 1
        # The maximum number of fireworks seen simultaneously is the sum of individual counts minus the simultaneous ones plus 1 for the initial overlap
        max_simultaneous = count_a + count_b - simultaneous_fireworks + 1
        print(max_simultaneous)

func()
```

This corrected function properly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by considering the LCM of `a` and `b` and adjusting for overlaps.
