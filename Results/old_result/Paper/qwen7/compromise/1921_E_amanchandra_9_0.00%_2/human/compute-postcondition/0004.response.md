Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). It checks if x_a and x_b are distinct and if y_a and y_b are distinct. Depending on the positions of (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b), it outputs 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. If x_a > x_b, it always outputs 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates a range based on the distance between x_a and x_b and checks if y_a or y_b falls within this range to determine the output.**
