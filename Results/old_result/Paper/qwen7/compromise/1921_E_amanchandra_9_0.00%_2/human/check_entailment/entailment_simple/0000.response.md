Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `xa, ya, xb, yb`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The program checks if `xa > xb`. If this condition is true, it directly prints 'Draw', which is correct because Alice cannot reach Bob's position if she starts below Bob. 

3. **Position Calculation and Decision Making**:
   - If `xa <= xb`, the program calculates the distance between Alice and Bob in the vertical direction (`x = abs(xa - xb)`).
   - It then checks if this distance is odd or even.
   - Depending on whether the distance is odd or even, it calculates the possible range of columns for Bob (`l` and `r`).
   - It then checks if Alice's current column (`ya`) falls within this range plus an additional buffer (for odd distances) to determine if Alice can capture Bob or if Bob can capture Alice.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - If `xa <= xb` and the distance is odd, it checks if Alice's column `ya` is within the range `[l, r]` plus an additional buffer (`x + 1`). If so, Alice can win, otherwise, it's a draw.
   - If `xa <= xb` and the distance is even, it checks if Bob's column `yb` is within the range `[l, r]`. If so, Bob can win, otherwise, it's a draw.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the columns might be out of bounds by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)` to ensure the calculated columns are within the board limits.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the relative positions and distances is sound and aligns with the rules of the game.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given constraints and rules.

Correctness: **True**
