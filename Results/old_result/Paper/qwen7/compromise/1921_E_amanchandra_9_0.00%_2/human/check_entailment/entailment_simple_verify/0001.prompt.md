You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', and 'Bob' based on the conditions specified within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if `xa > xb`, the output will be 'Draw'. Otherwise, depending on the positions of `ya` and `yb` relative to the calculated range, the output will be either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, parsing the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Position Check**:
   - The program checks if `xa` (Alice's row position) is greater than `xb` (Bob's row position). If this condition is true, it prints "Draw". This part is correct because if Alice is in a higher row than Bob, Alice cannot reach Bob's position before Bob can move away, leading to a draw.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, which represents the vertical distance between Alice and Bob. This is done using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.

4. **Odd Distance Check**:
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), the program calculates the range of possible positions for Bob and Alice. Specifically, it calculates the left (`l`) and right (`r`) bounds for Bob's possible positions.
   - It then checks if Alice can capture Bob within these bounds. If both bounds allow Alice to capture Bob (i.e., `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`), Alice can win. Otherwise, it results in a draw.

5. **Even Distance Check**:
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, the program calculates the range of possible positions for Alice and Bob similarly. It then checks if Bob can capture Alice within these bounds. If both bounds allow Bob to capture Alice (i.e., `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`), Bob can win. Otherwise, it results in a draw.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program uses list indexing to format the output string correctly based on the conditions checked.

### Conclusion:
The program logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
