Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Data Collection**: For each test case, it collects four pairs of coordinates into a list `a`.
3. **Coordinate Extraction**: It extracts the x-coordinates into a list `x`.
4. **Width Calculation**: It calculates the width of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`).
5. **Area Calculation**: It prints the area of the square, which is simply `dx * dx`.

Given the problem constraints and the guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the logic is sound. The program correctly identifies the side length of the square by the difference in x-coordinates and then squares it to get the area.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
