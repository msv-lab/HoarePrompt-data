Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the area of the square. Given the constraints and the fact that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will give the side length of the square. Squaring this difference gives the area. The program iterates over each test case, reads the coordinates of the four corners, and then calculates and prints the area of the square.
