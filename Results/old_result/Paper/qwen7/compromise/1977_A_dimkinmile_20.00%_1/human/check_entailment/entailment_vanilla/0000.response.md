Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads an integer `kreker` which represents the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then runs a loop for each test case. Inside this loop, it calls `func_1()`.
3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a logical error because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.
4. **Processing Each Test Case**: Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes respectively.
5. **Condition Check**: It checks if `n` (number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (desired number of cubes).
6. **Output**: If the condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Analysis:
- The program correctly processes each test case by checking if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
- However, there is a logical error because the function `func_1()` is not being called inside the loop that iterates over the test cases. Instead, it is called once before the loop starts.

### Corrected Version:
To fix the issue, we need to call `func_1()` inside the loop that iterates over the test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, m)

def func_1(n, m):
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the missing call to `func_1()` inside the loop. After fixing this, the program will work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
