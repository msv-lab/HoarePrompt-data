Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop that runs `kreker` times.
   
2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used within the main loop. This is a mistake because the function should be called inside the loop to process each test case.

3. **Test Case Processing:**
   - Inside the loop, the program calls `func_1()`, which is supposed to handle each test case.
   - `func_1()` correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Logic Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is correct. After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can only be between `0` and `n` inclusive. Therefore, if `n >= m`, it is possible to have `m` cubes, and if `n < m`, it is not possible.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical error due to the unused function `func_1()`. However, if we assume the intention was to call `func_1()` inside the loop, the logic within `func_1()` itself is correct.

Given this analysis, the program would be correct if `func_1()` were called inside the loop. Since it is not, the program is technically incorrect due to the unused function.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
