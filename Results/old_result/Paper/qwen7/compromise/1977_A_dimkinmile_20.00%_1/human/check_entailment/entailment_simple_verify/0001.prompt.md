You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: 'No'
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an input integer, m is an input integer. If n is greater than or equal to m, no change is made to n. If n is less than m, n is set to a value less than m.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop that runs `kreker` times.
   
2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used within the main loop. This is a mistake because the function should be called inside the loop to process each test case.

3. **Test Case Processing:**
   - Inside the loop, the program calls `func_1()`, which is supposed to handle each test case.
   - `func_1()` correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Logic Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` is correct. After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can only be between `0` and `n` inclusive. Therefore, if `n >= m`, it is possible to have `m` cubes, and if `n < m`, it is not possible.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical error due to the unused function `func_1()`. However, if we assume the intention was to call `func_1()` inside the loop, the logic within `func_1()` itself is correct.

Given this analysis, the program would be correct if `func_1()` were called inside the loop. Since it is not, the program is technically incorrect due to the unused function.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
