Reasoning:
- The annotated program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
- However, there is a logical flaw in the provided code. The code does not actually perform any operations to adjust `n` based on whether `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Instead, it simply prints "Yes" or "No" based on the initial comparison.
- Given the problem statement, the goal is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic should check if `n` can be reduced to `m` through a series of moves where each move either adds or removes one cube. This means `n` must be exactly `m` because each move changes the count by exactly 1.
- Therefore, the correct logic would be to check if `n == m`, not just if `n >= m`.

Given this analysis, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the process of adding or removing cubes.

Correctness: **False**
