Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking if the number of moves \( n \) is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes \( m \). If this condition is met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". 

However, the program's implementation has an issue because the `func_1` function is called without passing any arguments inside the loop. This means that `func_1` is being called with undefined variables, which is incorrect based on the problem statement.

To fix this, the `input()` call should be moved inside the loop where `func_1` is defined, ensuring that `n` and `m` are correctly read for each test case.

Given the current logic and the fact that the `func_1` function is incorrectly called, the program does not correctly implement the solution as intended.

Correctness: **False**
