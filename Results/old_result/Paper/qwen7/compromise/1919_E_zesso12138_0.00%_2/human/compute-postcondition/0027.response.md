Output State: `data` remains unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * (n + 3)`, `t` is `t - 3`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n` for each iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for all iterations.

In this final state, the `index` pointer will have moved forward by a total of `3 * (n + 3)` positions through the `data` list, since it advances by `n + 3` positions per iteration and the loop runs 3 times. The variable `t` will have been decremented by 3 because the loop runs 3 times. The list `p` will be updated for each of the 3 iterations, based on the values in `data` starting from the current `index` position and of length `n`. The `result` will be the outcome of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and these results will be appended to the `results` list, making it contain 3 elements.
