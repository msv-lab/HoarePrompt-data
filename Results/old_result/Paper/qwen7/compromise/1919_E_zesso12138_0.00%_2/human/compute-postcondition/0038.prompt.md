You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations includes `data` remaining unchanged, `index` being `index + 3 * (n + 3)`, `t` reduced to `t - 3`, `p` being a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n` for each iteration, `result` being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `results` being a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for all iterations.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is an element of `results` for each iteration of the loop, and since the loop prints each element of `results` exactly once, after all iterations, `res` will contain all elements of `results` printed in the order they were computed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `res` will hold each value from the `results` list in sequence, as each value in `results` is printed exactly once during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`; and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers where |p_i| ≤ n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not return anything as the function signature indicates no return value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
