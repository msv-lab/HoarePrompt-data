Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the return value of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `results`. The values of `data`, `index`, `p`, and `result` remain as they were before, except that `results` now contains an additional element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
