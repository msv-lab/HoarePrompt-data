Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`, `j` is \(2 * n + 1\), and `n` is at least 1.**

Explanation: The line `dp = new_dp` updates the `dp` list to be exactly the same as the `new_dp` list. Since the `new_dp` list was updated during the loop to contain the cumulative sums of `dp` elements, starting from the end towards the beginning, with each element updated modulo `MOD`, this assignment ensures that `dp` now holds these same values. The loop has completed, setting `j` to `2 * n + 1`, and `n` remains at least 1.
