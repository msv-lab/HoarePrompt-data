Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`; and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers where |p_i| ≤ n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not return anything as the function signature indicates no return value.**

This means the function `func_2` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of elements `n` in an array `a`, and a sorted list `p` of integers. However, since the function signature does not specify any return value, it likely performs some operation or series of operations on the input data without returning a result.
