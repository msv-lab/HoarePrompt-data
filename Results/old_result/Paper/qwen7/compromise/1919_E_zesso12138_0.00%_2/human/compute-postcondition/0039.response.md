Output State: **After all iterations, `j` will be equal to `2 * n`, `n` will be at least 1, and `new_dp` will be updated such that for each index `j` from 0 to `2 * n`, `new_dp[j]` will be the sum of all `dp[k]` where `k` was greater than 0 and within the bounds of `new_dp`, modulo `MOD`.**

This means that after the loop completes, `new_dp[j]` will contain the cumulative sum of `dp[k]` values for all valid `k` indices that were greater than 0, adjusted for the range of `new_dp` which is of length `2 * n + 1`. The updates are done in a way that each `dp[j]` contributes to its neighboring indices in `new_dp` until `j` reaches `2 * n`.
