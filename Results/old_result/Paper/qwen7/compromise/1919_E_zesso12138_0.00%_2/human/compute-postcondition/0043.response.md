Output State: **`j` is equal to `2 * n`, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * n + 1 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_dp` as a list containing `2 * n + 1` zeros. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `dp` is set to be equal to `new_dp`.
