Postcondition: **`j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `j` will be `2 * n + 1`, indicating that the loop has terminated. `n` remains at least 1, and `dp` is still equal to `new_dp`, which is a list of `2 * n + 1` zeros. The condition `j + 1 <= 2 * n` is no longer true, so the loop does not execute further.
