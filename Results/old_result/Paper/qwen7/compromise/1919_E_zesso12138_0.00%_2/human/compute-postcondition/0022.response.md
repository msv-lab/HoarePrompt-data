Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 3`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value from `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Given the initial state, `index` was originally `index + n + 2`. After incrementing, `index` becomes `index + n + 3`. All other variables (`data`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.
