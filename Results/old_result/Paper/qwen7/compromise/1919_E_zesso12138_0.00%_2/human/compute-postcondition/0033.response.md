Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for res in results:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list, and `res` is the variable that takes on the value of each element in the list during each iteration.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `res` is an element of `results`.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `res` needs to be set to the next element in the `results` list.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `res` is the variable that changes with each iteration, it needs to be updated to the next element in the `results` list. Additionally, since the loop is iterating over the `results` list, the `results` list itself does not change; it remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `res` is now the next element in the `results` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is the next element of `results`**
