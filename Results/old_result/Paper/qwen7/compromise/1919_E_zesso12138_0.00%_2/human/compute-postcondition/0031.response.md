Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `res` as it iterates over the `results` list.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` is an element of `results`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `res` needs to be set to the next element in the `results` list.
   - Since `res` was an element of `results` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in the list will be assigned to `res`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new state should reflect that `res` is now the next element in the `results` list.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`res` is an element of `results` (the next element in the list)**

However, to provide a more specific answer, we need to denote the exact nature of the change. Since `res` was an element of `results` before, the next element in the list will be the one assigned to `res` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`res` is an element of `results` (the next element in the list)**
