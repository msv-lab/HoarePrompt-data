Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using spaces, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `index`, `t`, `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged.
