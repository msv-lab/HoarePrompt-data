Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` now contains the list containing the first input number and the second input number plus the first input number, and `x` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to `lst[b]`. Initially, `lst[b]` contains the first input number plus the second input number. After appending `a`, `lst[b]` will contain the first input number, the second input number, and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
