Output State: **`lst[x]` is a list with one element less than before, `x` is equal to `y`, and `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. Before the assignment, `y` was the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped. Therefore, after the assignment, `x` now holds the value of `y`, which is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation. The list `lst[x]` remains with one element less than before, and the value of `y` is unchanged.
