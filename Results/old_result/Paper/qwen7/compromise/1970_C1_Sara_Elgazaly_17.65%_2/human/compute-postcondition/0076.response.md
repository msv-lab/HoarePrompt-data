Output State: **`lst[x]'` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `lst[y]'` is a non-empty list containing the element that was popped from `lst[x]'`, and `y` is the element that was popped from `lst[x]'`.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops an element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to the variable `y`. Since `lst[x]` was a non-empty list, it now has one less element. The element that was popped is added to `lst[y]`, making `lst[y]` a non-empty list containing that element.
