Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number; `b` is an integer equal to the second input number**.

This means that the code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b` respectively. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
