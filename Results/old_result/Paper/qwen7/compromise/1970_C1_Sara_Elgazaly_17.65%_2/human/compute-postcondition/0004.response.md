Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number; `b` is an integer equal to the second input number; `lst[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list at index `a`. Since `a` is an integer equal to the first input number and `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, after executing the code, the list at index `a` will contain `b` appended to whatever was already there at that index. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, but the list `lst` at index `a` is modified.
