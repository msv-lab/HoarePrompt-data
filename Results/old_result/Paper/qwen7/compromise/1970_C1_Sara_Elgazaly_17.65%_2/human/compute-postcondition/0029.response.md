Postcondition: `s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` both contain a list of integers representing all the nodes connected to `a` and `b` respectively, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is set to `y` and `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping it.
