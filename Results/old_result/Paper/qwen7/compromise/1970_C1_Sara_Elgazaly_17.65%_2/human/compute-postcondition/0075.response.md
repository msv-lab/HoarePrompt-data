Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `while lst[x]:`
- Postcondition: `lst[x]'` is a list with one less element.
- If `lst[y]'` is not an empty list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `lst[y]'` is an empty list, no additional information is provided about the state of `lst[x]'` or `y`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `lst[x]` is not empty.
2. **Postcondition**: After each iteration, `lst[x]` has one less element.
3. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks if `lst[y]` is not an empty list.

### Adjusting the State:
- **Variable `lst[x]`**: Since the postcondition tells us that `lst[x]` has one less element after each iteration, we need to ensure that `lst[x]` is not empty before the next iteration. This means `lst[x]` must have at least one element.
- **Variable `lst[y]`**: We don't have any specific information about `lst[y]` from the postcondition, but we know that if `lst[y]` is not empty, the loop will break. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst[y]` is an empty list to allow the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `lst[x]` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one element) and `lst[y]` is an empty list.

### Final State:
State: **`lst[x]'` is a non-empty list and `lst[y]'` is an empty list**
