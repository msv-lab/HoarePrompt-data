Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` now contains the list containing the first input number plus the second input number, and `x` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `lst[a]`. Initially, `lst[b]` contains the first input number, which means `lst` is at least a list with an index `b` that holds the first input number. After appending `b` to `lst[a]`, `lst[a]` now contains both the first and the second input numbers. All other variables remain unchanged.
