Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while lst[x]:`.
2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `lst[x]` is a list with one element less than before.
   - If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to the list.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, `lst[x]` must be non-empty (`lst[x] != []`).

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `lst[x]` is a list with one element less than before, it means that `lst[x]` was non-empty at the start of the current iteration but has become empty now.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `lst[x]` must be non-empty at the start of the next iteration. This means we need to add an element back to `lst[x]`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - We need to ensure that `lst[x]` is non-empty at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to add an element back to `lst[x]`.

Given this analysis, the new state should be:

State: **`lst[x]` is a list with one element added back, making it non-empty**.
