Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[b]` now contains the list containing the first input number, and `x` must be greater than 2**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial state of `lst[b]` containing `[a]` remains unchanged, and the condition that `x` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
