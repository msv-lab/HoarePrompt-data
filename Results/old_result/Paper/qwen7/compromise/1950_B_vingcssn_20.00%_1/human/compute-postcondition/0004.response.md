Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is between 1 and 20 inclusive, and `n` is between 1 and 20 inclusive. Based on the values of `t` and `n`, the function returns a specific output.**

However, since the exact output logic is not provided in the problem statement, the functionality can be described as processing two integers within specified ranges and returning a result based on their values.
