Output State: **`casos` is an input integer and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The code `casos = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `casos`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
