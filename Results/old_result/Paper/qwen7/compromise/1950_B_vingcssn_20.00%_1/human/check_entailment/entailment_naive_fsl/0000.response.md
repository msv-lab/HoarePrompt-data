Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and includes a condition for values outside this range, which is not required by the problem description. The problem description asks for a general solution that works for any \( n \) within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The program fails to generate the correct checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) other than 1, 2, 3, and 4. For example, if \( n = 5 \), the program will not produce the correct output. Here is an example of how the output should look for \( n = 5 \):

Since the program does not handle general cases for \( n \), it is incorrect.
