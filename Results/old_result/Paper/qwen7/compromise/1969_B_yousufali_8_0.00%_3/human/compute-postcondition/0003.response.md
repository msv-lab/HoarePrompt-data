Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the input is a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the string that needs to be sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The function returns the result of sorting each binary string `s` in non-descending order through cyclic shifts.**

This means the function will process `t` test cases, where each test case involves a binary string `s`. The function will sort each binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts and then return the sorted strings.
