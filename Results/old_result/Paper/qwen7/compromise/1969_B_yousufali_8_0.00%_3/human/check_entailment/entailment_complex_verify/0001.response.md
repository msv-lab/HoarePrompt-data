### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process a binary string and calculate the minimum cost to sort it.
   - The current implementation reads a list of integers from user input, which is incorrect since the input should be a binary string.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed. It increments `n` when it encounters a `1` and adds `n + 1` to `ans` when it encounters a `0`. This does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the positions where the binary string changes from `1` to `0` and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all `1`s to the beginning and all `0`s to the end.
   - We need to find the longest prefix that is sorted and then calculate the cost of shifting the remaining part to its correct position.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct approach involves identifying the longest prefix of `1`s and then calculating the cost of cyclic shifts for the rest of the string.
   - For example, if the string is `101011`, the longest prefix of `1`s is `111`, and the remaining part is `011`. The cost would be calculated as follows:
     - Shift `101011` to `011101` (cost = 5).
     - Shift `011101` to `111010` (cost = 4).
     - Total cost = 5 + 4 = 9.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the analysis, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
