Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: 
   - Function 1 is designed to process a list of integers (which should represent a binary string). It counts the number of consecutive 1s and adds 1 for each segment of 0s. However, the problem specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. The function `func_1()` is not correctly handling the binary string input as per the problem statement. It should take a binary string as input and process it accordingly.
   
2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - Function 2 is supposed to handle multiple test cases. It calls `func_1()` for each test case, which is problematic because `func_1()` is not correctly implemented for the problem requirements. Additionally, `func_2()` does not implement the logic to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts, which is required by the problem statement.

Given these observations, the provided functions do not correctly implement the solution for the problem. They do not handle the binary string input properly and do not include the logic to sort the string using cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **False**
