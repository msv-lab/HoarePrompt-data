### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to process a single test case. However, it incorrectly processes the input as a list of integers rather than a binary string. The input should be a single binary string, not a list of integers.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed. It increments `n` when it encounters a `1` and adds `n + 1` to `ans` when it encounters a `0`. This does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, `func_1` is incorrectly implemented as explained above.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the positions where the binary string changes from `1` to `0` and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all `1`s to the beginning and all `0`s to the end.
   - We need to find the longest prefix that is sorted and then calculate the cost of shifting the remaining part to its correct position.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct approach involves identifying the boundaries between `1`s and `0`s and calculating the cost of cyclic shifts based on these boundaries.
   - For example, if the string is "101011", the longest prefix of `1`s is "11" and the rest is "0101". The cost would be calculated as follows:
     - Shift "0101" to the front: "010111" (cost = 4).
     - Total cost = 4.

6. **Reviewing the Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_1` is called for each test case, but it processes the input incorrectly.
   - The annotated code also shows that `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` is still incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
