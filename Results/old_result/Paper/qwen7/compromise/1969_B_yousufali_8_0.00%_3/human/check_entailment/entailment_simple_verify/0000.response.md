### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect and how it fails to meet the requirements of the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts, and the cost of each operation is the length of the substring shifted. The goal is to minimize the total cost.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads a list of integers from the input, which is incorrect because the input should be a binary string.
   - It then iterates through the list and counts the number of consecutive 1's (`n`) and adds the cost (`n + 1`) whenever a 0 is encountered after a sequence of 1's.
   - This logic does not account for the cyclic nature of the shifts required to sort the string.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, `func_1` still processes the input incorrectly as a list of integers instead of a binary string.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input string "101011":
- If we follow the logic in `func_1`, it would process the string as a list of integers `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
- It would count the number of consecutive 1's and add the cost when encountering a 0, resulting in an incorrect output.

For the correct solution, we need to identify the longest prefix of zeros and the longest suffix of ones, and then calculate the cost based on the positions of these segments. The provided code does not handle this logic, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
