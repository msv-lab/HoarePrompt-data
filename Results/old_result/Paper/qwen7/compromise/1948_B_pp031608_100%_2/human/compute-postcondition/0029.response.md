Output State: **`i` is `m-3`, `m` remains greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last character of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional structure. The values of `i`, `m`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
