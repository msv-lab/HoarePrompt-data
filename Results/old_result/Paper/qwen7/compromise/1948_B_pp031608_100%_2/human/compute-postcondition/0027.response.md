Output State: **`i` is `m-3`, `m` remains greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last character of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by converting the last character of `arr[i-1]` into an integer and appending it to the list, then appending the element `arr[i]` to the same list. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
