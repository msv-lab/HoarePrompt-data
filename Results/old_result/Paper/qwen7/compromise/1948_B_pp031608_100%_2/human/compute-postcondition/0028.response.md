Output State: **`i` is `m-3`, `m` remains greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last character of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, or `nums`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `ans` now set to `False`.
