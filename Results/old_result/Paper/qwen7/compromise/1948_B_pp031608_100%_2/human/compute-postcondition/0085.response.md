Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `nums` is not sorted.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their previous states remain unchanged.
