Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr[0]` is the result after all iterations where each element `arr[i]` (for `i` from `m-1` down to 1) has been checked against `arr[i-1]` and possibly updated to ensure it is not less than `arr[i-1]` unless it causes the digits when concatenated to be unsorted, in which case `ans` is set to `False`. If no such condition was met throughout all iterations, `ans` remains `True`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `m` will be greater than 0, `i` will be 0, `arr[0]` will be the final value of the array after all necessary comparisons and updates, and `ans` will be `False` if any pair of consecutive elements were found to violate the sorting condition when their digits were concatenated, otherwise `ans` will remain `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `m` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers where each element has been processed according to the conditions in the loop, and `ans` is False if any condition caused `ans` to be set to False during the loop's execution; otherwise, `ans` remains True.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations (since `i` is now 0 and the loop runs from `m-1` down to 0). The value of `m` is 0 because the loop counter `i` has reached 0. The list `arr` has been modified as per the operations inside the loop. The variable `ans` is False if any of the conditions within the loop caused it to be set to False; otherwise, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digit of `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If at any point during the loop's execution, `arr[i]` is found to be less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
