Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-1`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[i-1]` concatenated with `arr[i]`, and `nums` is a list containing these digits.**

Explanation: The code converts the string representation of `arr[i-1]` into a list of integers, then appends the integer value of `arr[i]` to this list. Since `arr[i]` is originally less than `arr[i-1]`, the new list `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the digit of `arr[i]`. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged.
