Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers where each element has been processed according to the conditions in the loop, and `ans` is False if any condition caused `ans` to be set to False during the loop's execution; otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. The values of `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
