Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code converts the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of integers using a list comprehension and concatenates it with the list containing `arr[i]`. Since `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the condition for `m` being greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged. The value of `i` remains 0, and the relationship between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` also remains unchanged. The new variable `nums` is created and contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the value of `arr[i]`.
