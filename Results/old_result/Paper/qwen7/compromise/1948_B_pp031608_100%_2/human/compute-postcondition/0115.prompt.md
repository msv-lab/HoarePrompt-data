You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `m` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers that has been processed according to the conditions in the loop, and `ans` is `False` if any condition caused `ans` to be set to `False` during the loop's execution; otherwise, `ans` remains `True`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `m` will be 0 because the loop runs from `m-1` down to 0. The list `arr` will have been modified as per the operations inside the loop. The variable `ans` will be `False` if at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` was met and the digits when concatenated were found to be unsorted, causing `ans` to be set to `False`. Otherwise, `ans` will remain `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input through multiple lines. It first reads an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 50, followed by `n` integers each between 0 and 99. The function then returns a result based on the processed data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
