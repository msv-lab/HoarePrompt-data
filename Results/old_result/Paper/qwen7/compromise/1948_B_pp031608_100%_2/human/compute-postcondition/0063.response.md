Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is at least 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`.
   - `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to False.
   - If the current state of `nums` is not sorted, `ans` remains False.
   - If `nums` is already sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = m - 1` to `i = 1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be `0`.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - `i` will be 0.
   - `m` remains at least 2.
   - The conditions related to `arr`, `nums`, and `ans` remain the same since they are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to False. If the current state of `nums` is not sorted, `ans` remains False. If `nums` is already sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.**
