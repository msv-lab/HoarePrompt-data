Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`.
   - `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digit of `arr[i]`.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is `nums[0]`.
   - `nums` is constructed from the digits of `arr[i-1]` (which doesn't exist since `i-1` would be -1, but we assume it's an empty list for this case) followed by the digit of `arr[i]`, so `nums` is `[nums[0]]`.
   - The condition in the loop checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. Since `arr[i - 1]` does not exist, we consider the initial state where `arr[i]` is `nums[0]` and there is no previous element to compare with.
   - Given that `ans` remains unchanged, and no condition in the loop changes `ans`, `ans` must be either `True` or `False` based on the initial state.

4. **Determine `ans`:**
   - Since `arr[i]` is `nums[0]` and there is no previous element to compare, the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is not met initially.
   - Therefore, `ans` is `True`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement uses a ternary expression to determine the output based on the value of `ans`.
   - If `ans` is `True`, it prints `'YES'`.
   - If `ans` is `False`, it prints `'NO'`.

Given that `ans` is `True` based on the initial state, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
