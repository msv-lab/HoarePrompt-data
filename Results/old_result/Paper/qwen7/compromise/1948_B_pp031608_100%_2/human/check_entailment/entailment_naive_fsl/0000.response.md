Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to sort the array using the specified operation. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and then attempts to split the previous element into its digits and compare them. However, this approach does not fully consider the possibility of making the array sorted through multiple operations.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```
- Expected Output:
```
YES
```
- Actual Output:
```
NO
```

The program fails to recognize that the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]` can be transformed into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. The program incorrectly determines that it is not possible to sort the array because it only checks the immediate previous elements without considering the cumulative effect of multiple operations.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to ensure that after performing the splitting operation, the resulting array is checked for non-decreasing order iteratively until no more operations can be performed.
