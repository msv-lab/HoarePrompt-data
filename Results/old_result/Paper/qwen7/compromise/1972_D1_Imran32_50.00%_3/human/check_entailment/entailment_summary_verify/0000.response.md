### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\),
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program
The program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. It calculates \(ans\) using the formula \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{int}(\sqrt{n})+1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\).
4. Prints the value of \(ans\) for each test case.

#### Function Summary
The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates \(ans\) as described above. It does not directly address the problem's requirements but rather uses a different approach involving the square root of \(n\).

#### Analysis
1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program uses a formula that does not relate to the problem's constraints. Specifically, the formula \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not addressed by the program's logic.
2. **Test Case Example**: Consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
   - Expected output: Pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 1)\) satisfy the condition.
   - Expected count: 4.
   - Program output: 3 (as per the original assessment).

Given these points, the program indeed does not correctly solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate because the program's logic does not match the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not solve the given problem according to the specified conditions.
