Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The logic in `func_1()` is designed to handle a different problem, specifically counting the number of integers up to `n` that are perfect squares and their multiples. This does not align with the problem statement which requires counting ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement an algorithm that checks each pair `(a, b)` within the given ranges and verifies whether the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true. Here's a more appropriate approach:

```python
import math

"""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**
*                      BISMILLAHIR RAHMANIR RAHEEM                         *                                                    *
**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"""
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```

This solution iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and counts those that satisfy the given condition.
