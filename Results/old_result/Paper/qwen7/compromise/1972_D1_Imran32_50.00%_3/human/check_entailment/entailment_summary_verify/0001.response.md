### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues and verify the solution step-by-step.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop in `func_1` iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n}\) and does not consider all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - This loop does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The calculation inside the loop does not reflect the required condition. Instead, it seems to be counting something else, likely related to the square root of \(n\), which is unrelated to the problem.

3. **Lack of Proper Condition Check**:
   - The program does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected program:
1. Iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.
2. Checks if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Counts and prints the number of valid pairs for each test case.

Given the corrected approach, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).
