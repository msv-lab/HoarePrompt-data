Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem statement. The program calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on a specific formula but does not actually check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it calculates a value based on the square root of \(n\), which is unrelated to the actual problem requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

The current implementation does not perform this check and thus cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
