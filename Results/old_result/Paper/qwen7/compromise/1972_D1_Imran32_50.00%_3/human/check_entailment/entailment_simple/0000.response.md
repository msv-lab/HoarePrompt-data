Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). Specifically, the code attempts to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a fixed \(b\) by iterating through possible values of \(i\) and using a formula that does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided code does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates a sum involving square roots and divisions which does not align with the problem statement.

Given the discrepancy between the problem's requirements and the implemented logic, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
