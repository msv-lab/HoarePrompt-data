You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    #
    #This output state describes the final value of `ans` after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration of the loop by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` to its current value, where `i` ranges from 2 to `root` (inclusive), and `root` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each valid test case, it calculates the value of \( ans \) as \( n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{int}(\sqrt{n})+1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor \), where \( \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \) denotes the floor function (rounding down to the nearest integer). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \( ans \) for the last test case. If any test case fails to meet the conditions (i.e., \( n \) and \( m \) are not within the specified range or their sums exceed the limit), the function still processes the valid part and prints the result accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here is the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is not relevant to the problem's constraints.
   - The variable `cnt` is set to \(i \times i\), and `ans` is incremented based on this value, which does not reflect the required condition.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The current implementation does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - It instead seems to be counting something else, likely related to the square root of \(n\), which is unrelated to the problem.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
