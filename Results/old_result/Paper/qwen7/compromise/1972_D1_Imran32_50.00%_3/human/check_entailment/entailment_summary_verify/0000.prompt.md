You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each valid test case, it calculates the value of \( ans \) as \( n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{int}(\sqrt{n})+1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor \), where \( \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \) denotes the floor function (rounding down to the nearest integer). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \( ans \) for the last test case. If any test case fails to meet the conditions (i.e., \( n \) and \( m \) are not within the specified range or their sums exceed the limit), the function still processes the valid part and prints the result accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to counting pairs based on a square root-based approach, which is not relevant to the given problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

Expected output:
- Pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 1)\) satisfy the condition.
- Output should be 4.

However, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not handle the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
