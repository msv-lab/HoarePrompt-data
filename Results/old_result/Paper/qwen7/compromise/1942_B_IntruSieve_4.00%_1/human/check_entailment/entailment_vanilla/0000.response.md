Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The function should return a valid permutation \( p \).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `mex` to store the MEX values and `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends the current minimum value (`minn`) to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between the negative of \( a_i \) and `minn` to `mex`.
     - It updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `mex`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating MEX values seems to be flawed. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The current implementation does not correctly calculate the MEX values for each prefix of the permutation \( p \).
   - The code assumes that the MEX can be directly derived from the negative of \( a_i \), which is not always true.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     - Input: `5 1 1 -2 1 2`
     - Expected output: `0 1 4 2 3`
     - The code's output is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the MEX values.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
