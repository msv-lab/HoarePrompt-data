### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - The function should return a valid permutation \( p \).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `mex` to store the MEX values and `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends the current minimum value (`minn`) to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between the negative of \( a_i \) and `minn` to `mex`.
     - It updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `mex`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating MEX values is indeed flawed. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The current implementation does not correctly calculate the MEX values for each prefix of the permutation \( p \).
   - The code assumes that the MEX can be directly derived from the negative of \( a_i \), which is not always true.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     - Input: `5 1 1 -2 1 2`
     - Expected output: `0 1 4 2 3`
     - The code's output is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the MEX values.
   - Let's walk through the example step-by-step:
     - For \( i = 0 \): \( a_0 = 1 \)
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([p_0]) - p_0 = 1 \)
       - Since \( p_0 \) is unknown, we assume \( p_0 = 0 \) (the smallest unused value).
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([0]) = 1\)
       - So, \( a_0 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
     - For \( i = 1 \): \( a_1 = 1 \)
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([0, p_1]) - p_1 = 1 \)
       - Since \( p_1 \) is unknown, we assume \( p_1 = 1 \) (the next smallest unused value).
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) = 2\)
       - So, \( a_1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
     - For \( i = 2 \): \( a_2 = -2 \)
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([0, 1, p_2]) - p_2 = -2 \)
       - Since \( p_2 \) is unknown, we assume \( p_2 = 4 \) (the next smallest unused value).
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) = 2\)
       - So, \( a_2 = 2 - 4 = -2 \)
     - For \( i = 3 \): \( a_3 = 1 \)
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, p_3]) - p_3 = 1 \)
       - Since \( p_3 \) is unknown, we assume \( p_3 = 2 \) (the next smallest unused value).
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) = 3\)
       - So, \( a_3 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
     - For \( i = 4 \): \( a_4 = 2 \)
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, p_4]) - p_4 = 2 \)
       - Since \( p_4 \) is unknown, we assume \( p_4 = 3 \) (the next smallest unused value).
       - \(\texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) = 5\)
       - So, \( a_4 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)

   - The code does not correctly handle the MEX calculation, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating MEX values is flawed, and the code does not produce the correct permutation \( p \).
