Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). However, upon closer inspection, the program does not correctly implement the logic to generate a valid permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically:

1. The program initializes `mex` and iterates through the array `arr`. For each element in `arr`, it tries to calculate the MEX value.
2. The logic for calculating the MEX value is flawed. The program incorrectly updates `minn` and `maxx` without properly considering the constraints and requirements of the MEX calculation.
3. The program directly prints the values in `mex` without ensuring that the resulting permutation \( p \) meets the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
