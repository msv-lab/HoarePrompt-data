Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is an empty list, `maxx` is 0.**

The code initializes `maxx` to 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
