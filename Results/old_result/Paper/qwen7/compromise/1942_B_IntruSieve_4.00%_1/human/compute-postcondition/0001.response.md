Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking input from the user, splitting the input string into individual elements using `split()`, and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
