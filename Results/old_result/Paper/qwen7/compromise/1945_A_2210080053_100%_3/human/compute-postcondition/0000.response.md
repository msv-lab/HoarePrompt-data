Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop iterates over the lines read from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`.
   - The variable `s` is used to store each line as it is read.

2. **Determine the initial state:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means there are `t` test cases.
   - Each test case consists of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).

3. **Understand the loop execution:**
   - The loop reads `t` lines from standard input.
   - Each line `s` contains three space-separated integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute:**
   - Since the loop reads lines from standard input, the initial state of `s` is not defined. We need to ensure that there are `t` lines available for reading.
   - The value of `t` must be set correctly to ensure the loop runs `t` times.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` should be set to a value within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- There must be exactly `t` lines of input available for reading.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and there are exactly `t` lines of input available for reading.**
