You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it updates the number of extroverts by adding the number of universals and then calculates and prints the number of valid seating arrangements based on the adjusted number of extroverts and introverts. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated values for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the allocation of tents for introverts, extroverts, and universals. Specifically, the program incorrectly combines the number of extroverts and universals before attempting to allocate tents. This approach fails to consider the specific needs of introverts who require individual tents.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 2 3` (1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 3 universals)

According to the problem description:
- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal (since 2 extroverts can share a tent with 1 universal).
- 1 additional tent for the remaining 2 universals.

So, the total number of tents required is 3.

However, the program attempts to combine the number of extroverts and universals before allocating tents. Here's how it fails:
- `(a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3)`
- `b += c` results in `b = 5`
- `(a - -b // 3)` calculates `1 - -5 // 3`, which simplifies to `1 - -1 = 2` (incorrect).

Thus, the program outputs 2 instead of 3, indicating it does not correctly allocate the tents as per the problem description.
