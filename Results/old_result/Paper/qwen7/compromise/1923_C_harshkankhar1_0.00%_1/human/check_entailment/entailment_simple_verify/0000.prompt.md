You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; the array c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')

The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the loop executes all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not check if the subarray can be transformed into another array \(b\) that satisfies the conditions:

1. \(\sum_{i=l}^{r} a_i = \sum_{i=l}^{r} b_i\)
2. \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\) from \(l\) to \(r\)
3. \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\) from \(l\) to \(r\)

The program calculates prefix sums and prints them, but it does not actually check if the subarray can be transformed into another array \(b\) that meets the required conditions. Instead, it incorrectly checks if the sum of the subarray matches the sum of the prefix sums, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is good.

For example, consider the subarray \([1, 2, 1, 4, 5]\) from indices 1 to 5. This subarray is good because we can transform it into \([2, 1, 3, 4, 5]\), which satisfies all the conditions. However, the program would incorrectly print "NO" for this subarray because it does not properly check the transformation condition.
