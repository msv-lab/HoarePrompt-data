Output State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (up to 2^(l-2))], `n` is not equal to 2.

In this output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain the initial values `[2, 3]` plus additional powers of 2 starting from `2^2` up to `2^(l-2)`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `l-1`, appending `2 ** i` to `ans` for each iteration, where `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `l-1`.
