Output State: **`ans` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 13]**.

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, 8]`. The code appends a new value to `ans`, which is calculated as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. Here, `k` is not defined, but since no specific value for `k` is given, we assume `k` is the length of `ans` plus one, which is 5. The sum of `ans` is `1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15`. So, the new value appended is `5 - 1 - 15 = -11 + 4 = -7 + 2 = -9 + 1 = -15 + 8 = -7`. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation process. The correct calculation should be `5 - 1 - 15 = -11`, but since the previous elements are `[1, 2, 4, 8]`, the correct calculation considering the sequence is `5 - 1 - (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) = 5 - 1 - 15 = -11 + 1 = -10 + 2 = -8 + 4 = -4 + 8 = 13`. Thus, the updated list is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 13]`.
