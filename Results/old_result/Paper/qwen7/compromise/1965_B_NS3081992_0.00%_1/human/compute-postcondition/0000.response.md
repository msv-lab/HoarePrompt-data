State: **`func_10` must return at least 1, `func_14` must return an integer representing the size of the sequence for each test case, `_` is now 1** 

### Explanation:
- The loop `for _ in range(func_10()):` will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_10()` must return at least 1.
- The variable `_` is a common placeholder used in Python for loop indices when the value of the index is not needed. In this context, it is initialized to 0 before the loop starts and will be incremented with each iteration.
- The function `func_14` is mentioned but not directly involved in the loop condition. However, it is expected to return an integer representing the size of the sequence for each test case, which might be relevant for the loop body but not necessary for the loop to execute.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are ensuring that `func_10()` returns at least 1 (to allow the loop to execute) and that `func_14` returns an integer representing the size of the sequence for each test case (though this is more relevant for the loop body).
