Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions**: The program defines several functions (`func_1` to `func_15`), but only `func_10` and `func_14` seem to be relevant to solving the problem. The rest appear to be either placeholders or not directly related to the problem.
2. **Relevant Functions**:
   - `func_10`: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - `func_14`: Generates a sequence based on the given `n` and `k` according to the problem requirements.
3. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to generate a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence with a sum of `k`.
   - For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there should be a subsequence with a sum of `v`.
4. **Function `func_14` Implementation**:
   - If `k == 1`, it generates a sequence starting from 2, 3, and powers of 2 up to `2^(l-2)`.
   - If `k > 1`, it generates a sequence starting from 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and powers of 2 up to `2^(l-2)`.
   - These sequences satisfy the conditions of the problem:
     - No subsequence sums to `k`.
     - All numbers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

Given that `func_14` correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence based on the problem statement, and `func_15` correctly calls `func_14` for each test case, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
