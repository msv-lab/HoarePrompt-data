Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where both rows have a '1' at the same position, which should contribute to the lexicographically smallest string. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
2
3
110
011
4
0000
0000
```

The expected output should be:
```
000
2
000
4
```

However, the program will produce the following incorrect output:
```
110
1
000
1
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where both rows have a '1' at the same position, leading to an incorrect lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths.
