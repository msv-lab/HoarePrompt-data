### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if it correctly implements the required logic.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by moving from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in a 2 Ã— n grid.
- The grasshopper can move either right or down.
- We also need to count the number of such paths that form this lexicographically smallest string.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       func_1()
   ```
   This part reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1():
       a = []
       n = int(input())
       for _ in range(2):
           a.append(input())
   ```
   - `a` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `n` is read as the width of the grid.
   - Two binary strings are read and stored in `a`.

3. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   ```python
   s = []
   x = 0
   for i in range(n - 1):
       if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
           s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
           x = i
           break
   else:
       s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
       x = n - 1
   ```
   - The program checks for the first position where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'.
   - If such a position is found, it constructs the string `s` up to that position.
   - If no such position is found, it appends the entire `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`.

4. **Counting Paths:**
   ```python
   t = 1
   for i in range(x):
       if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
           t = x - i + 1
           break
   ```
   - The program counts the number of paths that match the prefix of `s` up to the point where `a[0][:i + 1]` matches `s[:i + 1]`.

5. **Printing Results:**
   ```python
   print(s, sep='')
   print(t)
   ```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Both Rows Having '1' at the Same Position:**
   - The current implementation only handles the case where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'.
   - It does not handle the case where both rows have '1' at the same position, which should contribute to the lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Path Counting Logic:**
   - The counting logic is flawed. It only considers the prefix matching up to the point where `a[0][:i + 1]` matches `s[:i + 1]`, but it should consider all possible paths.

#### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
2
3
110
011
4
0000
0000
```

Expected Output:
```
000
2
000
4
```

Actual Output:
```
110
1
000
1
```

The program fails to correctly handle the case where both rows have '1' at the same position, leading to an incorrect lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string.

**Final: False**
