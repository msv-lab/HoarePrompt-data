Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `letters`. This does not affect the values of `password` or `digits`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `letters` and retains the original values of `password` and `digits`.
