The code `letters.sort()` sorts the `letters` list in ascending order. Since the `letters` list originally contained all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the original `password` string, sorting it will arrange these letters alphabetically. The `digits` list remains unchanged, and the `password` variable itself does not change. Therefore, the output state is: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the original `password` string sorted in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the original `password` string, now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the original `password` string sorted in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the original `password` string, now sorted in ascending order.**
