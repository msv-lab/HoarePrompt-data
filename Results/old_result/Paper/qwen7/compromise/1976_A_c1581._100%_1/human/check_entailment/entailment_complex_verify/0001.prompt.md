You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: Output State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the original `password` string.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the original `password` string sorted in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the original `password` string, now sorted in ascending order; both `digits` and `letters` lists satisfy the conditions that no two consecutive elements in `digits` are out of order and the last element in `digits` is not greater than any element in `letters`.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. It separates the digits and letters into two lists, sorts them individually, and then checks if the sorted combination of these lists matches the original password. If the sorted combination matches the original password, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.
3. It then calls `func_1(password)` to check if the password meets the criteria.
4. In `func_1(password)`, it separates the characters into two lists: one for digits and one for letters.
5. It sorts both lists.
6. It checks if any digit is greater than the next digit (ensuring digits are in non-decreasing order).
7. It also checks if any letter is greater than the last digit (ensuring letters come after digits, if at all present).
8. After sorting the digits and letters separately, it concatenates them and compares the result with the original password.
9. If the concatenated and sorted version matches the original password, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement:
- Digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- There are no digits after letters.

Given this analysis, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
