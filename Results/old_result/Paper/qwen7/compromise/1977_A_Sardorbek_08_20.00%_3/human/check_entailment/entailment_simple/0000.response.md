### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then processes each test case.
   - It splits the input for each test case into `b` and `c`, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.

2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - The program checks if `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes). If they are equal, it prints "YES".
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints "NO" because it's not possible to add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - There is an additional condition where it checks if `a % 2 == b % 2`. However, this condition is not relevant to the problem statement since `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves `b`.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" in lowercase, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Given Program:

- The program does not handle the case where `b` is greater than `c` and the difference between `b` and `c` is even. This means that if `b > c` and the difference is even, the program incorrectly prints "No" instead of checking if it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes by removing cubes from the top.
- The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is irrelevant to the problem and should be removed.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where `b > c` and the difference is even, which should still be possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

### Correctness:
**False**
