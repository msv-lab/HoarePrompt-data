Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop from `0` to `a-1`.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - This part is correct as it matches the problem requirement of reading `n` and `m`.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
     - **Condition 1:** `if b == c:`
       - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the program prints 'YES'. 
       - This condition is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, and each move adds one cube, it is possible to achieve the desired state.
     - **Condition 2:** `elif b < c:`
       - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints 'NO'.
       - This condition is incorrect because even if `b < c`, it is still possible to add cubes to reach `c` if we consider adding and removing cubes. For example, if `b = 1` and `c = 2`, it is possible to add another cube to make `c = 2`.
     - **Condition 3:** `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`
       - This condition checks if `a` (number of moves) and `b` (desired number of cubes) have the same parity (both even or both odd).
       - This condition is incorrect because it does not fully cover all scenarios where it is possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves. For example, if `b = 3` and `c = 2`, `b` is odd and `c` is even, but it is still possible to achieve `c = 2` by adding and removing cubes appropriately.
     - **Condition 4:** `else:`
       - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NO'.
       - This condition is also incorrect because it does not handle cases where it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, as each move can either add or remove one cube. Therefore, the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference should match.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains logical errors in its condition checking. Based on the corrected logic, the program should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
