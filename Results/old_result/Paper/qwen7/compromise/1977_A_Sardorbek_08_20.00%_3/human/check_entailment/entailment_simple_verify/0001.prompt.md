You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration from 0 to a-1. The specific sequence of outputs depends on the values of b and c entered during each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes respectively.
3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the program prints 'YES'. This condition is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, and each move adds one cube, the result is a tower with `c` cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints 'NO'. This condition is also correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves if each move adds one cube.
   - The conditions `if a % 2 == b % 2:` and `else:` are incorrect. The variable `a` is already used to store the number of test cases, not the number of moves (`b`). Also, the logic here is flawed. The parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves does not directly determine whether it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

Given the analysis, the program incorrectly handles the logic for determining if it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes. Specifically, the conditions involving the parity of `a` and `b` are not relevant and do not correctly solve the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
