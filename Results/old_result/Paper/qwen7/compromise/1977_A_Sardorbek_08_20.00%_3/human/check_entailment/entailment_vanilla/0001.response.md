Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes respectively.
3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the program prints 'YES'. This condition is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, and each move adds one cube, the result is a tower with `c` cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints 'NO'. This condition is also correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves if each move adds one cube.
   - The conditions `if a % 2 == b % 2:` and `else:` are incorrect. The variable `a` is already used to store the number of test cases, not the number of moves (`b`). Also, the logic here is flawed. The parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves does not directly determine whether it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

Given the analysis, the program incorrectly handles the logic for determining if it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes. Specifically, the conditions involving the parity of `a` and `b` are not relevant and do not correctly solve the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
