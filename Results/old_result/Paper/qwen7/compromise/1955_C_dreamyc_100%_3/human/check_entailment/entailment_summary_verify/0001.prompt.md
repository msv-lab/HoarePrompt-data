You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    (a, b) = (math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2)
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` represents the number of integers in the list `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns either the number of integers `n` in the list `nums` or the count of indices `i` for which the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `k // 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a series of ships with varying durability. The Kraken attacks in a specific pattern: first the first ship, then the last, and repeats this process until it runs out of attacks (`k`).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the durability of each ship into the list `nums`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the total durability of all ships. If so, it returns `n` because all ships will be sunk.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of attacks on the first half (`a`) and the second half (`b`) of the ships.
   - It then iterates through the list of ships, counting how many ships can withstand the attacks from both ends without sinking.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic for counting the number of ships that can withstand the attacks might be flawed. Specifically, the current implementation counts the number of ships that can withstand at least one attack from either end, which doesn't accurately simulate the Kraken's attack sequence.
   - The function should simulate the actual attack sequence where the first and last ships are targeted alternately.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Simulate the attack sequence by iterating through the list and reducing the durability of the targeted ships.
   - Keep track of the number of sunk ships and stop when there are no more ships left to attack.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack sequence and will likely produce incorrect results.
