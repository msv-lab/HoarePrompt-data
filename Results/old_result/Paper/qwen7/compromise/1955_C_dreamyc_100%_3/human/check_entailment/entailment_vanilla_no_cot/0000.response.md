Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Durability Reduction**: The program calculates the total sum of the durability values and checks if `k` is greater than or equal to this sum. If so, it assumes all ships will sink, which is not necessarily true because the Kraken attacks in a specific alternating pattern (first, last, first, etc.), and ships can sink before the total durability is reduced to zero.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Sunk Ships**: The function `func_1` attempts to count the number of ships that would be sunk by calculating the cumulative sums from both ends (`s_a` and `s_b`). However, this approach does not accurately reflect the Kraken's attack pattern and the sinking condition of the ships.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks, we need to keep track of the durability of each ship and apply the attacks in the specified order until either all ships sink or the number of attacks reaches `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    queue = deque(range(n))
    attacks = 0
    sunk_ships = 0

    while queue and attacks < k:
        if queue[0] != -1:
            nums[queue[0]] -= 1
            if nums[queue[0]] == 0:
                sunk_ships += 1
                queue[0] = -1
        if queue and queue[-1] != -1:
            nums[queue[-1]] -= 1
            if nums[queue[-1]] == 0:
                sunk_ships += 1
                queue[-1] = -1
        attacks += 1

    print(sunk_ships)
```

This corrected program uses a deque to manage the indices of the ships and applies the Kraken's attacks in the specified order, updating the durability of the ships and counting the number of sunk ships accordingly.
