Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns either the number of integers `n` in the list `nums` or the sum of all indices `i` for which either the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `k // 2`.**
