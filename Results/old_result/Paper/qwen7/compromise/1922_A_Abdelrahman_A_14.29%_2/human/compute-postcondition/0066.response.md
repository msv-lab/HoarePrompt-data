Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to the length of the original `c` + 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is an empty string, and `no` is False. Since the condition `if (no):` is false, no changes are made to the variables.**
