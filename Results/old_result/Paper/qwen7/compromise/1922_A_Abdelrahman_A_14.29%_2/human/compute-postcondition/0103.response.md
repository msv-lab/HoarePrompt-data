Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of strings), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`). For each test case, it checks if any character in `c` is present in either `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if any character in `c` is not present in both `a` and `b`. If such a character exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each test case.**
