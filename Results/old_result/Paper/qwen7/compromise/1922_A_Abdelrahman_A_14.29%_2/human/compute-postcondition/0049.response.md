Output State: **`no` is False, tests must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to the length of `c` + 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the new input string, the character `x` is not present in `a` and `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
