Output State: **`x` is an integer not present in either list `a` or `b`; `no` is False**

Explanation: The variable `no` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The initial state of `x` and the conditions regarding lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `no` and retains the original conditions for `x`.
