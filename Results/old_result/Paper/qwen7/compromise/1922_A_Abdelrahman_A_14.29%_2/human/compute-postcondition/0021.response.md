Output State: **`c` must contain at least one element, and `x` is an element in `c`; `no` is False**

Explanation: The variable `no` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The initial conditions for `c` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `no` and retains the original conditions for `c` and `x`.
