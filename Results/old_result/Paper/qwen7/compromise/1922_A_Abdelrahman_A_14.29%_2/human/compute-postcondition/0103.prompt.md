You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `tests` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed (which is the value of `tests`), `slength` remains the same as the initial input integer, `a` remains the same as the last input string, `b` remains the same as the last input string, `c` remains the same as the last input string, and `no` will be `False` if any character in `c` is found in either `a` or `b`. If no character in `c` is found in both `a` and `b`, then `no` will remain `True`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `tests` will hold the final value it had after the last iteration, `i` will reflect the total number of iterations (`tests`), and `no` will indicate whether there was any character in `c` that was not present in either `a` or `b` during any of the iterations. The values of `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those provided in the last set of inputs processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function returns information based on the values of t, n, and the strings a, b, and c.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
