Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `tests` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed (which is the value of `tests`), `slength` remains the same as the initial input integer, `a` remains the same as the last input string, `b` remains the same as the last input string, `c` remains the same as the last input string, and `no` will be `False` if any character in `c` is found in either `a` or `b`. If no character in `c` is found in both `a` and `b`, then `no` will remain `True`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `tests` will hold the final value it had after the last iteration, `i` will reflect the total number of iterations (`tests`), and `no` will indicate whether there was any character in `c` that was not present in either `a` or `b` during any of the iterations. The values of `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those provided in the last set of inputs processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of strings), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`). For each test case, it checks if any character in `c` is present in either `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if any character in `c` is not present in both `a` and `b`. If such a character exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each test case.
