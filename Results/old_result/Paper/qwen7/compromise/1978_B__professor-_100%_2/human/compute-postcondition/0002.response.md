Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each test case. For each test case, the output will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` as follows:
- If `b <= a`, the output will be `n * a`.
- If `b - a >= n`, the output will be the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2b - n + 1` divided by 2.
- Otherwise, the output will be the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers plus `a * n`.
