Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each test case. For each test case, if \( b \leq a \), it will print \( n \times a \). If \( b - a \geq n \), it will print \( \frac{(2 \times b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \). Otherwise, it will print \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \).

This output state represents the result of processing each test case according to the given conditions and calculations within the loop.
