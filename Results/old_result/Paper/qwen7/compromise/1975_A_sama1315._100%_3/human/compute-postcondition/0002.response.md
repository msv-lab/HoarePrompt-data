Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The line `idx = 0` initializes the variable `idx` to 0. The initial conditions for `t`, `input`, and `data` remain unchanged.
