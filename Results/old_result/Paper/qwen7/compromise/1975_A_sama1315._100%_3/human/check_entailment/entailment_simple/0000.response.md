### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The provided solution uses a different approach by checking if the array can be split and reordered to match its sorted form by concatenating it with itself.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function takes an array `a` and checks if it can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by finding a valid split point.
   - It does this by comparing subarrays of the concatenated array `a + a` with the sorted version of `a`.
   - If a subarray of `a + a` matches the sorted version of `a`, it means the original array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input format and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and storing the results.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. By checking if any subarray of `a + a` matches the sorted version of `a`, it effectively determines if the array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
