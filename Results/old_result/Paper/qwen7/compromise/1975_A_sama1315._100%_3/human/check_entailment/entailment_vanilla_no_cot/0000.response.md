Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by checking if any rotation of the array matches a sorted version of the array. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the specific operation defined in the problem, which involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is less than or equal to the second part when concatenated in reverse order. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n):
        left = a[:i]
        right = a[i:]
        if left + right == sorted(left + right):
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This solution correctly checks if the array can be split into two parts and swapped to form a non-decreasing sequence.
