Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The key issue lies in the condition used to determine the winner. According to the problem, the game is played optimally, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. However, the program incorrectly determines the winner based solely on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd.

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of coins each player has. Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The program assumes that if the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is not aligned with the optimal strategy for the game.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: In the optimal strategy, the player with an odd number of coins will always win because they can force the other player into a losing position. Specifically, if a player has an odd number of coins, they can always ensure that after their move, the other player will be left with an even number of coins, thus putting them in a losing position.

Given the correct logic, the program should check if either `a` or `b` is odd. If at least one of them is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 != 0 or b % 2 != 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
