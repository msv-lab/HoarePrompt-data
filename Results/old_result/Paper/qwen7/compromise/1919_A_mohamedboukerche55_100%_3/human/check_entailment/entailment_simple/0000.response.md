Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The logic in the function `func()` checks whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly. However, the actual outcome of the game depends on the optimal strategy of the players, not just the parity of the sum of their coins.

To understand the correct solution, we need to analyze the game more deeply:
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, the player holding 1 coin will lose because they will be forced to swap and then be left with 0 coins, which is an invalid state.
- For any other values of `a` and `b`, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position by swapping and reducing the opponent's coins by 1, ensuring that the opponent is eventually left with 1 coin.

Given this, the correct approach is to check if either `a` or `b` is 1. If either is 1, the player holding 1 will lose. Otherwise, the player whose turn it is will always win by forcing the opponent into a losing position.

The provided code does not implement this logic correctly. It simply checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`, which is not relevant to determining the winner based on the optimal strategy.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
