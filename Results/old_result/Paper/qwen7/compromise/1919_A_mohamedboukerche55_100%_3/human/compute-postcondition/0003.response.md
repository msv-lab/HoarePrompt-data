Output State: The output state will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed for each iteration based on whether the sum of the first two integers in each input string is even or odd. Specifically, if the sum is even, 'Bob' will be printed; otherwise, 'Alice' will be printed. The exact sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' depends on the input provided for each iteration of the loop.
