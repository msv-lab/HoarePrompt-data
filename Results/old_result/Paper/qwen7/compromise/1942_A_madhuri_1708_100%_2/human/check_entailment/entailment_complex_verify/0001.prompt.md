You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case:
    #- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, it will print a line with `k` repeated `k` times.
    #- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, it will print `-1`.
    #- If `k` is less than 2, it will print a line with numbers from 1 to `n`.
    #
    #Each line's content depends on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \):
- If \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n = k \), it prints a line containing the integer \( k \) repeated \( k \) times.
- If \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \), it prints `-1`.
- If \( k < 2 \), it prints a line containing the integers from 1 to \( n \).

After processing all test cases, the function outputs multiple lines of text, each corresponding to a test case according to the specified conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case from standard input.
   - It reads the values of \(n\) and \(k\) from the input string.
   - It checks if \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), it prints a sequence where all elements are equal to \(k\).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - For \(k < 2\), it prints a sequence where elements are \(1, 2, \ldots, n\).

3. **Checking Validity of the Solution:**
   - **Case 1: \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\):**
     - If \(n = k\), the solution prints `[k, k, ..., k]`. This array has exactly \(n\) cyclic shifts, all of which are sorted.
     - This is correct because every cyclic shift of this array will be identical to the original array, hence sorted.
   
   - **Case 2: \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\):**
     - The solution prints `-1`, indicating that no such array exists. This is correct because if \(n \neq k\), it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts with \(n\) elements.
   
   - **Case 3: \(k < 2\):**
     - The solution prints `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).
     - This is incorrect because we need exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts, and for \(k = 1\), the only sorted cyclic shift is the original array, but for \(k = 0\), no cyclic shift can be sorted.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution correctly handles the cases where \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\), and correctly outputs `-1` when \(n \neq k\).
   - However, for \(k < 2\), the solution does not provide the correct answer since it doesn't account for the requirement of having exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the cases where \(k < 2\).
