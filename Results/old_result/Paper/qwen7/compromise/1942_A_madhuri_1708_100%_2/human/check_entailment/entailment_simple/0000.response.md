### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)
     - The program checks if \( k \geq 2 \). Since \( k = 2 \), it proceeds to check if \( n = k \). Here, \( n = k = 2 \), so it prints `[2, 2]`. This is correct because both cyclic shifts `[2, 2]` are sorted.
   - **Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - The program checks if \( k \geq 2 \). Since \( k = 1 \), it falls into the else block and prints `[1, 2, 3]`. This is correct because only one cyclic shift `[1, 2, 3]` is sorted.
   - **Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 2 \)
     - The program checks if \( k \geq 2 \). Since \( k = 2 \), it proceeds to check if \( n = k \). Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \), so it prints `-1`. This is correct because there is no way to arrange the elements such that exactly 2 out of 3 cyclic shifts are sorted.

2. **General Logic**:
   - When \( k \geq 2 \):
     - If \( n = k \), the program prints a sequence where every element is the same, ensuring all cyclic shifts are sorted.
     - If \( n \neq k \), the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts when \( n \neq k \).
   - When \( k < 2 \):
     - The program prints a sequence from 1 to \( n \), ensuring that at least one cyclic shift is sorted.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases like \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 1 \) (which would fall under \( k < 2 \)).
   - It also correctly handles cases where \( n \) and \( k \) are larger but the constraints are met as described.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected outputs for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
