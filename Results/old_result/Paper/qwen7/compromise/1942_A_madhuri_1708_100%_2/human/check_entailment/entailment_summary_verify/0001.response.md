### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case from standard input.
   - It reads the values of \(n\) and \(k\) from the input string.
   - It checks if \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), it prints a sequence where all elements are equal to \(k\).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - For \(k < 2\), it prints a sequence where elements are \(1, 2, \ldots, n\).

3. **Checking Validity of the Solution:**
   - **Case 1: \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\):**
     - If \(n = k\), the solution prints `[k, k, ..., k]`. This array has exactly \(n\) cyclic shifts, all of which are sorted.
     - This is correct because every cyclic shift of this array will be identical to the original array, hence sorted.
   
   - **Case 2: \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\):**
     - The solution prints `-1`, indicating that no such array exists. This is correct because if \(n \neq k\), it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts with \(n\) elements.
   
   - **Case 3: \(k < 2\):**
     - The solution prints `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).
     - This is incorrect because we need exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts, and for \(k = 1\), the only sorted cyclic shift is the original array, but for \(k = 0\), no cyclic shift can be sorted.

4. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function:
     - If \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\), it prints a sequence where all elements are \(k\).
     - If \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\), it prints `-1`.
     - If \(k < 2\), it prints a sequence where elements are \(1, 2, \ldots, n\).

5. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The function summary aligns with the implementation of the function.
   - The function correctly handles the cases where \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\), and correctly outputs `-1` when \(n \neq k\).
   - However, for \(k < 2\), the function does not provide the correct answer since it does not account for the requirement of having exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the solution for \(k < 2\). The function does not correctly handle these cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final:
**False**
