Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within each test case where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. It returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to process pairs of integers `(n, k)` within specified ranges and return a value (though the specific return value is not detailed in the given information) based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.
