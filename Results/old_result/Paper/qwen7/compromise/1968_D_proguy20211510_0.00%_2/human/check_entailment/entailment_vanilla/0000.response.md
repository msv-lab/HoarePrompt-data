Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. It also correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**: The function checks if both players start with the maximum value in the array `a`. If both players start with the maximum value, it prints 'Draw'. This is correct because in this case, both players will have the same score if they follow the optimal strategy.

3. **Single Maximum Value Check**: The function checks if either player starts with the maximum value in the array `a`. If one player starts with the maximum value, it prints 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' accordingly. This is correct because the player starting with the maximum value will always have a higher score if they stay at their initial position for all turns.

4. **Dynamic Score Calculation**: The function calculates the scores for both players using a dynamic approach. It iterates through the turns and updates the scores based on the current position and the maximum value in the array `a`. This part is more complex and involves calculating potential scores considering the possibility of moving to the next position in the permutation.

5. **Final Score Comparison**: After calculating the potential scores, the function compares the final scores of both players and prints the result accordingly. This part is correct because it considers all possible moves and calculates the maximum possible score for each player.

Given the above reasoning, the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
