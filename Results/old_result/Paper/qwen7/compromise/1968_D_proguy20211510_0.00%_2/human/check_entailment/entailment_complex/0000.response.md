Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for each test case, reading the values of \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \), followed by the permutation \( p \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Initial Conditions Check**: The program correctly checks if the maximum value in \( a \) is at both \( P_B \) and \( P_S \). If so, it prints 'Draw'. This part is handled correctly.

3. **Dynamic Position Tracking**: The program tracks the positions of Bodya and Sasha using the permutation \( p \) correctly. This is crucial for calculating their scores accurately.

4. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the scores for both players over \( k \) turns. It uses the cumulative sums `preb` and `pres` to efficiently compute the total scores. The logic for updating the scores based on the maximum value in \( a \) and the positions tracked is sound.

5. **Final Comparison**: The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ('Sasha', 'Bodya', or 'Draw'). This is done correctly based on the computed scores.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
