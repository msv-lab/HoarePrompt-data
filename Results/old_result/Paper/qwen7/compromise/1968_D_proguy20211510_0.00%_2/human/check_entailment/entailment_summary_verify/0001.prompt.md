You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \), a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \), and an array \( a \) of positive integers. For each test case, it determines the winner between Sasha and Bodya based on the values in \( a \) at specific indices and their permutations. If the maximum value in \( a \) is at both specified indices, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sums of points for Sasha and Bodya over \( k \) iterations, considering the permutations and the maximum value in \( a \). Finally, it prints 'Sasha' if her cumulative points are higher, 'Bodya' if his are higher, or 'Draw' if they are equal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. It also correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**: The function checks if both players start with the maximum value in the array `a`. If both players start with the maximum value, it prints 'Draw'. This is correct because in this case, both players will have the same score if they follow the optimal strategy.

3. **Single Maximum Value Check**: The function checks if either player starts with the maximum value in the array `a`. If one player starts with the maximum value, it prints 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' accordingly. This is correct because the player starting with the maximum value will always have a higher score if they stay at their initial position for all turns.

4. **Dynamic Score Calculation**: The function calculates the scores for both players using a dynamic approach. It iterates through the turns and updates the scores based on the current position and the maximum value in the array `a`. This part is more complex and involves calculating potential scores considering the possibility of moving to the next position in the permutation.

5. **Final Score Comparison**: After calculating the potential scores, the function compares the final scores of both players and prints the result accordingly. This part is correct because it considers all possible moves and calculates the maximum possible score for each player.

Given the above reasoning, the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.
