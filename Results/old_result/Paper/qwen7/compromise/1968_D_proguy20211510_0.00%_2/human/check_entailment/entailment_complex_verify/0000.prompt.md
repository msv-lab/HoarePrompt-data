You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is determined by the final values of `maxs` and `maxb`. These values represent the maximum cumulative sums of the points for Sasha (`ptss`) and Bodya (`ptsb`) respectively, considering the contributions from the arrays `b` and `s` up to the last iteration. 
    #
    #The final decision on who wins ('Sasha', 'Bodya', or 'Draw') is made based on the comparison between `maxs` and `maxb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, Sasha wins. If `maxb` is greater than `maxs`, Bodya wins. If they are equal, it results in a draw.
    #
    #The cumulative sums `preb` and `pres` are calculated for arrays `b` and `s` respectively, and these are used to compute `ptsb` and `ptss` which are then compared to determine the winner. The loop processes up to `k` iterations, updating the positions `pb` and `ps` based on the permutation `p` until the conditions for `founds` and `foundb` are met, or the loop completes its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \), a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \), and an array \( a \) of positive integers. For each test case, it determines the winner between Sasha and Bodya based on the values in \( a \) at specific indices and their permutations. If the maximum value in \( a \) is at both specified indices, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sums of points for Sasha and Bodya over \( k \) iterations, considering the permutations and the maximum value in \( a \). Finally, it prints 'Sasha' if her cumulative points are higher, 'Bodya' if his are higher, or 'Draw' if they are equal.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not account for all possible moves and scores for both players over the k turns. Instead, it makes assumptions about the maximum value in the array `a` and the initial positions of Bodya and Sasha, which do not cover all scenarios.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `pb = 1`, `ps = 3`
- `p = [2, 3, 1]`
- `a = [1, 10, 1]`

In this case, Bodya starts at position 1, and Sasha starts at position 3. The permutation and array `a` are such that Bodya can potentially get a higher score by moving to different positions, and Sasha can also move to different positions to maximize her score.

The program fails to properly simulate all possible moves and calculate the scores accurately for both players over the k turns. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
