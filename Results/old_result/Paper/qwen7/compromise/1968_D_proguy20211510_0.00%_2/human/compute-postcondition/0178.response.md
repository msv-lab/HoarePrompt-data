Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains an element which is `(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa`, `s` contains an element which is `(k - (1 + 1)) * maxa`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `foundb`, `founds`, `b`, and `s`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
