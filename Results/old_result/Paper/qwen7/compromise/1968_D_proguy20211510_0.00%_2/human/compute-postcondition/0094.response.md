Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with five elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with five elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\) if `foundb` is True, or \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1] or a[pb - 1] if pb is used instead of ps]\) if `foundb` is False, and `b` is appended with `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends `maxa` to the list `b`. Since `b` originally had five elements, after appending `maxa`, it now has six elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
