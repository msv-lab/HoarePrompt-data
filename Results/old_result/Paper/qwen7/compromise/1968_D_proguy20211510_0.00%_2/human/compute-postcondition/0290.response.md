Output State: **`ptsb` now contains the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` and the additional element from the append operation, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptss` now contains the new elements `pres[i+1] + rem * s[i+1]`, `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, and the new element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to `ptss`, which is `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. The values of `ptsb` and `rem` remain unchanged. Therefore, `ptss` now includes the previously mentioned elements along with the newly appended element.
