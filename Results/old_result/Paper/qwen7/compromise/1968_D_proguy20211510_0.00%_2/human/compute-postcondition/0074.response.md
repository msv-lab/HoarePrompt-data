The code `foundb = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `foundb`. This assignment does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the only change is that `foundb` is now `True`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with three elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with three elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, and `foundb` is True.**
