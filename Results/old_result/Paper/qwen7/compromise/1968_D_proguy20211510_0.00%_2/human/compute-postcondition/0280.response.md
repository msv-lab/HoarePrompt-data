Output State: **`ptsb` now contains the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. This new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, where `rem` is defined as `k - (i + 1)`. The values of `preb`, `b`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
