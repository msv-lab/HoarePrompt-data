Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains an element which is `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given that `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, `b` now contains two elements: `(k - 1) * maxa` and `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
