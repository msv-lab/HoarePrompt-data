The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with three elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with three elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa**.
