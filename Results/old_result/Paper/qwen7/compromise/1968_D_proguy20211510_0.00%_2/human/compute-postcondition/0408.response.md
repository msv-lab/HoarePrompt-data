Output State: **`i` is 9; `pres` is updated to include `ss + s[8]`.**

Explanation: The code `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Given that `i` was initially 8, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 9. The value of `pres` is updated to include the new element `ss + s[8]`.
