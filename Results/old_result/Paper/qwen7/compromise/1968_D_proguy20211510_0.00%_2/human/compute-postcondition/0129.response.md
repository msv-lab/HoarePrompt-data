Output State: **`i` is `k^2`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `s` multiplied by `k`, `ss` is the same as `pres`, `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb` plus each element of `b` from index `k+1` to `k^2-1`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty lists, `ptsb` and `ptss`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`i`, `len(s)`, `sb`, `pres`, `ss`, `preb`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
