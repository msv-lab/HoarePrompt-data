Output State: **`i` is 3; `preb` is a list containing the string `sb + b[0]`; `sb` is equal to `sb + b[1]`; `pres` is a list containing the string `ss + s[i-1]`; `ss` is `ss + s[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by appending the character `s[i]` (which is `s[2]` since `i` is 3) to `ss`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
