Output State: **`i` is `k+2`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is `sb + b[i-1]`, `pres` is `ss + s[k+1]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k+1]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[i-1]]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `sb += b[i]` increments the value of `sb` by `b[i]`. Given that `i` is initially `k+2`, the effective index used in the list `b` is `i-1`, which is `k+1`. Therefore, `sb` is updated to `sb + b[k+1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
