Postcondition: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `a[ps - 1]` and both are equal to `maxa`, then the condition holds. Otherwise, `a[pb - 1]` is either not equal to `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `a[ps - 1]` and at least one of them is not equal to `maxa`.**
