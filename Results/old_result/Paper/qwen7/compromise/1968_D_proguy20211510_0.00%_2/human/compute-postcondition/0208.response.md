Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is False, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to be the value of `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
