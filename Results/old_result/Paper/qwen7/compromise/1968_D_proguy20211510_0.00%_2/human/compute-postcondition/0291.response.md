Output State: `ptsb` now contains all the elements generated by the loop, which are `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres)-1`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)` for each iteration, `ptss` now contains all the elements generated by the loop, which are `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres)-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ptsb` will contain a list where each element is calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for every index `i` from 0 to the length of `pres` minus one. Similarly, `ptss` will contain a list where each element is calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for every index `i` from 0 to the length of `pres` minus one. The values of `rem` will be `k - (i + 1)` for each iteration `i`.
