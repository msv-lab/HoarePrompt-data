Postcondition: **`maxs` is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `pres` from index 3 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `s`; `maxb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `preb` from index 1 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `b`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb` in the if part, `maxs` remains the maximum value. Otherwise, `maxb` remains the maximum value.**

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that either `maxs` or `maxb` retains its status as the maximum value based on the condition evaluated within the if statement.
