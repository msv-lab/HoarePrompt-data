Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
