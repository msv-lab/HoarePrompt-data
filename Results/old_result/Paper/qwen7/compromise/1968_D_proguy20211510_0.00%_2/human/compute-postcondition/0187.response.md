Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains an element which is `(k - 1) * maxa`, and `s` contains an element which is `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code sets `foundb` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
