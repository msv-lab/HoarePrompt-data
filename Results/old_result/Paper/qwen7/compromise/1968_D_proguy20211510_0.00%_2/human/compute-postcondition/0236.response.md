Output State: **`b` is updated by appending the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to it.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `b`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Since the initial values of `k`, `i`, and `maxa` are not specified, we express the new element in terms of these variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
