Postcondition: `i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and an additional element `(k - 4) * maxa`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa`, the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and an additional element `(k - 4) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
