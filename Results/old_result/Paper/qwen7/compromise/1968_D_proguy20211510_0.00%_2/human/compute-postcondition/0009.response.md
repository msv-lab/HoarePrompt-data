Postcondition: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`. The current value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to the current value of `a[ps - 1]`, and both are equal to the current value of `maxa`.
