Output State: **`i` is less than k^2, `len(s)` is k^2, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `s` multiplied by `k`, `ss` is the same as `pres`, `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb` plus each element of `b` from index `k+1` to `k^2-1`, `ptsb` is a list containing one element which is preb[i] + rem * b[i], `ptss` is a list containing the value pres[i] + rem * s[i], `rem` is k - (i + 1)**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` to the list `ptss`. Since `pres` is the sum of all elements in `s` multiplied by `k`, and `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, the new value of `ptss` is a list containing the calculated value. The other variables remain unchanged.
