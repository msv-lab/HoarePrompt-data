Output State: **`ptsb` now contains the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptss` now contains the new elements `pres[i+1] + rem * s[i+1]` and `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `rem` is reassigned to the value of `k - (i + 1)`. The other variables (`ptsb`, `preb`, `rem`, `ptss`, `pres`, `s`) retain their previous values or the relationships between them as described in the initial state.
