Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` to `False`. No other changes are made to the existing variables, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
