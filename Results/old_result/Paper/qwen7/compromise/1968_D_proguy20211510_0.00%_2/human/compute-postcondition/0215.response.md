Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`, and `b` now includes an additional element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]` and `s` now includes an additional element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**

This means that the list `s` has had an additional element appended to it, which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. All other variables retain their previous states.
