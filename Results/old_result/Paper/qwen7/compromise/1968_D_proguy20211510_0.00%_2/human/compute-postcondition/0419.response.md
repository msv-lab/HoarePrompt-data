Output State: **`i` is 2; `rem` is `k - 1`; `ptsb` contains the value `preb[1] + (k - 1) * b[1]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` to the list `ptsb`. Given that `i` is initially 1 and `rem` is `k - 1`, the value appended to `ptsb` is `preb[1] + (k - 1) * b[1]`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `rem` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the given code snippet.
