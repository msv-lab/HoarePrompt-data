Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is False, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\), and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
