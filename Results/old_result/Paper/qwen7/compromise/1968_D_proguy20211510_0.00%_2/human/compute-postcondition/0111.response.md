Output State: **`preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `i` will be equal to `k`, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` will be a list containing `k * maxa` repeated `k` times, `b` will be a list containing the first element of `a` followed by `k-1` instances of `maxa`, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0.**

The code initializes two new variables `sb` and `ss` to 0. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`preb`, `pres`, `i`, `founds`, `s`, `b`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while updating `sb` and `ss` to 0.
