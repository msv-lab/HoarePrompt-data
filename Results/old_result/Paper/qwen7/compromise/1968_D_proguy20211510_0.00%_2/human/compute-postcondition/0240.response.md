Postcondition: `b` and `s` are lists. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, then `b` and `s` each contain the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to their respective lists, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If either `foundb` or `founds` is false, no changes are made to `b` and `s`, and the loops continue as normal.
