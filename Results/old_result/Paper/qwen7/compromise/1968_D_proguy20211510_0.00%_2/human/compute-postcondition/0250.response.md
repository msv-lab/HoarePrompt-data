Output State: **`b` is unchanged, `s` contains the value `maxa` appended to it, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `maxa` to the list `s`. The conditions related to `b` and `foundb` are not met, so `b` remains unchanged. Additionally, since `a[pb - 1]` does not need to be checked against `maxa` for appending to `b`, the value of `a[pb - 1]` is appended to `b` only if it was previously determined to be equal to `maxa` and `foundb` was True, which is not the case here. Instead, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
