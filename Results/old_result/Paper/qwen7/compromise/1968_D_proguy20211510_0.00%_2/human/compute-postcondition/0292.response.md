Output State: `ptsb` now contains `len(pres)` elements, each calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` where `rem` is `k - (i + 1)` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`. Similarly, `ptss` now contains `len(pres)` elements, each calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` where `rem` is `k - (i + 1)` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ptsb` will have a list with one element for each index `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, where each element is the sum of `preb[i]` and `rem * b[i]` with `rem` being `k - (i + 1)`. Likewise, `ptss` will also have a list with one element for each index `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, where each element is the sum of `pres[i]` and `rem * s[i]` with `rem` again being `k - (i + 1)`.
