Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is False, `founds` is True, `b` contains an element which is `(k - 1) * maxa`, and `s` contains an element which is `(k - 2) * maxa`, and the condition `(a[pb - 1] != maxa)` holds true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
