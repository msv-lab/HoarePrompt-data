Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer converted from the first input value minus 1.
- `k` is an integer converted from the second input value.
- `pb` is an integer converted from the third input value.
- `ps` is an integer converted from the fourth input value.
- `maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the next input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Sasha'`. Since no variables or objects are being referenced in this print statement, it will directly print the string as is.

Output: **Sasha**
