Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\).
- `k` is an integer.
- `pb` is an integer.
- `ps` is an integer.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`.
- `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

This statement will print the string `'Bodya'` directly without any reference to the other variables or their values.

Output: **Bodya**
