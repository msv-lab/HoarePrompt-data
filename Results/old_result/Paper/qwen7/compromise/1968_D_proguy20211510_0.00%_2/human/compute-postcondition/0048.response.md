Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\), and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` if the condition `a[pb - 1] == maxa` is false. If the condition `a[pb - 1] == maxa` is true, `foundb` is set to True.
