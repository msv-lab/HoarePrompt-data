Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True, `s` is a list with three elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with four elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\) if `foundb` is True, or \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1] or a[pb - 1] if pb is used instead of ps]\) if `foundb` is False, and either `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `founds = True` sets the variable `founds` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
