Output State: `i` is equal to `len(s)`, `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb + b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `sb` is equal to the sum of all elements in list `b`, `pres` is a list containing the sum of `ss + s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, and `ss` is equal to the sum of all elements in list `s`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of list `s`. The list `preb` will contain the cumulative sums of list `b` up to each index, the variable `sb` will hold the total sum of all elements in list `b`, the list `pres` will contain the cumulative sums of list `s` up to each index, and the variable `ss` will hold the total sum of all elements in list `s`.
