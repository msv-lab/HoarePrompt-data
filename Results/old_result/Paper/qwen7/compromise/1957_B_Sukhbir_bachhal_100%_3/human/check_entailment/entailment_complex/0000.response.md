### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns the position of the highest set bit in `n` minus one. This is achieved by repeatedly right-shifting `n` until it becomes zero, counting the number of shifts.
   - For any integer `n` within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), the function correctly calculates the position of the highest set bit minus one. The function returns -1 if `n` is 0, which is handled correctly.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program iterates over each test case.
   - If `n > 1`, it uses the `func_1` function to find the highest set bit position in `k` and constructs the array `arr` accordingly.
     - It appends `(2 ** counter - 1)` to `arr` to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.
     - It then appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to ensure the sum is `k`.
     - It fills the rest of the array with zeros to meet the length requirement of `n`.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where `n == 1` by directly printing `k`.
   - The logic ensures that the sum of elements in `arr` equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the elements.

4. **Binary Representation Consideration:**
   - The strategy of using `(2 ** counter - 1)` and `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` ensures that the bitwise OR operation results in a number with the maximum possible number of 1s within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of integers that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
