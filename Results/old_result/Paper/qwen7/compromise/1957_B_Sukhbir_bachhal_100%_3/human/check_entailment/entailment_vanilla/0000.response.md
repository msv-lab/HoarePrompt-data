Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program constructs an array `arr` with specific values.
   - It uses a helper function `func_1` to determine the highest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to `arr` because this value has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation among numbers less than `2 ** counter`.
   - It then appends `k - arr[-1]` to `arr` to ensure the sum of the array equals `k`.
   - The remaining elements of `arr` are set to 0.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Helper Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the position of the highest bit set in `n`.
   - It shifts `n` right until it becomes 0 and counts the number of shifts.

### Verification:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Single Element (`n == 1`)**:
     - If `n == 1`, the program correctly prints `k` since there's only one element and it must sum to `k`.
   - **Multiple Elements (`n > 1`)**:
     - The approach of using `2 ** counter - 1` ensures that the bitwise OR of the elements will have many 1s.
     - The value `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` ensures the sum constraint is met.
     - The rest of the elements are set to 0, which doesn't affect the sum but keeps the number of elements correct.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is a power of 2, the solution works as expected because `2 ** counter - 1` will be the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to that bit position.
   - If `k` is not a power of 2, the solution still works because the bitwise OR of `2 ** counter - 1` and `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` will maximize the number of 1s.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all given constraints and examples. It constructs sequences that satisfy both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
