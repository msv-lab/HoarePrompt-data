Output State: **`position` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is now one-fourth of its original value.**

Explanation: The code `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `n`, which effectively divides `n` by 2. Since `n` was originally a non-zero even number that is half of its original value, after the operation, `n` becomes one-fourth of its original value. The values of `position` and `t` remain unchanged.
