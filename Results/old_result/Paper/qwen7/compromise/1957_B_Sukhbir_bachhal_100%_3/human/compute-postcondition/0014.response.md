Output State: `position` is 32, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is now 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit and increment `position` until `n` becomes 0. Since each iteration halves the value of `n`, and it takes 32 iterations to reduce any non-zero integer within the given constraints to 0 through right-shifting, `position` will be 32 when the loop terminates. At this point, `n` will be 0 because it has been fully right-shifted. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
