Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than 0; `adv` is at least 3; `j` is 2; `ans` is a list with four elements which are `a[i-1] - 3`, `a[i-1] - 3`, `a[i-1] - 2`, and `a[i]`; `counter[a[i-1]]` is decreased by `adv`; `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `counter[a[i]] -= 1` decreases the value of `counter[a[i]]` by 1. Since `counter[a[i]]` was initially decreased by 1, now it is decreased by a total of 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
