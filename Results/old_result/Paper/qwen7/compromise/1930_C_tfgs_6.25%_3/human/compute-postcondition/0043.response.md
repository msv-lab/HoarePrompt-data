Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `ans` is a list with elements `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, `a[n-1] - 3`, `cnt` is `cnt - 3`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `counter[a[i - 1]]` by `adv`. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated state of `counter[a[i - 1]]` is mentioned explicitly.
