Output State: **`i` is `n-1` and the current value of `i` is greater than 0; `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`.**

This means that the variable `adv` is assigned the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `counter` are unchanged from their initial state.
