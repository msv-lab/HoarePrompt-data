Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 1
   - `a[0]` is 1
   - `a[1]` is 2

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is increased by 1 at each iteration (assuming the loop body does not change `i`), `i` will be 2 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `a[0]` is 1, `a[1]` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
