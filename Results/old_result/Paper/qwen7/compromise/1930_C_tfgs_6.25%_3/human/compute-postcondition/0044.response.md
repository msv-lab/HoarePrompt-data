Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `ans` is a list with elements `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, `a[n-1] - 3`, `cnt` is `cnt - 3`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement. Since the else part is not present, the if condition directly determines the final state of the variables as specified in the if part.
