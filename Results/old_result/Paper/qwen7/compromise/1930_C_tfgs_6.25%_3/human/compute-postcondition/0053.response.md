Output State: **`adv` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is a list with two elements which are `a[i-1] - j - 1` and `a[i-1] - j - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element which is `a[i-1] - j - 1`. After appending the same value again, `ans` now contains two elements, both of which are `a[i-1] - j - 1`. The values of `adv` and `j` remain unchanged.
