Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in its conditions for determining whether the digits form a peak. Specifically, the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` does not correctly identify all cases where the digits form a peak. The correct condition should check if `a < b > c` instead of just checking if `b` is the maximum value. Additionally, the condition for `a == b == c` should be handled separately before checking for stairs or peaks, but it's not necessary since the program already handles it with `NONE`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions for a stair and a peak are checked correctly.
