Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program hardcodes some values and does not generalize well for larger \(n\). For example, for \(n=3\), the program outputs:

```
1 1
1 2
2 3
```

This only gives three unique Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), which is not the maximum possible for \(n=3\). The optimal solution should give four unique distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

For \(n=4\), the program outputs:

```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
```

This only gives four unique Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), but the optimal solution should include a point like \((1, 3)\) to achieve five unique distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem requirements.
