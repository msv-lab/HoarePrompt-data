You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, and `j` will be equal to `n`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` (which represents the number of times the outer loop runs) will be decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `n` will be set to at least 10 based on the condition within the loop. The variable `i` will hold the value of `t-1` as it gets updated after each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `j` will be equal to `n` because it is set inside the inner loop which runs from 4 to `n`, and since `n` is at least 10, `j` will also be 10 or greater.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. It then prints a sequence of pairs of integers. Specifically, it always prints '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'; otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of integers from 4 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **First Two Points**: For each test case, the function prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which are always part of the solution.
3. **Special Case for n=3**: When `n` is 3, the function correctly adds the point `(2, 3)`. This is a valid configuration that maximizes the Manhattan distances.
4. **General Case for n > 3**: For `n > 3`, the function prints additional points. Specifically, it prints `(2, 4)` followed by points `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n`. However, this approach does not always maximize the Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.

To verify correctness, let's consider some specific test cases:

- **n = 3**: The given solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`. The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`: \( |1-2| + |1-3| = 3 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)`: \( |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 \)
  Thus, the set of distances is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 3. This is indeed the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

- **n = 4**: The given solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(4, 4)`. The Manhattan distances include:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
  - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \)
  The set of distances is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 6. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\).

- **n = 5**: The given solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(5, 5)`. The Manhattan distances include:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(5, 5)`: \( |1-5| + |1-5| = 8 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(5, 5)`: \( |1-5| + |2-5| = 7 \)
  - Between `(2, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: \( |2-5| + |4-5| = 4 \)
  The set of distances is \(\{1, 3, 4, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 5. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 5\).

Given the above analysis, the function does not always produce the maximum possible set of Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
