Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs the following cells:

```
1 1
1 2
2 3
```

However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should include three cells such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized. A correct arrangement would be:

```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

This arrangement results in the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3. The program's output does not achieve this maximum size for \(n = 3\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
