You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')
        
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, and `j` will be equal to `n`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` (which represents the number of times the outer loop runs) will be decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `n` will be set to at least 10 based on the condition within the loop. The variable `i` will hold the value of `t-1` as it gets updated after each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `j` will be equal to `n` because it is set inside the inner loop which runs from 4 to `n`, and since `n` is at least 10, `j` will also be 10 or greater.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers: t and n, where t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. The function does not return any specific value but seems to perform some operations based on these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
