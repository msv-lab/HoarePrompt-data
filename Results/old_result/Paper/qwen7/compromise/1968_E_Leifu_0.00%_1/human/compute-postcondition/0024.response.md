Output: **2 3**

Explanation: The print statement `print('2 3')` directly outputs the string `'2 3'`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, or `j` affect this output because they are not used within the print statement. The values of these variables (with the exception of `j` being equal to `n`) do not influence the printed result.
