Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 6.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

Here, `j` is explicitly given as 6. Therefore, the expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` will concatenate the string representation of `j` with a space in between and then again with the string representation of `j`.

So, the output will be "6 6".

Output: **6 6**
