State: **`n` must be greater than 3**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with `j` in the range from 4 to `n + 1`.
2. For the loop to execute, the range `4` to `n + 1` must be valid, meaning `n` must be at least 4 (since the smallest value `j` can take is 4).
3. Any initial state of other variables or objects outside the loop head (like `j`) does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `n` must be greater than 3.
