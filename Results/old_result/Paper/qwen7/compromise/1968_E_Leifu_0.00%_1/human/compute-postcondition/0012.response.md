Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `4` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop starts with `j = 4`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` remains 0 as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be `5` at the start of the next iteration.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 5**.
