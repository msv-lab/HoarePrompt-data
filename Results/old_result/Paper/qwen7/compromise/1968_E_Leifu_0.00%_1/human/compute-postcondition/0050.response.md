Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `j` is 11.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` must be at least 10 (since the loop starts from 4 and increments `j` by 1 each time, it will continue until `j` reaches `n+1`), and the value of `j` will be 11 because the loop will stop just after printing `j = n`.
