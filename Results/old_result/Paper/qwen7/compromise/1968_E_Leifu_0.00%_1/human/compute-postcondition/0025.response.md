The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `n`.

The `print('2 4')` statement simply prints the string `'2 4'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are not used in this particular print statement.

Output: **2 4**
