Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `j` and the range defined by `4` to `n + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `4` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `j` is 6.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, if `j` is currently 6, it will be incremented to 7 in the next iteration.

5. **Check if the loop condition is still satisfied**: For the loop to continue, `j` must still be within the range `4` to `n + 1`. Given that `j` will be 7, this means `n + 1` must be greater than or equal to 7, which implies `n` must be at least 6.

6. **Adjust the state**: Based on the above analysis, we need to update the state to reflect that `j` will be 7 and `n` must be at least 6.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 7**
