Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros; `nums[0]` is equal to (1 << (`k`'s bit length) - 1) - 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `nums[0]` to the value of `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Here, `k.bit_length()` gives the number of bits necessary to represent `k` in binary. For example, if `k` is 5, its binary representation is `101`, which requires 3 bits, so `k.bit_length()` would be 3. Thus, `1 << 3 - 1` equals `1 << 2`, which is 4, and `4 - 1` equals 3. Therefore, `nums[0]` is set to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
