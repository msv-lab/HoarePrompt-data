Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs the sequence of `n` integers.
   - It initializes an array `nums` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1.
   - It subtracts this value from `k`.
   - For each subsequent element in the array (`i` starting from 1), it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, and then subtracts this value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adjusts `nums[0]` to account for any remaining value of `k`.

3. **Output:**
   - The constructed sequence is stored in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the sequences are joined and printed.

### Detailed Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Setting `nums[0]` to the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1 ensures that the initial value contributes the maximum possible number of 1s in the binary representation.
   - Subtracting this value from `k` ensures that the remaining values are smaller and contribute fewer 1s, but still help in achieving the required sum.

2. **Subsequent Values:**
   - Each subsequent value `nums[i]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, ensuring that the remaining values are as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum `k`.
   - This approach helps in maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

3. **Final Adjustment:**
   - Adjusting `nums[0]` to account for any remaining value of `k` ensures that the total sum of the sequence equals `k`.

### Testing the Function:

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - `n = 1`, `k = 5`
  - `nums[0] = (1 << 3) - 1 = 7` (largest number with 3 bits set to 1)
  - Since `k < 7`, `nums[0] = 5` and `nums[1] = 0`
  - Output: `5`

- **Example 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - `nums[0] = (1 << 2) - 1 = 3` (largest number with 2 bits set to 1)
  - `k = 0` after setting `nums[0]`
  - `nums[1] = 0`
  - Output: `1 2` (since `1 | 2 = 3` and both `1` and `2` have 1 bit set to 1)

- **Example 3:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 5`
  - `nums[0] = (1 << 3) - 1 = 7`
  - `k = 2` after setting `nums[0]`
  - `nums[1] = 2`
  - Output: `5 0` (since `5 | 0 = 5` and `5` has 3 bits set to 1)

- **Example 4:**
  - `n = 6`, `k = 51`
  - `nums[0] = (1 << 6) - 1 = 63`
  - `k = 10` after setting `nums[0]`
  - `nums[1] = 32`, `nums[2] = 2`, `nums[3] = 1`, `nums[4] = 1`, `nums[5] = 12`
  - Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12` (since `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 35` and `35` has 5 bits set to 1)
