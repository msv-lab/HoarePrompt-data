Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the number of 1's in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The bitwise OR operation tends to maximize the number of 1's when the numbers in the sequence have overlapping bits set to 1.
   - A good strategy is to set the highest possible number of bits to 1 in the first element of the sequence, and then distribute the remaining sum among the rest of the elements.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - It sets `nums[0]` to the largest possible number with the same number of bits as `k` (i.e., \( (1 << k.bit_length()) - 1 \)).
   - It then iteratively sets the next elements in the list to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, reducing `k` accordingly.
   - Finally, it adds the remaining value of `k` to `nums[0]`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The approach ensures that the first element is maximally set to a number with the most significant bits set to 1.
   - The subsequent elements are set to either `nums[0] + 1` or `k`, ensuring that the sum remains correct and the bitwise OR operation benefits from the high bit values.
   - The final adjustment of adding the remaining `k` to `nums[0]` ensures the sum constraint is met.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to the maximum possible value for `nums[0]`, the function correctly handles this by setting `nums[0]` to `k` and distributing the rest as needed.
   - The function correctly handles the sum constraint and the bitwise OR operation.

Based on the analysis, the provided function correctly implements the logic to satisfy both the sum constraint and the bitwise OR condition.

Correctness: **True**
