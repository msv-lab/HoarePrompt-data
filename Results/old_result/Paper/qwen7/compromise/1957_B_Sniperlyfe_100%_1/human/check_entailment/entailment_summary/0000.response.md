Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is designed to generate such a sequence.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to \( 2^{m} - 1 \), where \( m \) is the bit length of \( k \). This ensures that `nums[0]` is a large number with many 1s in its binary representation.
   - The remaining elements are set to either `nums[0] + 1` or `k` (whichever is smaller), ensuring the total sum is `k`.
   - Finally, the first element is adjusted to ensure the exact sum `k`.

3. **Binary Representation Consideration**:
   - By setting `nums[0]` to a large number with many 1s, and the rest of the numbers to small values (either `nums[0] + 1` or `k`), the bitwise OR of the entire sequence will have a high number of 1s.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( k \) is very small, the solution still works because the remaining elements will be zero, and the bitwise OR will still maximize the number of 1s.

5. **Sum Check**:
   - The sum of the sequence is correctly managed, ensuring it equals `k`.

Based on the above analysis, the provided function `func_1` correctly constructs the required sequence according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
