The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these integers and prints the result. The final output for each test case is derived from a series of calculations involving the values of \( n \) and \( m \), specifically through a loop that iterates based on the value of \( m \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result for each test case.
