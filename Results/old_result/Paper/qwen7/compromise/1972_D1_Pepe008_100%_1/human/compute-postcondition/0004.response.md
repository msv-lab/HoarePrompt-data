Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer equal to `int(info[0])`; `b` is an integer equal to `int(info[1])`; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace; `suma` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `suma` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables `T`, `a`, `b`, and `info`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `suma` is updated to 0.
