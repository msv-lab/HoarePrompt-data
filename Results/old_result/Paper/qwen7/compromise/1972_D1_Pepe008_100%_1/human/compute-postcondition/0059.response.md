Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `b + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` is 2.
   - `suma` is 4.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `b + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `b + 1` must be greater than 3, which means `b` must be greater than or equal to 3. However, since `b` must be greater than 3 (from the postcondition), `b` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 3 to 4.
   - `b` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.
   - `x` and `suma` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`b` must be greater than 3 and at least 4, `i` is 4, `x` is 2, `suma` is 4**.
