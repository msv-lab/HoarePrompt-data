Output State: `b` must be greater than 9, `i` is 7, `x` is calculated based on the current value of `i`, `suma` is increased by the sum of `x` values for each iteration, and the final `suma` is 43.

To explain this output state in more detail:
- The loop continues until `i` exceeds `b`.
- After the first 3 iterations, `i` was 6, so after all iterations, `i` will be 7.
- The value of `b` must be greater than 9 because the loop increments `i` starting from 5, and it needs to run through at least 7 iterations.
- The value of `x` changes with each iteration of `i`. For `i=7`, `x` would be calculated as `(a - 7 * 6) // 49 + 1`.
- The `suma` variable accumulates the value of `x` for each valid iteration where the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` holds true. Based on the given information, the total increase in `suma` after all iterations is 43.
