Output State: **`b` must be greater than 3 and at least 4, `i` is 4, `x` is 3, `suma` is 4**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. However, the value of `a` is not provided, and it is not clear from the initial state what `a` is. Since `i` is 4, the expression simplifies to `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`. Without knowing the exact value of `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. But since `x` is updated based on the given formula, and the other variables (`b`, `i`, and `suma`) remain unchanged, the final state is as stated above.
