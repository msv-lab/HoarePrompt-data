Output State: **`b` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `x` is 4, `suma` is 0, `t` is `t_prev + 1`, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `info` is a list of strings from the input split by spaces.**

The code sets `suma` to 0, which updates its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
