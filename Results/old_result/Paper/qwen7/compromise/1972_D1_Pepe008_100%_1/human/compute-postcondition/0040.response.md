Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a value calculated as (a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1, which simplifies to `x` is a value calculated as (a - 0) // 1 + 1, further simplifying to `x` is `a` + 1.**

In natural language: `b` must still be greater than 0, `i` remains 1, and `x` is calculated as `a` + 1.
