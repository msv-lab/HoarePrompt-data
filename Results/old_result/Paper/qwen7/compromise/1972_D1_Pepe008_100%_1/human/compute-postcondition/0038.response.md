Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `suma` is 0, `x` is the last computed value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), `t` is `T`**.

Explanation: The line `suma = 0` initializes the variable `suma` to 0. This sets the value of `suma` to 0, but does not affect the values of the other variables (`b`, `a`, `x`, `t`, and `info`). Therefore, the updated state includes `suma` being set to 0 while keeping the other variables unchanged.
