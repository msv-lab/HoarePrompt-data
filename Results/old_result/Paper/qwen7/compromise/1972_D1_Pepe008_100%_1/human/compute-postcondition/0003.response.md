Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer equal to `int(info[0])`; `b` is an integer equal to `int(info[1])`; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first and second elements of the list `info` (converted to integers) to variables `a` and `b` respectively. The value of `T` remains unchanged, and `info` retains its original state as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace.
