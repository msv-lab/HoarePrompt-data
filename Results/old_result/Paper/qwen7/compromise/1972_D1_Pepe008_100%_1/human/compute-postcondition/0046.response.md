Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is 0, `suma` is 1, and the condition `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0)` is true.**

Explanation: The variable `suma` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables (`b`, `i`, `x`, and the condition involving `a`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
