Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to the variable `x`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `i`, `x` is expressed in terms of these variables. The precondition that `b` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
