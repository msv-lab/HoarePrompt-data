Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` retains its initial value, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `suma` contains the sum of all valid `x` values plus additional 1s based on the specified conditions within the loop, `x` is the last computed value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), `t` is `T`**.

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `info`. The other variables (`b`, `a`, `suma`, `x`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
