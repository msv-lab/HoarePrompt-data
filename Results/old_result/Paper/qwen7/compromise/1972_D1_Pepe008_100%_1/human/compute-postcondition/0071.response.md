Output State: **`b` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `x` is 4, `suma` is 15, `t` is `t_prev + 1`, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `info` is a list of strings from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first two elements of the `info` list to variables `a` and `b` respectively, converting them to integers using `int()`. The values of other variables (`b`, `i`, `x`, `suma`, `t`, and `info`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
