Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Recap:
Given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
2. \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Given Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases \( T \) and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \) and then performs a calculation involving a loop from 1 to \( b \) (inclusive).

Here's the problematic part of the code:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
        suma += x
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
            suma += 1
```

This loop seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on some conditions, but it doesn't directly address the problem requirements. Specifically:
- The condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is not directly checked.
- The logic inside the loop does not seem to correctly implement the required conditions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here's a more appropriate approach:

1. Iterate over all possible values of \( a \) from 1 to \( n \).
2. For each \( a \), iterate over all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to \( m \).
3. Check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It uses a different and incorrect approach to count the valid pairs.

Correctness: **False**
