### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Recap
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating some values based on \(a\) and \(b\). However, it does not correctly implement the required logic.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `suma` is initialized to 0, which is intended to count the number of valid pairs.

3. **Loop Through Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The program iterates through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(b\).

4. **Calculating `x`:**
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is used, but it does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

5. **Additional Condition Check:**
   - The conditions `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are irrelevant to the problem constraints.

6. **GCD Requirement:**
   - The program does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

7. **Output Adjustment:**
   - The final output adjustment `suma - 2` is unnecessary and does not align with the problem requirements.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

### Corrected Program Explanation
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initializes `suma` to 0 to count the number of valid pairs.

3. **Nested Loops:**
   - Iterates over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).

4. **Check Condition:**
   - Checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) using the `math.gcd` function.

5. **Count Valid Pairs:**
   - Increments `suma` if the condition is satisfied.

6. **Output:**
   - Prints the total count of valid pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly implement the solution due to incorrect logic and irrelevant conditions. The corrected program correctly implements the required logic and should produce the correct results.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
