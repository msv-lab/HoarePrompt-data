Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `suma` is initialized to 0. This will be used to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Loop Through Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The program iterates through all possible values of `b` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).

4. **Calculating `x`:**
   - For each value of `b`, it calculates `x` using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.

5. **Additional Condition Check:**
   - It checks if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0` are true.
   - If both conditions are met, it adds 1 to `suma`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Formula for `x`:**
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` seems to be an attempt to count something, but it does not directly relate to the problem statement.

2. **Conditions Check:**
   - The conditions `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` do not seem to be relevant to the problem constraints.

3. **GCD Requirement:**
   - The problem requires `a + b` to be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The given code does not check this condition at all.

4. **Output Adjustment:**
   - The final output adjustment `suma - 2` is unnecessary and does not align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. It uses a formula and conditions that do not match the required constraints and does not properly account for the gcd requirement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
