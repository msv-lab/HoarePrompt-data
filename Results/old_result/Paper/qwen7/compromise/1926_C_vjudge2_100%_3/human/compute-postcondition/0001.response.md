The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. For the loop to execute the first time, `num` must be non-zero.

Right before the loop, `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 2 \times 10^5\). Since the loop condition is `num != 0`, and given that `num` is already a positive integer within the specified range, it is guaranteed to be non-zero.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`a` is 0, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5**
