Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph with the minimum weight of the lightest edge in the cycle.
2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list, and the edges are stored in a list.
3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: The `DSU` class is used to manage the union-find operations efficiently, ensuring that cycles are detected and the minimum edge weight in each cycle is tracked.
4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and identify cycles, specifically focusing on the cycle with the minimum edge weight.
5. **Main Functionality**: The `func_6` function processes the graph and finds the required cycle, while `func_7` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case.
6. **Edge Cases**: The code correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the graph is processed accurately. The use of `DSU` and `dfs` ensures that the cycle with the minimum edge weight is identified and returned.

Given the detailed analysis of each function and the overall structure of the program, the program appears to be designed to solve the problem correctly. All necessary steps are included, and the logic seems sound.

Correctness: **True**
