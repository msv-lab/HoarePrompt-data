The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( m \), where \( 3 \leq n \leq m \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \right\rfloor \) and \( m \leq 2 \times 10^5 \). For each test case, it reads \( m \) lines, each containing three integers \( u \), \( v \), and \( w \), representing an edge between vertices \( u \) and \( v \) with weight \( w \), where \( 1 \leq u, v \leq n \), \( u \neq v \), and \( 1 \leq w \leq 10^6 \). The function does not return any specific value but processes the input data according to the specified structure.
