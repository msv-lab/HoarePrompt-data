Based on the initial state provided:

- `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that form a cycle.
- `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes involved in the cycle with the minimum weight edge.
- `colors` is a list of length `n+1` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `res` is the result of the `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` function call.

The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, where `res` is the result of the depth-first search (DFS) starting from `node_u` and exploring the graph.

Given that the DFS function `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` is called, it will traverse the graph starting from `node_u` and include all nodes that are part of the cycle involving `node_u` and `node_v`.

Since `colors` is initialized to 0 for all nodes, and assuming the DFS correctly identifies the nodes in the cycle, `res` will contain the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal of the cycle.

Output: **node_u node_v (or any sequence of nodes forming the cycle, including node_u and node_v)**
