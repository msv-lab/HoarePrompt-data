Output State: **_min_edge is the minimum weight of the edges that form a cycle, node_u and node_v are the nodes involved in the cycle with the minimum weight edge, colors is a list of length n+1 with all elements initialized to 0, res is the result of dfs(node_u, -1, []).**

Explanation: The code calls the `dfs` function with `node_u` as the starting node, `-1` as the parent node (indicating no parent), and an empty list as the path. The `dfs` function returns a value which is stored in the variable `res`. The values of `_min_edge`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `colors` remain unchanged from their initial state.
