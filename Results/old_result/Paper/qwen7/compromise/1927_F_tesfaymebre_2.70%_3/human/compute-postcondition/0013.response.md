Output State: **_min_edge is the minimum weight of the edges that form a cycle, node_u and node_v are the nodes involved in the cycle with the minimum weight edge, colors is a list of length n+1 with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `colors` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged from their initial state.
