Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`. The only variable involved here is `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is a positive integer. Given the initial state, `test_cases` is assigned a value between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive) by the function `func_1()`.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop requires `test_cases` to be a positive integer, and we know from the problem statement that `test_cases` is guaranteed to be within the specified range, no further adjustment is needed beyond ensuring that `test_cases` is indeed a positive integer.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts remains as follows:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4**

This state already ensures that the loop will execute because `test_cases` is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range.
