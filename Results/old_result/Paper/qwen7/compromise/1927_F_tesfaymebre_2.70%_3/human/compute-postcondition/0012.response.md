Functionality: **The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search traversal on a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex in the DFS traversal), and `path` (a list representing the current path being explored). The function returns the list `path` if the current vertex `curr` has been visited (color 1) and is part of the path, otherwise it returns an empty list.**
