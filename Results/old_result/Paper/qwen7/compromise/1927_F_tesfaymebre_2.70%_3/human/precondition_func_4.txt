t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5), the second line contains m lines with three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and it is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and the graph does not contain loops.
