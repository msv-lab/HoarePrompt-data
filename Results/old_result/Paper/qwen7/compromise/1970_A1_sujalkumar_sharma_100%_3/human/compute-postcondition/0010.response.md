Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" characters. It calculates the balance of parentheses at each position in the string, stores this information along with the index and character at each position in a list of tuples, sorts this list based on balance and index, and finally constructs and returns a new string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.**
