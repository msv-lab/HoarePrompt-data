#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the current balance, the index `i`, and the character at index `i` of the string `s`; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` which is created by joining the third element of each tuple in `prefix_balance`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" characters. It calculates the balance of parentheses at each position in the string, stores this information along with the index and character at each position in a list of tuples, sorts this list based on balance and index, and finally constructs and returns a new string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.
