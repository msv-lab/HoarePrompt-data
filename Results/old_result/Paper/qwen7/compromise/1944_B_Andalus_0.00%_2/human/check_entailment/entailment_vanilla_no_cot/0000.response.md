Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `ldb` and `rdb`:**
   - The code attempts to identify duplicate elements in `lft` and `rgt` using `ldb` and `rdb`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the number of duplicates might be less than `2k`, which is necessary to form the required subsets `l` and `r`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Subsets:**
   - The logic for constructing the subsets `l` and `r` from `ldb` and `sng` is flawed. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the XOR values of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. Instead, it simply prints elements from `ldb` and `sng` without ensuring the XOR condition is met.

3. **Handling of Single Elements (`sng`):**
   - The code assumes that `sng` will contain enough unique elements to form the required subsets. However, this is not always the case, and the code does not handle scenarios where `sng` is insufficient to form the required subsets.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is not strictly adhered to. The code should output exactly `2k` elements for both `l` and `r`, but the current implementation may output fewer elements if `ldb` and `sng` do not provide enough elements.

To fix these issues, a more robust approach is needed to ensure that the XOR values of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. One possible approach is to use a hash-based method to track the XOR values and then construct the subsets accordingly.
