Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 1, making it equal to `k` + 1. The conditions that `rdb` must not be empty and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged.
