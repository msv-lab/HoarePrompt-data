Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `sng` has appended the value of `lft[2]`.**

In this case, the code `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[2]` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is 2, `sng` now includes the element at index 2 from the list `lft`. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 2 remain unchanged.
