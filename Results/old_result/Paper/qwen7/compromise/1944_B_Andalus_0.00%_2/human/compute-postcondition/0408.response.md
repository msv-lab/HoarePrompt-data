Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the object `rdb`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `rdb` is the iterable over which the loop will iterate.
   - `elem` will take on the value of each element in `rdb` during each iteration.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `rdb`.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know what happens inside the loop, but we need to ensure that the loop can start.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element. If `rdb` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- All elements in `ldb` have been processed.
- `sz` is equal to the initial value of `sz` plus the total number of elements processed in `sng`.
- No further elements are printed.

We need to ensure that `rdb` is not empty for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `rdb` contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`rdb` must contain at least one element.**
