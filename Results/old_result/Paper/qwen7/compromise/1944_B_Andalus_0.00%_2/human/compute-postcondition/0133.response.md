Output State: **The loop continues until `sz` reaches `k`, or there are no more elements in `rdb`.**

In this final output state, the loop will continue to print pairs of elements from `rdb` as long as `sz` (which starts at 0 and increases by 2 with each iteration) is less than `k` and there are still elements left in `rdb`. The printing stops either when `sz` reaches `k` (causing the loop to break), or when `rdb` is exhausted (i.e., no more elements to iterate over). The variable `sz` will reflect the total count of elements printed in pairs, and `rdb` will be an empty iterable if all its elements have been processed.
