Output State: **`ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[i]`, `n` must be greater than 1, the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the value of `lft[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. The value of `lft[i]` is equal to the value of `lft[i - 1]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
