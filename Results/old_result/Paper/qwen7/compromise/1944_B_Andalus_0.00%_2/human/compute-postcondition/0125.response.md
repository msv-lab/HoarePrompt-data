Output State: **`sz` remains 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than it had before the current iteration started, and we break out of the most internal loop or iteration.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or iteration. Since the initial state describes that `sz` remains 2 and `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than it had before the current iteration started, these conditions remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it breaks out of the current loop or iteration.
