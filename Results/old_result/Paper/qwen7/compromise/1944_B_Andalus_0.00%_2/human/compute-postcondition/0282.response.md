Output State: **`sz` is either 4 or 6, `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, `elem` is the next element of `rdb`, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. Since `sz` was either 2 or 4, adding 2 to these values results in `sz` being either 4 or 6. The values of `rdb` and `elem` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet. The condition regarding `sz` and `k` also remains the same.
