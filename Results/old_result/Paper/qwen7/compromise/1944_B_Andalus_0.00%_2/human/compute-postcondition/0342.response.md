Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `ldb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`. `sng` will contain all unique elements from `lft` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, provided they are not followed by the same element or are the last element in `lft`. `rdb` remains as `['']`, `lft` contains the original elements from the input, `rgt` remains empty, and `ldb` and `sng` are populated based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `ldb` will store all elements in `lft` that are identical to their immediate predecessor, and `sng` will store all elements in `lft` that are different from their immediate predecessor unless they are the last element in the list. The other variables (`rdb`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng`) will maintain their respective states as described.
