Output State: **`i` is now 2; `rdb` has the element `rgt[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `rdb` will have its value updated by appending `rgt[2]`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 is still valid but not affected by this line of code.
