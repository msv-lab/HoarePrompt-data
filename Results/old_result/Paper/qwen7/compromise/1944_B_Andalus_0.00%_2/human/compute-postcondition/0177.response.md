Output State: **`ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sng` is a list containing either `lft[i]` (if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`), or `lft[i]` is added to `sng` (if `lft[i]` does not equal `lft[i - 1]`).**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the list `sng` remains unchanged according to the given conditions.
