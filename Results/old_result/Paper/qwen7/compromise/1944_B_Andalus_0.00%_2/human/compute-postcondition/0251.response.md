Output State: **`sz` is 4, `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the third element of `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `sz`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we have exited the most internal loop or conditional block.
