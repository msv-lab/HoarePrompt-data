Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng:`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the sequence `sng`. After all iterations, the variable `sz` will be an integer value that is at least `k` and no larger than `n-1`.

3. **Determine the initial state adjustments needed**: Since the loop modifies the state through its body (which is omitted), we need to ensure that the loop can execute and produce the desired final state for `sz`.

4. **Analyze the conditions for `sz`**: For `sz` to be an integer value that is at least `k` and no larger than `n-1`, the sequence `sng` must contain elements that can be assigned to `sz` during the loop iterations.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `sng` contains elements that can satisfy the condition for `sz`. Additionally, we need to set up the initial state such that the loop can start and proceed correctly.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `sng` and `sz`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz <= n-1`, `sz` is initially set to a value within the range `[k, n-1]`**. 

However, since we cannot specify the exact initial value of `sz` without more information, we focus on ensuring `sng` contains valid elements for `sz`.

State: **`sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz <= n-1`**.
