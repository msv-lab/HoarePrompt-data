Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 2.
- `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
- `elem` is the first element of `sng`.

The print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`.

Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable, it must contain at least one element. Therefore, `elem` is the first element of this iterable.

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element of the non-empty iterable sng)**
