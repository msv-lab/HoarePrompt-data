Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the slice of `lst` starting from index `n` to `rgt`. This means `rgt` now contains all elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. The other variables (`rdb`, `sz`, `k`, `n`, `lst`, and `lft`) remain unchanged according to their initial states.
