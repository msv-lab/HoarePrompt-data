Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, and if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the current value of `lft[i]` is added to the list `ldb`. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then the element `lft[i]` is appended to the list `sng`; otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.
