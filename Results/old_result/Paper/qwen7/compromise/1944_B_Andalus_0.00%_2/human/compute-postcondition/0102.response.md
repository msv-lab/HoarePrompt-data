Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz <= n-1`, and `sz` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until the condition `sz >= k` is met or the end of the sequence is reached. The loop terminates when `sz` reaches a value that satisfies `sz >= k` or when there are no more elements in `sng`.
