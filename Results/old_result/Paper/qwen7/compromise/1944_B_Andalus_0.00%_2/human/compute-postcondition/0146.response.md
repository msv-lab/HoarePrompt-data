Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + 2, `sng` must not be empty, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Since `sz` was initially equal to `k` + 1, after executing this line, `sz` becomes `k` + 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
