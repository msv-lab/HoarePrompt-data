Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 0.
- `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, meaning it has been completely traversed, and the last element of `sng` is stored in `elem`.
- `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, but this variable is not used in the print statement.
- The value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, but `k` is not explicitly defined, so we don't need to use this information for the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

This will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since `elem` is the last element of the iterable `sng`, and `sng` has been fully iterated, `elem` contains the last element of `sng`.

Output: **elem elem**
