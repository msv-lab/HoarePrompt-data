Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lft = lst[:n]
    rgt = lst[n:]
    ldb = []
    rdb = []
    sng = []
    lft.sort()
    rgt.sort()
    for i in range(1, n):
        if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
            ldb.append(lft[i])
        elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
            sng.append(lft[i])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
            rdb.append(rgt[i])
    sz = 0
    for elem in ldb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()
    sz = 0
    for elem in rdb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + n, where `n` is the total number of elements in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sz` will be equal to `k` plus the total number of elements in `sng`. The loop will continue to print each element from `sng` until either `sz` reaches `k` (which would cause an immediate break) or there are no more elements in `sng`. Since the loop continues until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted, and given that the loop prints all elements of `sng`, `sz` will eventually equal `k` plus the length of `sng`, assuming `sng` is fully iterated over before `sz` reaches `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng`, and `rdb` is an empty iterable because there are no elements left to process after the loop has completed.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `sz` will be equal to the length of `sng` because the loop increments `sz` by 1 in each iteration until `sz` is no longer less than `k` or `k - sz` is less than 2. The loop stops once `sz` reaches the length of `sng`. At this point, `elem` will be the last element of `sng` because the loop processes each element sequentially. Since the loop breaks when `sz` is no longer less than `k` or `k - sz` is less than 2, `rdb` will be an empty iterable as all elements have been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: All elements in `sng` have been processed, `sz` is equal to the total number of elements in `sng`, and `rdb` remains empty.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `sz` is less than `k`. Since `sz` increments by 1 with each iteration and the loop breaks when `sz` is no longer less than `k`, the loop will continue until all elements in `sng` have been processed. Given that the initial state ensures `sz` starts at a value where it can be incremented to match the size of `sng`, and considering the loop breaks when `sz` reaches `k` or more, all elements in `sng` will be printed exactly once, making `sz` equal to the total number of elements in `sng`. The variable `rdb` is not affected by the loop, so it remains empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
