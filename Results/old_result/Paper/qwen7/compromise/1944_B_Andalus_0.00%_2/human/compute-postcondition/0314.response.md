Output State: **`sng` is an empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in an empty iterable (which is `elem` itself), `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1 (which is 1), `rdb` is now `['']`, `ldb` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `sng = []` changes the value of `sng` to an empty iterable. Since `sng` was previously a non-empty iterable with `elem` being its last element, after this assignment, `sng` is now empty. The value of `elem` remains unchanged as it refers to the last element of the previous `sng`, which is still `elem`. The value of `sz` is calculated as the length of the new `sng` (which is 0) plus 1, resulting in `sz` being 1. The values of `rdb` and `ldb` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
