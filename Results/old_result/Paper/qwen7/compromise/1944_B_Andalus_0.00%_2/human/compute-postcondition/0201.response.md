Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` (which is `rgt[2]`) appended to it.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3 if the loop continues.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n`. Given that `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `rdb` will contain `rgt[3]` appended to it, assuming the loop continues.

6. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `rdb` will contain `rgt[3]` appended to it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `rdb` contains the element `rgt[3]` appended to it**
