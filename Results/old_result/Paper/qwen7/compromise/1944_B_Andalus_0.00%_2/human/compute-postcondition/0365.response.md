Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 2.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Here, `elem` is a variable that is being printed twice, with a space as the end character. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since the problem does not specify what `elem` is, we cannot determine its exact value.

Given the information, we can only describe `elem` as an element from `ldb` (since `ldb` contains at least one element).

Output: **elem elem** (where elem is an element from the list `ldb`)
