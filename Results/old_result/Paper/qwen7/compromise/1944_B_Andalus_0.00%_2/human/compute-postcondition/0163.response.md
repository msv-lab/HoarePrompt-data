Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, `sng` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `sng`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, all the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
