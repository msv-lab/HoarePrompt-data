Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, and the condition `lft[i] != lft[i - 1]` holds true. Additionally, the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`; `sng` now contains the element `lft[i]` at the last appended position.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, appending it to `sng` does not affect these conditions. The value of `n`, the index `i`, and the condition `lft[i] != lft[i - 1]` remain unchanged. The only new information is that `sng` now includes the value of `lft[i]`.
