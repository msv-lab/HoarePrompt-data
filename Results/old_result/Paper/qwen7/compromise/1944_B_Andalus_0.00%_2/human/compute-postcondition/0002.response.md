Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 5000, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `T` and `_` remain unchanged from their initial state.
