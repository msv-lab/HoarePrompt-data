Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means that `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - If `rgt[3]` is equal to `rgt[2]`, then `rdb` has appended `rgt[3]`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` would be 4.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4 (because 4 < n).

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 (since it was initially greater than or equal to 3 and now must accommodate `i = 4`).

7. **Consider the Additional Condition**:
   - The condition `if rgt[3] == rgt[2]:` needs to be checked again for the new value of `i`.
   - If `rgt[4]` equals `rgt[3]`, then `rdb` should append `rgt[4]`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and if `rgt[4]` is equal to `rgt[3]`, then `rdb` has appended `rgt[4]`**.
