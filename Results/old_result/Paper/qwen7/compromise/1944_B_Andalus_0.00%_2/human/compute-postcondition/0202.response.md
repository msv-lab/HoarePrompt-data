Output State: **`i` is 3; `rdb` contains the elements `rgt[3]` and the element appended which is `rgt[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `rgt[i]` to `rdb`. Given that `i` is 3, `rgt[i]` is `rgt[3]`. Therefore, `rdb` now contains both the original element `rgt[3]` and the newly appended `rgt[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
