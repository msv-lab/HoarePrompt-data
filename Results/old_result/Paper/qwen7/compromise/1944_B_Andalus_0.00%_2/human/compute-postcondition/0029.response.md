Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, the only variable that changes within the loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` can be either 2 or 3, and `n` must be greater than 1, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since `i` can be either 2 or 3, the next value of `i` will be 3 if `i` was 2, and 4 if `i` was 3 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).

5. **Adjust the state of `n`**: `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue. Since `n` is not modified within the loop, it remains the same.

6. **Adjust the state of `ldb`**: The value of `ldb` is set to `lft[i]` and must not be equal to `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i+1]` under certain conditions. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `ldb` will be `lft[3]` if `i` was 2, and `lft[4]` if `i` was 3.

7. **Adjust the state of `lft`**: The values of `lft` do not change within the loop, so they remain the same.

8. **Adjust the state of `sng`**: The set `sng` contains specific elements based on the value of `i`. If `i` was 2, `sng` contained `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`. If `i` was 3, `sng` contained `lft[3]` and `lft[4]`. With `i` now being 3 or 4, `sng` will contain `lft[3]` and `lft[4]` if `i` was 2, and `lft[4]` and `lft[5]` if `i` was 3.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3 or 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `ldb` is equal to `lft[3]` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[4]`, and `sng` contains the elements `lft[3]` and `lft[4]`**.
