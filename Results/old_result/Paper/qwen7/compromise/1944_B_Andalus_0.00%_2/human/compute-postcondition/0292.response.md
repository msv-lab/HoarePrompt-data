Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` still holds true, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
