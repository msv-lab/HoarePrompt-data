Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` and `sz` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is increased by 2, and since the initial postcondition was that `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`, this postcondition remains valid. Therefore, `sz` is now an integer greater than or equal to `k` and has been increased by 2.
