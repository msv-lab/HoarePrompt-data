State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the iterable `rdb`.
2. For the loop to execute, the iterable `rdb` must contain at least one element.
3. The variable `sz` (which is currently 0) does not affect whether the loop can execute; it is an initial state before the loop starts.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `rdb` must be a non-empty iterable.

Thus, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `rdb` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
