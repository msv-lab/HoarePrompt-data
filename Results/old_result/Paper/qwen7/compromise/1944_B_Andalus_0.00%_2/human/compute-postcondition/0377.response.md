Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ldb` contains at least one element.
   - `sz` is either equal to its original value or its original value plus 2.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is less than 2.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for elem in ldb:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `elem`: This variable is used to iterate over elements in `ldb`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `ldb`.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `ldb`, the only variables that change within the loop head are `elem`.
   - `ldb` itself does not change; it still contains at least one element (since the loop continues).
   - `sz` and `k` are not directly modified by the loop itself but could be modified within the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the loop head states, we cannot assume changes to `sz` and `k` without additional information from the loop body.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is either equal to its original value or its original value plus 2, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is less than 2.**
