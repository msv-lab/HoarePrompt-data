Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + 2, `sng` must not be empty and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `rdb`, `sz`, and `sng`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the variables retain their initial states, and the only effect is that we break out of the implied loop or conditional structure.
