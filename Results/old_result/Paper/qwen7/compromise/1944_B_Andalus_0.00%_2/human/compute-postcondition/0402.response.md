Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is defined as `sz_prev + 1`. This means `sz` is the value of `sz_prev` incremented by 1.
- `sng` must have at least one more element. This implies that `sng` is a list or similar collection with at least `sz` elements.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, this condition does not affect the `print` statement directly since it only influences the loops or conditions.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`. Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `elem` must be an element from the list `sng` because the code is likely iterating over `sng`.

Given these details, the output will be the value of `elem`, which is one of the elements from the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the list sng)**
