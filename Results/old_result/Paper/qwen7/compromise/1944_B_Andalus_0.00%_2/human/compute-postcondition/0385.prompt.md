Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` can be any positive integer, `rdb` contains all the elements of `rgt` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` if they are repeated consecutively from the previous element, `sz` is 0, and the other variables (`ldb`, `sng`, `lft`, `rgt`) remain in their initial states or as described in the initial state condition.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is either equal to its original value plus 2 or remains unchanged, and if the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is either equal to its original value or its original value plus 2, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is less than 2. After the execution of the if-else block, if `sz >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is either equal to its original value or its original value plus 2, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is less than 2. After the execution of the if-else block, if `sz >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
