Output State: **All elements in `sng` have been processed, `sz` is equal to the total number of elements in `sng`, and `rdb` remains empty.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, all elements in `sng` have been processed exactly once. The variable `sz` will be equal to the total number of elements in `sng` because the loop increments `sz` by 1 for each element in `sng` until `sz` reaches the length of `sng`. The loop does not affect the contents of `rdb`, which remains empty as no elements are added to it during the loop's execution.
