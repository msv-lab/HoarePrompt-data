Output State: **`sz` is 2, `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional context. All other variables retain their initial states.
