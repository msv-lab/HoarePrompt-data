Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is incremented by 1 (`sz = sz + 1`).
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `sng` contains at least one element, let's denote the first element of `sng` as `elem`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element of the list sng)**
