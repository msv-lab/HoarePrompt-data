Output State: **`sng` must have at least one element, and the size of `sng` (denoted as sz) is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `sng` or `sz`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions, these remain unchanged.
