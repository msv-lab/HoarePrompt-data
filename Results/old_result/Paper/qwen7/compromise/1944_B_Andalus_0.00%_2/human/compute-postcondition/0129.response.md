Output State: **`sz` is 4, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than it had before the current iteration started, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or iteration.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` was initially 2, and the code increments `sz` by 2, making `sz` equal to 4. The conditions involving `rdb` and the comparison with `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
