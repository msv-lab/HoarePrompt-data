Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The key variables here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng`. Since `elem` is just a temporary variable used within the loop, it does not affect the continuation of the loop. The loop will continue as long as `sng` is not empty.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must contain at least one element. Since `rdb` and `sz` are not directly related to the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `sng` to ensure it contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + 1, `sng` must not be empty**
