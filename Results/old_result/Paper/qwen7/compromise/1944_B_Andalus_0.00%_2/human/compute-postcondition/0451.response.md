Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the initial state only mentions `sng` and `sz`, and the code snippet only contains a `break` statement, the values of `sng` and `sz` remain unchanged. The `sz` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block.
