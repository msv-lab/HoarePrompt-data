Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1**.

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. The other variables (`sng` and `elem`) remain unchanged. The condition that if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, remains intact but is not directly affected by this line of code.
