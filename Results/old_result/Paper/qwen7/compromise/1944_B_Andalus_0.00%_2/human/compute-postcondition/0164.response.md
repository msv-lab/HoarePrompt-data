Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, `sng` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `lft`, which contains the first `n` elements of `lst`. The sorting operation changes the order of elements in `lft` to be in ascending order, while the other variables remain unchanged.
