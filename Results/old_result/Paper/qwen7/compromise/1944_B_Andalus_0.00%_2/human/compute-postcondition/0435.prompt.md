Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All elements in `ldb` have been processed, `sz` is equal to the initial value of `sz` plus the total number of elements processed in `sng`, and no further elements are printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`. If `sz` is less than `k`, the postcondition remains that `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` minus 2, then `sz` is adjusted such that it is exactly `k` minus 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`. If `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k - 2`, it is now exactly `k - 2` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is less than 2, `sz` is updated to `k` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `rdb` must still contain at least one element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, no change occurs to the conditions of `sz` and `rdb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
