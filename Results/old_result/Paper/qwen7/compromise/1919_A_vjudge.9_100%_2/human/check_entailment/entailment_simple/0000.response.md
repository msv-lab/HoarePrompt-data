Reasoning:
The given solution checks whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd to determine the winner. According to the rules of the game:
1. If `a` and `b` are equal or differ by an even number, the player whose turn it is will eventually be forced to make the last move when both wallets are empty, meaning the opponent will win.
2. If `a` and `b` differ by an odd number, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position by ensuring the difference remains odd after their turn.

The logic in the annotated program correctly implements this strategy:
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it means the difference is even, and hence Bob wins.
- Otherwise, if `abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`, it means the difference is odd, and Alice wins.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, this logic aligns perfectly with the expected outcomes.

Correctness: **True**
