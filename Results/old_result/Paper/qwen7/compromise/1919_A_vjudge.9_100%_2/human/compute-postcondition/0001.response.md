Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.

3. **Current State**: 
   - `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\).
   - `t` is an input integer (no specific range given).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be a positive integer. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure it is greater than 0.

5. **Final State**: The variables `a` and `b` do not affect the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. The only variable that needs adjustment is `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
