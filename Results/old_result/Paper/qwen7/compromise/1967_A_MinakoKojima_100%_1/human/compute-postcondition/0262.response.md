Output State: **`ans_list` contains the current value of `ans`, `k` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the final value determined by the loop's logic, `dif` is `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, `res` is increased by `k % n`, `ans` is increased by `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `ans_list.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. None of the other variables (`k`, `i`, `res`, `dif`) are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated list `ans_list` containing the current value of `ans`, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
