Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `dif`, and `res` is -1.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif` adds the value of `dif` to `ans`. Given that `dif` is initially `a[2] - a[1]`, `ans` will now be `a[2] - a[1]`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
