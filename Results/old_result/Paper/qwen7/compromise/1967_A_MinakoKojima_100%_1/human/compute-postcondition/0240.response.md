Output State: **`i` is 3, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is `res - 1`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `res` is `res - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated value of `res` is its original value minus 1.
