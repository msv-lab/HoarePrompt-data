Postcondition: `i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, and `res` remains either -2 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` * (0 + 1), or -1 if `k` is 0 and `ans` is 0, indicating the end of the loop or if statement, since the condition `k == 0` is met and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
