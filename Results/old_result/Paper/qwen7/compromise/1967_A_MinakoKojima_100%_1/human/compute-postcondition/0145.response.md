Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` remains -2, and `ans` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dif` to `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. Therefore, `dif` is now `a[3] - a[2]`. The values of `i`, `res`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
