Output State: **`i` is 3, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is `res + k % (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `ans + 0`, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `k = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `k`. Since `k` was already 0, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `res`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
