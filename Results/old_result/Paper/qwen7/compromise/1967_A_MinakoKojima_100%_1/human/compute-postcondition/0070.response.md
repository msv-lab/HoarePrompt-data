Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is -3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `res` is -3. None of the variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, so their values remain unchanged.
