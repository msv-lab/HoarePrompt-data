Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is -3, `k` is `k - (a[3] - a[2]) * 3**.

Explanation: The variable `res` is decremented by 1. Initially, `res` was `-2`. After subtracting 1 from `-2`, the new value of `res` becomes `-3`. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
