Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The `ans_list` remains unchanged as it was initially an empty list. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` as input integers, while `ans_list` stays as an empty list.
