Output State: **`ans` is increased by `res`, `k` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the final value determined by the loop's logic, `dif` is `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, `res` is increased by `k % n`, `ans` is increased by `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += res` adds the value of `res` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. `k` remains 0, `i` remains `n-1`, `res` retains its final value from the loop, `dif` remains `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `res` is increased by `k % n` which is 0, and `ans` is increased by `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`.
