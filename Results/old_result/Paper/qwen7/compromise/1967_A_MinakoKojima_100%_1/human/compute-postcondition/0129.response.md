Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -2, `k` is `k - (a[2] - a[1]) * 2**.

Explanation: The code `k -= dif * (i + 1)` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from its current value. Given that `i` is 1 and `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, the expression `dif * (i + 1)` becomes `(a[2] - a[1]) * 2`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - (a[2] - a[1]) * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
