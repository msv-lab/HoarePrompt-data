### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program correctly reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This part is also correct.

3. **Conditions for Output**:
   - The condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves `b` equals the number of cubes `c`, which means Nikita can indeed end up with `c` cubes. This is correct.
   - The condition `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the number of cubes `c`. Since each move can only add or remove one cube, it's impossible to end up with more cubes than moves, so this should always return `No`. This is incorrect.
   - The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` checks if the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves `b` matches the parity of the number of cubes `c`. This is correct because the parity of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes to achieve the desired result.
   - The final `else:` block should never be reached due to the previous conditions. If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints `No`, which is correct.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the condition `elif b < c:`. It should always return `No` since it's impossible to end up with more cubes than moves.

**Correctness: **False**
