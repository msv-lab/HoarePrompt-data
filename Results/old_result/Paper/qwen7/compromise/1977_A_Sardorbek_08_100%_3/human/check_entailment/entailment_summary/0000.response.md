Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube.
2. The program logic checks several conditions:
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), it prints 'YES'.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. Let's analyze these conditions:
   - If `b` equals `c`, it means the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, which is possible. Hence, printing 'YES' is correct.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it implies there are not enough moves to reach `c` cubes, hence printing 'NO' is correct.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity, it means the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which is consistent with the operations allowed (adding or removing one cube at a time). Hence, printing 'Yes' is correct.
   - Otherwise, if `b` and `c` have different parities, it implies an odd number of moves would result in an odd number of cubes, while an even number of moves would result in an even number of cubes. Thus, printing 'No' is correct.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
