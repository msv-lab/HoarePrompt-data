Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of extroverts is odd and cannot be paired with universals to form complete tents. Specifically, in the second test case (1 4 1), the program should return -1 because 4 extroverts cannot be paired with 1 universal to form complete tents. However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results.
