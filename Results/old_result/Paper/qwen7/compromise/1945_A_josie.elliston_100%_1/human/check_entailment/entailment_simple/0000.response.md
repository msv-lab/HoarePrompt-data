Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input.
   - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it checks if `(extroverts % 3 + universals) >= 3`. If this condition is true, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`, which represents the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals.
   - If the condition is false, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals under the given constraints.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for the extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, and thus `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - If `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns a valid number of tents, it adds the number of `introverts` to this value and returns the result.

3. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in both functions correctly handles the conditions for accommodating the participants according to their preferences.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals when possible.
   - The function `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` to determine the total number of tents needed, including the introverts.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the functions is correct.

Correctness: **True**
