Output State: `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `k` must be at least \(2^i\).

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be the largest integer for which \(2^i \leq k\). The value of `k` must be at least \(2^i\), where `i` is the final value obtained from the loop.
