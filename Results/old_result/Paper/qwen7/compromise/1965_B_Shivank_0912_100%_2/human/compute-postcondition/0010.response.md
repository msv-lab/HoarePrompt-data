Output State: `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `k` must be at least \(2^i\).

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(2^{i+1} \leq k\). This means that `i` will keep increasing until doubling it would exceed `k`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be the highest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `k` must be at least \(2^i\).
