Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` in the range `range(20)`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`**: According to the given information, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range specified by `range(20)`. Since `range(20)` includes values from 0 to 19, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than 20.

4. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2 to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1]`, `j` is 3, where `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\) and `k` must be at least \(2^i\)**.
