Output State: **`ans` contains all integers from `1` to `1048576`, except for `1 << i`, `j` is 19, `i` is 20, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is 1048576.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since `k` was previously set to `1048576`, it remains unchanged. The value of `n` becomes the first integer entered by the user, and `k` becomes the second integer entered by the user. The other variables (`ans`, `j`, `i`, `tc`) retain their original values as they are not affected by the code.
