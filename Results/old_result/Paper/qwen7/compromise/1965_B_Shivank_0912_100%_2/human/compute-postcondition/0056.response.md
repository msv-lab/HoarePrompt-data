Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **List `ans`**: The list `ans` contains all integers from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, except for `1 << i`. Given that `i` remains 20 after the loop completes, it means `1 << 20` is missing from the list `ans`.

2. **Range of Integers**: The range from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` includes integers from 1 to 524288 (since `1 << 19 = 524288`).

3. **Total Number of Integers**: Normally, there would be 20 integers in this range (from 1 to 524288), but since one integer (`1 << 20`) is missing, the total number of integers in `ans` is 20 - 1 = 19.

4. **Print Statement**: The print statement `print(len(ans))` will print the length of the list `ans`.

Given the above steps, the length of the list `ans` is 19.

Output: **19**
