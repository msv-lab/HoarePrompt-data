Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(20)`. The only variable in this loop head is `j`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `i` is an integer (this is not modified by the loop)
   - `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 2]` (this is not modified by the loop)

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 20.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `i` remains an integer but its specific value is not given and does not change within the loop.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `i` is an integer, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 2]`**.
