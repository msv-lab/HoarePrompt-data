Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3, ..., 1 << 19]`, `i` is 1, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` must be at least 2**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
