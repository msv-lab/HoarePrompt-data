Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Understanding `k`**: 
   - `k` must be at least \(2^i\), where \(i\) is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\). This means \(k\) is a power of 2 itself, specifically \(k = 2^{19}\) because \(j = 19\).

2. **Constructing the list `ans`**:
   - The list `ans` contains the following elements:
     - \(k - (1 << i)\): This is \(2^{19} - 2^i\).
     - \(k + 1\): This is \(2^{19} + 1\).
     - \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\): This is \(2^{19} + 1 + 2^i\).
     - \(1\): This is just the number 1.
     - \(1 << 1\): This is \(2\).
     - \(1 << 3\): This is \(8\).
     - ...
     - \(1 << 19\): This is \(2^{20}\).

3. **Counting the elements in `ans`**:
   - There are 7 elements explicitly listed in the initial state: \(k - (1 << i)\), \(k + 1\), \(k + 1 + (1 << i)\), 1, \(1 << 1\), \(1 << 3\), and \(1 << 19\).
   - Therefore, the length of the list `ans` is 7.

Given this analysis, the print statement `print(len(ans))` will output the length of the list `ans`.

Output: **7**
