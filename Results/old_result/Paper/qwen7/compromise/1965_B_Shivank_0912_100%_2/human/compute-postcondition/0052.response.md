Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is an integer, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 2, 4]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 2, `1 << j` equals `1 << 2`, which is 4. Therefore, the list `ans` is updated to include 4, making it `[2, 2, 4]`. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged.
