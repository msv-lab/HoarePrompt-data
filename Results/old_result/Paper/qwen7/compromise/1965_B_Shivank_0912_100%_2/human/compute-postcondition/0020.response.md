Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1]`, `j` is 2**.

Explanation: The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1. After executing `ans.append(1 << j)`, `j` increments by 1 (becoming 2) because the operation modifies `j` in place. The list `ans` now includes the additional element `1 << 1`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
