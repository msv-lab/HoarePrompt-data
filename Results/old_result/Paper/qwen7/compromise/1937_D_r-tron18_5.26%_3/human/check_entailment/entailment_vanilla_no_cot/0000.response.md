Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not used appropriately, and the overall logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is not used in a way that aligns with the problem requirements. It seems to be an attempt to calculate some kind of index or distance, but its implementation and usage do not match the problem's needs.

2. **Logic Flaws:** The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is complex and incorrect. The code attempts to handle different cases based on the direction of the pinball (`>` or `<`), but the calculations do not accurately reflect the movement and inversion rules described in the problem statement.

3. **Missing Key Steps:** The solution is missing key steps such as properly handling the inversion of the grid cells and accurately calculating the time taken for the pinball to move and stop.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the movement of the pinball for each starting position, taking into account the inversion of the grid cells after each move. This involves iterating through the grid for each starting position and updating the positions until the pinball leaves the grid, keeping track of the time taken for each case.
