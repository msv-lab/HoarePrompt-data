Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins across different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means we need to find a distribution \(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\) where the sum of \(x_i\) is less than \(k_i \cdot x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers, `prod`.
   - It then calculates an array `vprod` where each element is `prod // k_i`.
   - It computes `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating `vprod` is flawed. The idea is to ensure that the total bet is less than the payout for any outcome. However, the current approach does not guarantee this.
   - The calculation of `den` is also problematic because it doesn't directly relate to ensuring the total bet is less than the payout for any outcome.
   - The solution should instead aim to find a valid distribution where the sum of \(x_i\) is less than \(k_i \cdot x_i\) for all \(i\). This typically involves finding a feasible set of \(x_i\) values that satisfy this condition.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve setting \(x_i = k_i - 1\) for all \(i\). This ensures that the total bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^n (k_i - 1) \), which is strictly less than \( \sum_{i=1}^n k_i \cdot (k_i - 1) \) for any \(k_i \geq 2\).

Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
