Output State: **`vals` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`, `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`**.

This means that the variable `den` has been calculated as the difference between the product of all elements in the list `vals` (`prod`) and the sum of the list `vprod` where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. All other variables remain in their initial state.
