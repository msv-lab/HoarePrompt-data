Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three parameters: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (an integer between 2 and 10^8), and k (an integer between 1 and 4n - 2). It returns different outputs based on the values of n and k. Specifically, if k is less than 2n, it returns "Case_1"; if k is between 2n and 3n - 1, it returns "Case_2"; if k is between 3n and 4n - 2, it returns "Case_3".**
