Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `k // 2 + 1` or `ceil(k / 2)`, depending on whether the condition `4 * n - 2 == k` is met for each iteration. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Each line corresponds to the result of one iteration of the loop, with `n` and `k` being the values entered for that iteration.
