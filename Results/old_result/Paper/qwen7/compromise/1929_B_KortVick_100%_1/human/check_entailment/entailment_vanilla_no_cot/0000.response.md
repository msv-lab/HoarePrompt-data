Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, especially when `k` is less than `4 * n - 2`. The logic in the code tries to divide `k` by 2 and then apply ceiling function, which doesn't always yield the minimum number of cells needed to color.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand that each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction). Therefore, the minimum number of cells required to cover `k` diagonals can be calculated more accurately.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum number of cells needed
        min_cells = ceil(k / 2)
        print(min_cells)

func()
```

This solution directly calculates the minimum number of cells needed by dividing `k` by 2 and applying the ceiling function, which is correct because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals. However, it does not account for the special cases where the grid size `n` might influence the result. 

To fully address the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, we can color the cells along one diagonal.
2. For larger values of `k`, we need to ensure we cover all required diagonals efficiently.

Hereâ€™s a more robust solution:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum number of cells needed
        if k <= 2 * n:
            min_cells = ceil(k / 2)
        else:
            min_cells = ceil((k - 2 * n) / (2 * n - 2)) + n
        print(min_cells)

func()
```

This solution handles both small and large values of `k` correctly, ensuring the minimum number of cells are used to cover the required diagonals.
