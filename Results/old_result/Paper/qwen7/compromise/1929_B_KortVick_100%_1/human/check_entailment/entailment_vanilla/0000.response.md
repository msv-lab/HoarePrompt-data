### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution uses a function `func()` to process the input and calculate the result.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).

3. **Key Logic in the Code:**
   - If \( 4n - 2 \) is equal to \( k \), it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

4. **Verification of the Logic:**
   - When \( 4n - 2 = k \):
     - The formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) simplifies to \( \frac{4n - 2}{2} + 1 = 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \). This means we need to color \( 2n \) cells.
     - Since each diagonal must have at least one colored cell, and there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, coloring \( 2n \) cells ensures that each diagonal will have at least one colored cell.
   - When \( 4n - 2 \neq k \):
     - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) ensures that we color the minimum number of cells needed to satisfy the condition \( k \) diagonals having at least one colored cell.
     - This is because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \) and when \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 2 \).

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly calculates the minimum number of cells to color based on the conditions specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
