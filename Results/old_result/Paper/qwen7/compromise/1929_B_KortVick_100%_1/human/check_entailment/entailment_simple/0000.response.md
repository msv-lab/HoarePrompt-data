Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, the program correctly initializes `n` and `k` from the input.
3. **Logic for Coloring Cells**:
   - If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is correct because in this scenario, the number of diagonals is exactly `4 * n - 2`, and we need to color enough cells to cover all these diagonals. Since each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal), the formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that we cover all diagonals.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `ceil(k / 2)`. This is also correct because in other scenarios, we need to color cells to cover at least `k` diagonals. The ceiling function ensures that we round up to the nearest whole number, ensuring we cover the required diagonals.

Given the analysis above, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and produces the correct outputs for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
