Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses a lambda function `r` to read input and processes the data in a way that does not align with the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Distances**: The program attempts to calculate distances using a series of comparisons and arithmetic operations, but these do not accurately reflect the logic needed to determine the closest city and the cost of traveling to it.

2. **Lambda Function Usage**: The lambda function `r` reads input in a way that does not match the expected format. It reads multiple integers at once, but the problem requires processing each test case individually.

3. **Distance Calculation Logic**: The logic inside the loop to calculate distances and costs is flawed. It does not correctly handle the unique closest city requirement and the specific cost calculation rules.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
