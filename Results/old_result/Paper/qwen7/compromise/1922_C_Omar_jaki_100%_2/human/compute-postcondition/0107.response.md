Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`, `t` is false, `a` must have at least 6 elements, `b` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x)]`, `v` is `y - x`, `b[-2]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[-1]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[2]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[3]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[4]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `u` is true, and if `c` is less than `d`, `total` remains 0; if `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, `total` remains 0.**
