Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, where `n` is the total number of iterations, `a` is a tuple with at least `n + 3` elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]` extended for each iteration, and `v` is `y - x`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `t` will have decreased by `2 * n`, where `n` is the total number of times the loop has executed. The variable `a` remains as an initial tuple but with at least `n + 3` elements since it is used in the loop. The list `b` is updated for each iteration based on the conditions provided in the loop body. The variable `v` is calculated as `y - x` for each iteration.
