Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is `t - 2`
- `a` is a tuple of at least 4 elements
- `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v]`

### Loop Head:
```
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over tuples `(w, x, y, z)` where each tuple is generated by `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`.
   - This means `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are derived from the elements of `a`.

2. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `a`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `a`.
   - The other variables (`t`, `b`) are not directly affected by the loop and remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must still be a tuple of at least 4 elements.

### New State:
- `t` remains `t - 2`
- `a` must be a tuple of at least 5 elements (since the loop advances by one element each time)
- `b` remains `[0, 0, b[-2] + v]`

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `a` is a tuple of at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v]`**
