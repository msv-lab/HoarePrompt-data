Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero).

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `t` is reduced to the first value from the input split by spaces.
   - `n`, `a`, `m` remain unchanged.
   - `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is the first value from the input split by spaces, it must be a non-zero value.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be non-zero**
