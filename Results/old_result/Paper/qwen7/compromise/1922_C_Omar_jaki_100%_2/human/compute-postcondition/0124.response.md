Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined set of inputs: an integer t, an integer n, a list a of n integers, and an integer m. Each of the m queries consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i. The function returns different values based on the queries.**

- The function processes an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- It also processes an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- A list `a` of `n` integers is given, where \(0 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^9\).
- An integer `m` is processed such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- For each of the `m` queries, the function takes two distinct integers `x_i` and `y_i` where \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n\), and returns a value based on these inputs.
