Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `a` is a tuple of at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]`, `v` is `y - x`**.

Explanation:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is simply referenced and not reassigned.
- `a` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it.
- `b` is updated according to the given operations. Initially, `b` is defined as `[0, 0, b[-2] + v]`. After the operations, `b` becomes `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]`. Here, `b[-2]` is `b[2]`, which is `b[-2] + v`, and `b[-1]` is `b[3]`, which is `b[-2] + v`.
- `v` remains unchanged as it is only used in the operations and not redefined.
