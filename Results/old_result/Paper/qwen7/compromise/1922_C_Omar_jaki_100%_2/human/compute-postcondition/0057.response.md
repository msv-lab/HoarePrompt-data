Output State: **`v` is equal to `y - x`, `a` must have at least 5 elements, `w` is the first element of `a`, `x` is the second element of `a`, `y` is the third element of `a`, `z` is the fourth element of `a`**.

Explanation: The code `v = y - x` calculates the difference between `y` and `x` and assigns the result to `v`. The values of `a`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `a` must have at least 5 elements is still valid.
