Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `a` is a tuple of at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v]`, `v` is `y - x`**.

In this output state, the value of `t` is updated to `t - 2`. The tuple `a` remains unchanged, and `b` is defined as a list with the first two elements being 0, the third element being the sum of the second last element of `b` and `v`, and `v` is calculated as `y - x`.
