You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and the encoded string itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an encoded string `s` as input.
   - It extracts all unique characters from `s` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `unique_chars`.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse `unique_chars` from both ends.
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and replaces it with the corresponding character from `unique_chars` based on the symmetry (i.e., the character at position `j`).
   - If a character in `s` is not found in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character into `unique_chars` at position `i` and increments both `i` and `j`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to encode a string, not decode it. The logic in `func_1` is incorrect for decoding.
   - Specifically, the function tries to replace characters in `s` with characters from `unique_chars`, but it does not handle the decoding process correctly.
   - The function does not reverse the mapping that was used during encoding. Instead, it attempts to insert new characters into `unique_chars`, which is not the intended behavior for decoding.

### Correct Decoding Logic

To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:
1. Extract all unique characters from the encoded string and sort them alphabetically.
2. Create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the sorted unique characters.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[i] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars[::-1])}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Input Reading**: Same as the original program.
2. **Function `decode_string`**:
   - Extracts all unique characters from `s` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - Creates a mapping where each character in the encoded string is mapped to its corresponding character in the sorted unique characters (using the reversed order).
   - Uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_1` is designed to encode, not decode. The corrected program above should be used instead.
