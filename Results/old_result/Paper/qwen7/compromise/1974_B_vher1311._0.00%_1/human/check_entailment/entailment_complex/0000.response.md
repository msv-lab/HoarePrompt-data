Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` aims to decode the string `s` by reversing the encoding process.
2. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Instead of replacing each character in `s` with the corresponding character from the sorted list of unique characters, it incorrectly tries to replace characters and modify the sorted list of unique characters simultaneously.
3. Specifically, the loop in `func_1` should map each character in `s` to its corresponding character in the sorted list of unique characters, but the current implementation does not correctly achieve this mapping.
4. The state after the function call shows `i` is 0 and `j` is -1, indicating that the function did not properly decode the string.
5. The function's logic is incorrect because it attempts to insert characters into the `unique_chars` list while also trying to replace characters in `s`, leading to an incorrect result.

Correctness: **False**
