Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l <= r`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l <= r` must be true.
   - Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - Since `0 <= n - 1` (assuming `n` is a positive integer), the condition `l <= r` is already satisfied.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - No adjustments are necessary for the variables `l` and `r` because the loop condition is already met with the given values.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, and `r` is n - 1**
