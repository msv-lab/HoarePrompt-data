Output State: The output state consists of 'yes' or 'no' printed for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop. For each test case, if both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between `a` and `b` is equal to `-a` or `-b`, it prints 'no'. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.
