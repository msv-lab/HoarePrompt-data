Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Analysis of the Given Program

The program iterates over multiple test cases and processes each test case with two integers \(a\) and \(b\). Here is the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Check if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even:**
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This part is correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

2. **Check if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is equal to \(-a\) or \(-b\):**
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   This part is incorrect. The tuple construction `(-a, a)` and `(b, -b)` does not make sense here. Instead, it should simply check if \(a - b = -a\) or \(b - a = -b\), which simplifies to checking if \(a = b\).

3. **Check if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd:**
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This part is also incorrect. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true because any non-zero integer modulo 2 will either be 0 or 1. This means the condition will always evaluate to `True`, leading to unnecessary `yes` outputs.

4. **Default case:**
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   This part is redundant due to the previous incorrect conditions.

### Correct Approach

Based on the problem description, the correct approach should be:
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, print 'yes'.
- If \(a = b\), print 'no'.
- If at least one of \(a\) or \(b\) is odd, print 'no'.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == b:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Evaluation

Given the corrected program, let's re-evaluate the original assessment:

- The original assessment stated that the program fails to handle the case where both dimensions are odd, which is incorrect. The corrected program now handles this case correctly.
- The original assessment also pointed out issues with the logic for even dimensions and the difference check, which are now fixed.

Since the corrected program now correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
