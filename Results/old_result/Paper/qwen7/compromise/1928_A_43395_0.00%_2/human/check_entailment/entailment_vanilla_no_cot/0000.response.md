Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Even Dimensions:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` should be handled separately, but the logic inside this block is incorrect. If both dimensions are even, the program prints 'yes', which is incorrect. For example, a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle can be split into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, but the logic here does not account for this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Differences:**
   - The conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and do not make sense. These conditions should be simplified to check if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, which would indicate that it's possible to form another rectangle.

3. **Incorrect Use of Modulo Operation:**
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant and incorrect. The modulo operation will always return a non-negative remainder, so `(a - b) % 2 > 0` is the correct way to check if the difference is odd.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('No')
        elif (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0) or ((a - b) % 2 == 1):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Check if \(a\) and \(b\) are Equal:**
   - If \(a\) and \(b\) are equal, it's impossible to form another rectangle since cutting will result in two identical smaller rectangles.

2. **Check if Both Dimensions are Even:**
   - If both dimensions are even, it's possible to form another rectangle by cutting into smaller rectangles with at least one dimension odd.

3. **Check if the Difference Between Dimensions is Odd:**
   - If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it's possible to form another rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

This corrected implementation handles all the edge cases and logical conditions correctly.
