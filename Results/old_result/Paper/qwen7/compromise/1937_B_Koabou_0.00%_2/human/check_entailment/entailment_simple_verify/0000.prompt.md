You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

    00
    
    4

    1100

    00100111
    
    11101101

Output

    000
    2
    11000
    1

    4
    
Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings of length n are provided representing the values of a_{1j} and a_{2j} for 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `x-1`. If the substring of `a[0]` up to index `i+1` matches the substring of `s` up to index `i+1`, it sets `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop. Since the loop head specifies `i` in `range(x)`, the maximum value for `i` is `x-1`. Therefore, the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` can only match if `a[0]` and `s` are identical or if they start with the same prefix up to some point. However, without specific values for `a[0]` and `s`, we cannot determine the exact value of `t` after the loop. Given the initial state and the loop logic, `t` remains 1 unless a match is found within the loop, but since no specific values are provided, we assume no match is found, keeping `t` at its initial value of 1. Other variables remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

    #This is printed: [s]
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the program does not consider all possible paths from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell and does not ensure that the string is constructed correctly according to the rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
1101
1100
8
00100111
11101101
```

The expected output should be:
```
11000
1
001001101
4
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results. For instance, in the second test case, the program constructs the string `11000` but does not account for the possibility of constructing the lexicographically smallest string `001001101` with 4 different paths. The program's logic for constructing the string and counting the paths is flawed and does not handle all possible paths correctly.
