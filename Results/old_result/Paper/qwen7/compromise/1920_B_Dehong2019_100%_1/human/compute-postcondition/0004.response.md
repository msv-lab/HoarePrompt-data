Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on user input**.

Explanation: The code takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, and then sorts them in descending order using `sorted(..., reverse=True)`. The sorted list is assigned to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
