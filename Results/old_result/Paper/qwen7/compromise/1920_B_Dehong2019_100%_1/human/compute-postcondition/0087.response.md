Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is 0, `ans2` is 0, `i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans2 = ans1` assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Since `ans1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of all elements in `a`, which simplifies to 0, `ans2` also becomes 0. The loop and its operations do not affect `i` and `x`, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `ans1` and `ans2`, while keeping the initial values of `a`, `i`, and `x`.
