Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increases the value of `ans1` by `a[i]`. The other variables (`ans2`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition `if i + x < n` is not evaluated here, so the subsequent operations related to this condition (decreasing `ans1` and updating `ans2`) are not performed.
