Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus four times the element at index 2 minus twice the element at index 3, `ans2` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: 
- The variable `ans1` was initially the sum of all elements in `a` minus four times the element at index 2. After executing `ans1 -= a[i] * 2`, `ans1` is now the sum of all elements in `a` minus four times the element at index 2 minus twice the element at index 3 (since `i` is now 3).
- All other variables (`a`, `ans2`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
