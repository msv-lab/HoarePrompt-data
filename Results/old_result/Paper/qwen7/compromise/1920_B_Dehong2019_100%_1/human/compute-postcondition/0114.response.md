Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of n integers, where each integer is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and three additional positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. The function returns a value based on specific conditions involving these inputs.**

This means the function processes a list of integers along with three other integers and returns a result based on the given constraints and relationships between the inputs.
