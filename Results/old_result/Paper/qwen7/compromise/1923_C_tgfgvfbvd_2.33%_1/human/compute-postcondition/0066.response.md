Output State: `m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, the list `l` must be non-empty, and the list `p` now contains all cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in the list `l`. The list `p` will contain each cumulative sum of the elements in `l` as it was appended in each iteration of the loop. The value of `a` and `b` will be decreased by the number of iterations, and `s` will be calculated based on the last element in `p` and the value of `m` and the second-to-last element in `p`.
