Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `p[b - 1]` is decreased by `p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2 < 0`, then no change is made to `p[b - 1]`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and any changes to the list `p` do not affect this particular print statement.

Output: **YES**
