Output State: **`l` is the list without the first element; `c` is the sum of the elements in `l` starting from the second element; `p` contains the value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. `c` is defined as the sum of the elements in `l` starting from the second element. The state of `l` and the calculation of `c` remain unchanged, but now `p` contains the value of `c`.
