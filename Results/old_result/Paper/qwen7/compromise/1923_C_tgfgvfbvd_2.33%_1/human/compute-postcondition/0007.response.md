Output State: **`c` is increased by `x`, `l` must not be empty, `p` contains the value of `c`**.

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` was already increased by `x` in the initial state and `l` must not be empty (though it's not directly affected by the code), the only change is that `p` now contains the value of `c`.
