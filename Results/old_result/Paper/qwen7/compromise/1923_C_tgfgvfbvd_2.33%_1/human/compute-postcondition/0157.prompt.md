Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    c = 0
    for x in l:
        c += x
        p.append(c)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        s = p[b - 1]
        if a - 2 >= 0:
            s -= p[a - 2]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be 0, `a` will be an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` will be an input integer, `s` will be equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, and the current value of `a` will be greater than or equal to `2 - m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be 0, `a` will be `input_integer - number_of_iterations`, `b` will be `input_integer - number_of_iterations`, `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `s` will be `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, and the list `p` will contain all cumulative sums of the elements in `l` as they were appended in each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The final output state will be such that `m` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `a` and `b` will hold the last pair of integers input during the loop's execution, and `s` will be equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` will be decreased by the element at index `a - 2` of the list `p`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged after the last iteration. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in the list `l` up to each index, and `c` will remain as the sum of all elements in the original list `l`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `m` reflects the total number of times the loop ran, `a` and `b` capture the parameters of the last input pair, `s` is adjusted based on the conditions specified in the loop, and `p` and `c` retain their respective cumulative and total sum properties from the initial setup.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
