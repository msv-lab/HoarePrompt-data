Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`, `b` is `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from user input, `p` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `p = []` creates an empty list `p`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
