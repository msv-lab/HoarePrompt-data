Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 2` of the list `p`, `s` is decreased by the element at index `a - 2` of the list `p`.**

Explanation: The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
