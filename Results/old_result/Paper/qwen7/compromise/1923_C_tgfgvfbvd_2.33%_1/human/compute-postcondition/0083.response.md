Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `m`. The loop will continue as long as `m` is greater than 0.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 0.

3. **Check the Given Postcondition**: The postcondition at the end of the previous iteration includes several conditions about the variables `m`, `l`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. However, these conditions are not directly relevant to determining the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop. We only need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the only variable in the loop head is `m`, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `m` is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
