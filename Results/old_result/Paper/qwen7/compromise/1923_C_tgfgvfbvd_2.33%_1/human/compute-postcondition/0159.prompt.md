You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will reflect the total number of queries processed, `a` and `b` will hold the parameters of the last query, `s` will be equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, otherwise it will just be `p[b - 1]`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in the list `l` up to each index, and `c` will remain as the sum of all elements in the original list `l`. The variable `n` will remain unchanged as it is determined by the input and not modified within the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running through all the iterations, `m` will show how many times the inner loop ran (i.e., how many queries there were), `a` and `b` will be the values from the last query, `s` will be calculated based on the cumulative sums stored in `p` and the number of queries, `p` will store the cumulative sums of the input list `l`, and `c` will still be the total sum of all elements in `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by inputs including a positive integer `t`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it checks the sum of elements in the sublist of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` and returns the results accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
