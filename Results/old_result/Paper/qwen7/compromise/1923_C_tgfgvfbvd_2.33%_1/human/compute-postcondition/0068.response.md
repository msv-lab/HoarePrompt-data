Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `l` must be non-empty; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial conditions for `m` and `l` remain unchanged.
