Output State: **`m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `l` is a list of integers converted from the input split by space**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input from the user split by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The variable `m` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
