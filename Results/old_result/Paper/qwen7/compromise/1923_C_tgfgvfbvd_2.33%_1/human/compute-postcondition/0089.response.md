Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects whose values need to be explicitly described since the print statement does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or `s`.

Output: **YES**
