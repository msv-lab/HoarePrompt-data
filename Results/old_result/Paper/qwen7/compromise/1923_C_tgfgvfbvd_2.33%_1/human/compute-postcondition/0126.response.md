Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, then `s` is decreased by `p[a - 2]`. Additionally, `s` is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray from index `a-1` to index `b-1` (inclusive).
