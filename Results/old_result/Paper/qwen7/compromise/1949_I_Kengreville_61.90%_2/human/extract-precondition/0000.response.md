Precondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` and `y` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the initial radii of the disks, and `visited`, `nodes`, and `coef0`, `coef1` are lists of length `n` initialized to `False`, an empty list, and zeros respectively.**
