Output State: **`nodes` must have at least one element; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]'**

Explanation: The variable `c1` is incremented by the value of `coef1[j]`. The variable `c0` was previously increased by `coef0[j]`, but this operation does not affect `c1`. The precondition that `nodes` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
