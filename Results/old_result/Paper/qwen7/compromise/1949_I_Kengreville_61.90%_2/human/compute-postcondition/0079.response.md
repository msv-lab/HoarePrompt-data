Output State: **`ok` is `ok` or `c1` is not equal to 0, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `nodes` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code `ok = ok or c1 != 0` updates the value of `ok`. Since `c1` is initially 1 (as per the initial state), `c1 != 0` evaluates to `True`. Therefore, `ok` will be updated to `True` if it was `False` before, or it will remain `True` if it was already `True`. The values of `i`, `coef0[1]`, `coef1[1]`, and `nodes` remain unchanged.
