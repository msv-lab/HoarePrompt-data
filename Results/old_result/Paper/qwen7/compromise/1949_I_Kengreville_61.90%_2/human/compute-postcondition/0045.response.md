Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `ok` is now `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`, `coef0[0]` is 0, `coef1[0]` is 1, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`, and `coef1[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function call is made, but without knowing the implementation details of the `dfs` function, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. However, since no variables are modified within the given code snippet, the values of all variables remain unchanged. The only thing that happens is the execution of the `dfs` function with the argument `i`, which is 1. Since the function's behavior is not specified, we assume no direct modification to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
