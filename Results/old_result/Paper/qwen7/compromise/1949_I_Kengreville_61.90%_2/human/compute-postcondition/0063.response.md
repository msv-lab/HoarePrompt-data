Output State: **`nodes` must contain at least three elements, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `coef1[i] = 1` sets the value of `coef1[i]` to 1. Given that `i` was incremented by 1 before this line, `i` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code.
