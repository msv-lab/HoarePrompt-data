Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `ok` is now `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`, `coef0[0]` is 0, `coef1[0]` is 1, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, and `coef1[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `c1 = 0` sets the value of `c1` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
