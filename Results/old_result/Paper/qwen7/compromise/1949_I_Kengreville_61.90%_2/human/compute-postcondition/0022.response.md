Output State: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` remains unchanged, `j` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, `visited[j]` must be false, and the new value of `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dx` to be `x[i] - x[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and preconditions related to `n`, `k`, `j`, and `visited[j]` still hold true.
