Output State: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` is a list of length `n` containing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `y` is a list of length `n` containing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the initial radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`, `nodes` is a list with the element `i` appended, `coef0` is a list of length `n` initialized to zeros, `coef1` is a list of length `n` initialized to zeros, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the x-coordinate of the disk at index `i` and the x-coordinate of the disk at index `j` and assigns it to the variable `dx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
