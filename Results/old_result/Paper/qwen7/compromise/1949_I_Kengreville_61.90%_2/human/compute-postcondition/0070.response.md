Output State: **`c0` is 0, `c1` is 1, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `c1 += coef1[j]` increments `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given that `j` is 0 (since `i` is 2 and `coef0[1]` is 0, making `j` equal to 0), `c1` is incremented by `coef1[0]`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
