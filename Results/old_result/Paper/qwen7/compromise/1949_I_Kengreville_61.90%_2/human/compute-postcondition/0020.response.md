Postcondition: `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`; if `visited[j]` is false and the distance condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` is satisfied, then `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`, and the function `dfs(j)` is called. If the distance condition is not satisfied or `visited[j]` is true, no changes are made to `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]`.
