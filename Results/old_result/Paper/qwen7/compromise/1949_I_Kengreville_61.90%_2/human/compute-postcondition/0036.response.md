Output State: All variables outside the loop remain unchanged. Specifically, `i` is still 0; `n` is still a positive integer; `coef0[0]` is still 0; `coef1[0]` is still 1; the current value of `visited[0]` is still True; `nodes` is still a list containing node 0; `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, which is `coef0[0] + coef0[1] + ... + coef0[k]` where `k` is the number of nodes in the list; `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, which is `coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]` where `k` is the number of nodes in the list.

This means `c0` will be the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`, and `c1` will be the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.
