Postcondition: `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` is a list of length `n` containing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `y` is a list of length `n` containing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the initial radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True` except for the `j`-th element which is now `False`, `nodes` is a list with the element `i` appended, `coef0` is a list of length `n` initialized to zeros, `coef1` is a list of length `n` initialized to zeros, `j` is 0, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. The condition `(not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)` is satisfied.
