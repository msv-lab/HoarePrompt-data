Based on the initial state provided:

- `coef0` and `coef1` are lists where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `nodes` is a list of nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop.
- `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for each node `j` in `nodes`.
- `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for each node `j` in `nodes`.
- `ok` remains unchanged as the sum of `coef1[j]` for any `j` in `nodes` is equal to 0.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since no variables or objects need to be evaluated further and the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **NO**
