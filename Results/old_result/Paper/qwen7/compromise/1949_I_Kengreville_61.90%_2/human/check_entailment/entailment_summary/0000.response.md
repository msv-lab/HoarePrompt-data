Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function reads the input and initializes necessary variables. It then iterates over each disk to perform a DFS if the disk has not been visited yet. During the DFS, it checks if the disks are tangent to each other and updates coefficients accordingly. The key logic is to ensure that for any connected component of tangent disks, the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero, which would allow decreasing the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.
2. **Function `dfs()`**: This function performs a DFS to explore the graph of disks where two disks are connected if they are tangent to each other. It updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values based on the tangency condition. Specifically, if two disks are tangent, the `coef0` and `coef1` values are updated such that the sum of the radii minus the `coef0` value of one disk gives the `coef1` value of the other disk.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic in both functions appears to correctly implement the required conditions:
- Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
- No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
- The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The first example demonstrates a valid case where the radii can be adjusted to satisfy the conditions, and the second example shows a case where it is not possible to adjust the radii to meet the conditions.

Based on the provided code and the execution summaries, the functions appear to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
