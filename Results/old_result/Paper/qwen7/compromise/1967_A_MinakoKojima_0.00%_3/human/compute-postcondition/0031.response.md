Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input followed by a space and then the second integer `k`, `a` is a list containing two integers where the first one is `n` and the second one is `k`, `m` is the minimum of `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is `n!`. Otherwise, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`, `ans` will be the cumulative product of `(a[i] - a[i-1])` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and `k` and `m` will retain their initial values.
