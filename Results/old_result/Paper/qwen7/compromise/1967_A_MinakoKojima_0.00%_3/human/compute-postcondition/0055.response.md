Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently `1`.
   - `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `1` and increments by `1` each time, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`, so for the loop to continue, `1 < n` must hold true.

6. **Adjust the States**: We need to update the state such that `i` is set to `2` and the condition `1 < n` is maintained.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`, and `n` must be greater than 1**.
