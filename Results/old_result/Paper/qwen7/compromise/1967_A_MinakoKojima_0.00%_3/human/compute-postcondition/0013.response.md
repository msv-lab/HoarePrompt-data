Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is reduced by min(`k`, `m + k // n - a[i]`), `a[i]` is `m + min(`k`, `m + k // n - a[i])`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` from its current value. The value of `i` remains 0, `n` remains the first integer input, and `a[i]` remains `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`. The other variables are not affected.
