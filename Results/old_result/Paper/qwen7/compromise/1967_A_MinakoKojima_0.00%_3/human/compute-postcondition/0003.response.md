Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer input followed by a space and then the second integer `k`; `a` is a list containing two integers, the first one is `n` and the second one is `k`; `m` is the minimum of `n` and `k`.**

Explanation: The code `m = min(a)` assigns the minimum value between `n` and `k` (which are the elements in the list `a`) to the variable `m`. Since `n` and `k` are the only elements in the list `a`, `m` will take the smaller of the two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
