Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. Therefore, the variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 1.

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**.
