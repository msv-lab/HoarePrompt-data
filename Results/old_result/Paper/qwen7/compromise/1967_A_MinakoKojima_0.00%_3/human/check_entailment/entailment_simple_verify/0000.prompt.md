You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the last integer input for the nth iteration; `k` is the last integer input for the kth iteration; `a` is a list of integers representing the last input list for the nth iteration; `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`; `ans` is the final calculated answer based on the conditions inside the loop. If `k` was greater than or equal to `n * m` throughout all iterations, `ans` will be the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` will be the cumulative product of differences between consecutive elements of the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum score for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the number of cards of a particular type is less than `m` (the minimum number of cards of any type). 

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
1
3 4
2 1 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
6
```

- Program Output:
```
12
```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum score. The correct approach would be to consider how many additional cards of each type are needed to form complete permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`. The program should adjust the counts of cards to ensure that after buying up to `k` cards, the number of cards of each type is sufficient to form the required permutations.

The program fails to correctly adjust the counts of cards to achieve the maximum score in such scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
