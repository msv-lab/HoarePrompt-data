Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. However, this logic is incomplete. According to the problem description, a rectangle can only be divided into two smaller rectangles if at least one of its dimensions is even. If both dimensions are odd, no further division is possible without creating rectangles that cannot be reformed into a different rectangle.

A counterexample where the program fails:
- Consider the input `3 3`. Both dimensions are odd. The program would incorrectly print 'Yes' because it checks if either dimension is even, which is false in this case. However, from a 3x3 rectangle, no other rectangle can be formed as explained in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd, leading to incorrect outputs in such scenarios.
