Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
2. **Condition Check**: For each pair \((a, b)\), the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
3. **Output**: The program outputs the result for each test case as required.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct. The program correctly identifies whether a rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and reassembled into a different rectangle, based on the condition that at least one of the dimensions must be even.

Correctness: **True**
