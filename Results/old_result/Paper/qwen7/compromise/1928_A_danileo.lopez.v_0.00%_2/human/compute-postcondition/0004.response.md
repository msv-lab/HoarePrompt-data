Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, it processes pairs of positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each pair, the function performs some unspecified operation and returns the result based on the input pairs.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases, each containing a value for `t` and multiple pairs of `a` and `b`. The function then processes each pair `(a, b)` according to some logic and aggregates or returns the results accordingly. However, without specific details on the operations performed on `a` and `b`, the exact functionality cannot be precisely defined.
