State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it will iterate.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive) does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is 0 or negative.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.

Hence, the state to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
