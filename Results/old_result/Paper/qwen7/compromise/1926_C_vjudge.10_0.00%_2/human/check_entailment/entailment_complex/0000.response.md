Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. It attempts to read `N` test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` and calls `func_1(i)` for every `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This is incorrect because the problem requires replacing each integer from 1 to `n` with the sum of its digits, not iterating through all numbers up to `n`.

2. The function `func_1` is defined correctly to compute the sum of the digits of a given number `n`.

3. The main part of the program should iterate from 1 to `n` and replace each number with the sum of its digits, then add that sum to `soma`.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem statement properly.

Correctness: **False**
