Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `soma` to 0.
   - It reads the number of test cases `N`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program then iterates over all integers from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i`, it calls the function `func_1(i)` and adds the result to `soma`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - This is done by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing these values.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Range of Iteration:**
   - The program iterates over the range `range(n)`, which means it will iterate from 0 to `n-1`.
   - However, the problem statement requires replacing each integer from 1 to `n` with the sum of its digits.
   - Therefore, the iteration should start from 1 instead of 0.

2. **Incorrect Summation:**
   - The program sums the results of `func_1(i)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, but it should sum the results of `func_1(i)` for `i` from 1 to `n`.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 to n
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
    soma = 0  # Reset soma for the next test case

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))
```

### Conclusion

The original program has an issue with the range of the loop, which leads to incorrect summation. After correcting the range, the program should work as expected.

**Correctness: **False**
