Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is incremented by 1, but since `z` is not used in the print statement, it does not affect the output.
- `t` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement either.
- `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, where the first element is `n` and the second element is `k`.

The print statement is `print(len(a))`, which will print the length of the list `a`.

Since `a` is a list with at least two elements (as it contains `n` and `k`), the length of `a` is 2.

Output: **2**
