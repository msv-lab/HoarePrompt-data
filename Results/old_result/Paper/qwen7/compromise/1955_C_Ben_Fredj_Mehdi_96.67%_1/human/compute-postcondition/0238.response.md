Output State: **`a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 4`, `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 3`, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` equals 0, and `d` is decreased by 1 if `a[d]` equals 0.**

Explanation: 
- The code `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` decreases the value of `a[d]` by 1. Since `a[d]` was previously `int(a[d]) - 2`, it now becomes `int(a[d]) - 3`.
- The other conditions (`a[g]` being checked for 0 and `d` being checked for 0) remain the same as they were not directly affected by the code. `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains unchanged.
