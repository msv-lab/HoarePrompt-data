Output State: **t is an input integer, and we are about to read the next input values for n and k, and the list a.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input for `t`. The initial state of `t` being an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is maintained, but now `t` holds the specific value input by the user. The subsequent inputs for `n`, `k`, and the list `a` are yet to be read.
