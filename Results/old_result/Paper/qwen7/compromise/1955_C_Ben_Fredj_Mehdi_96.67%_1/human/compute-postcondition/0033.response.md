Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant for this specific print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and it is explicitly stated that `n` is 101.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and it is explicitly stated that `k` is 100000000000.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, but its exact content is not needed for this specific print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('1')
```

This statement will simply print the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
