Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) for each t, and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each case involves an integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, then for each of those, it processes n, k, and a list of integers a, and returns a specific result for each case.
