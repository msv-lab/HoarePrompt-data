Based on the initial state provided, the variables and their values are as follows:
- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and its value is 20.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and its value is 10000000000.

The print statement is:
```python
print('10')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'10'`.

Output: **10**
