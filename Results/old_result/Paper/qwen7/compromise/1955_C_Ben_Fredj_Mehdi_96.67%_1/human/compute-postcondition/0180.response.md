Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, and the value of `k` remains unchanged under the following conditions:
- If `k` equals 1999999998, `k` remains 1999999998.
- If `k` equals 1999999999, `k` remains 1999999999.
- If `k` equals 99999999999, `k` remains 99999999999.
- If `k` equals 1 and the first element of `a` equals 1, `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged and is not equal to 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, or the second element of `a` minus 2.
- Additionally, if `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, `d` is set to `len(a) - k // 2 - 1`, `g` is set to `k // 2`, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and if `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decremented by 1.
