Postcondition: **`z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, the first element of `a` decreased by 1, `k` is the second element of `a` and must be a positive integer, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0, `i` is 0, `a[d]` is decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` (which is now 0) equals 0, then `a[g]` remains 0.**
