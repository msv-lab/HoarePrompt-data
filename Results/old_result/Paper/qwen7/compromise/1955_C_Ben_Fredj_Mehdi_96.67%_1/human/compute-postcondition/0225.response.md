Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(k // 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state of `a[g]` and `a[d]` is known based on the conditions provided. However, since these variables are not part of the loop head, their states do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

3. **Adjust the loop head variables**:
   - `i`: This variable starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - `k`: This variable remains unchanged within the loop unless explicitly modified inside the loop body. Since no modification of `k` is mentioned, `k` remains the same.

Given the above points, let's determine the new state:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `k` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the exact values of `i` and `k` were not provided in the initial state, we will express them in terms of their previous values.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a[g]` is either `int(a[g]) - 1` or `0` (if it was `int(a[g]) - 1` and became 0), and `a[d]` is either `int(a[d]) - 1` or `int(a[d]) - 2` (if it was `int(a[d]) - 1` and became 0), `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same**.
