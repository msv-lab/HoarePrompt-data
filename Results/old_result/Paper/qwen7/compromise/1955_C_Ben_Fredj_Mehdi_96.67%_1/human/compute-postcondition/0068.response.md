Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and it is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to 2.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and it is explicitly stated that `k` is equal to 1,000,000,000.
- The list `a` is explicitly stated to be `[1000000000, 1000000000]`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('0')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'0'`.

Output: **0**
