Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant for the print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is explicitly stated to be `99999999999999`.
- Either `n` is not equal to `101`, or `k` is not equal to `100000000000`, or the first element of `a` is not `1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('99999')
```

Given the conditions, the print statement will output the string `'99999'`. This is because the value of `k` is explicitly set to `99999999999999`, and regardless of the values of `n` and the first element of `a`, the print statement directly outputs the string `'99999'`.

Output: **99999**
