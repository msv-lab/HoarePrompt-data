Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x] + a[0]`, `ans2` is equal to the new value of `ans1`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, and `i + x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts from `ans1` the value of `2 * a[i + x] + a[0]`. Since `i` is 1 and `i + x` is less than `n`, the index `i + x` is valid. The value of `ans2` is updated to be equal to the new value of `ans1`. The other variables (`k` and `n`) remain unchanged.
