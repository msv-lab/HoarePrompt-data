Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by `2 * x * k`, and `i + x` must be less than `n`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The line `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` does not change the values of `ans1`, `i`, `k`, or `t`. It only updates `ans2` to be the maximum of its current value and `ans1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
