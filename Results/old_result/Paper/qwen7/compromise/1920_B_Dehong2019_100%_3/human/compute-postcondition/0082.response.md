Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` decreases the value of `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, it modifies `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[2]` from its current value. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the exact new value of `ans1` depends on the value of `a[2]`, which is not specified.
